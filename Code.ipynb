Raut made fun of Shinde by claiming , \" He himself is Hamas . Hamas and Lashkar e Taiba , two terrorist groups , are completely irrelevant in Maharashtra . But the BJP is to blame for sowing the worms in their the Shinde faction thoughts , said Raut . When Shinde made a statement at the Tuesday Dussehra rally in Mumbai Azad Maidan , Raut reacted to it . As part of the opposition alliance INDIA , Uddhav Thackeray Shiv Sena UBT has formed an alliance with Congress and the Samajwadi Party . Shinde remarked of this alliance : \" For their own selfishness , they will tie the knot with Hamas and Lashkar e Taiba . \" Raut highlighted that Shinde address differed from the customary Dussehra rallies conducted by the Shiv Sena each year . Raut expressed that he could make various remarks , but we adhere to the principles and values of Balasaheb Thackeray . Balasaheb Thackeray used to focus on the nation and its citizens . However , Shinde entire speech was centered on bolstering the BJP , reinforcing the position of Modi ji , and fortifying JP Nadda ji . In response to the provided statement , Raut expressed his view that the occasion was Dussehra , a day traditionally associated with auspiciousness . However , he criticized Shinde for focusing on contentious matters and likened him to \" Hamas \" and \" Al Qaeda of Maharashtra . \" Raut also mentioned that Shinde had , in his Dussehra speech , questioned the alliance between Shiv Sena UBT and Akhilesh Yadav Samajwadi Party , citing an incident from 1990 when Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav had reportedly ordered the use of force against karsevaks in Ayodhya . This event marked the first time that Thackeray and Shinde , leaders of the divergent factions of the Shiv Sena , organized separate Dussehra rallies in Mumbai , marking a departure from the party historical practices .',\n",

Addressing an event organised to express solidarity with the Palestine people by the Indian United Muslim League IUML in Kerala Kozhikode on Thursday , Tharoor urged Israel to end air strikes in Gaza adding that India has always stood for peace since Mahatama Gandhi . \" Since 19 days , the world is seeing the worst human rights tragedies .

We are condemning the bombing of Israel , \" Tharoor said at the event held at Kozhikode beach .

India has always stood for peace since Gandhi . \" He also highlighted that the ongoing crisis is not a Muslim issue but a human rights issue and said \" war knows no religion . \" \" Israel calls their operation , Swords of Iron , but now those swords are dipped in the blood of children . The bombing has caused a lot of injuries and innocent people are suffering and they are dying . Many are living under suffocating occupation , \" Tharoor said . He said that over Palestinians and 300 Isrealis were killed in clashes in the area between 2008 and September this year and the number of those who died since October 7 , however , was much more . \" While Israelis died in the Hamas terrorist attack , many more were killed in Gaza when Israel responded to it Innocent civilians are dying , \" Tharoor said .

While addressing the rally , IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty said that the biggest weapon in the world is public opinion and that showing solidarity will bring results . \" Children are dying . We all are here to shed tears for the brutality in Gaza . We have no weapons to send there or save them . This rally will yield fruit because the biggest weapon in the world is public opinion . Global leaders are joining in solidarity . That how we also joined this . Solidarity has made results here . Killings should stop in Palestine , \" he said . IUML Party workers gathered in strength for Thursday rally , which was presided over by Kunhalikutty with Shashi Tharoor as Chief Guest . IUML state president Panakkad Sayyid Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal inaugurated the rally . In his speech , Thangal said \" Israel occupation has created Palestine conflict . They are trying to survive . They are trying the defend their land . Stop genocide killings . This conflict has started since 1947 . Gandhi criticised Israeli occupation . Nehru , Manmohan Singh , even Vajpayee also took a stand against the Israeli occupation of Palestine They all stood with justice .

India policy is to support the vulnerable people . Israel is the biggest terrorist country . Whoever is supporting Israel they are supporting terror . Justice will rise over there that why we are having this rally . With our prayers let their wounds be healed , \" the IUML leader said .

              " 'Uddhav buried Bal Thackeray Hindutva for power ; may hug Hamas one day : Shinde Mumbai , Oct 24 PTI Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday launched a blistering attack on Shiv Sena UBT leader Uddhav Thackeray saying he buried the Hindutva ideology of Bal Thackeray for power and joined hands with Congress and socialist parties . Addressing a massive gathering at the Dussehra rally of Shiv Sena in Azad Maidan , Shinde , without naming Thackeray , said he back stabbed Bal Thackeray by committing dishonesty with his ideological legacy . Shinde also said he wo be surprised if they Shiv Sena UBT ally with Asaduddin Owaisi led AIMIM and even \" hug terrorist organisations such as Hamas , Hizbul Mujahideen , Lashkar e Toiba for their selfish motives and chair power \" . He also reiterated that the state government is committed to granting quota to Maraths which will stand the legal scrutiny and appealed to youths not to take extreme steps like committing suicide . \" You have buried the Hindutva ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray by going with Congress and Samajwadis for power . Balasaheb had given Garv se kaho hum Hindu hai slogan from Shivtirth Shivaji Park ground but slogans like Garv se kaho hum Congressi and Samajwadi hai are being given from that venue , \" Shinde said . The Shiv Sena faction led by Uddhav Thackeray organised a conventional annual Dussehra rally on Shivaji Park ground in Dadar , which the party terms Shivtirth . He said the parties who used to target the BJP by questioning the timeline for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya are feeling embarrassed now . \" They have lost their face . How will they go to Ayodhya now ? \" he asked . Shinde claimed Uddhav Thackeray nurtured the ambition to become the CM since 2004 but things did work out . \" It was his Uddhav wish to become the CM since 2004 but the jugaad did work out . He pretended that he was never interested in the post . It was said publicly that he accepted the responsibility after the 2019 assembly elections on the advice of Sharad Pawar . But the fact is that two persons were sent to Pawar to recommend his Uddhav name for the post , \" he said . Targeting the INDIA bloc of opposition parties , Shinde said the people will bury \" the ten headed INDIA alliance Ravan in 2024 polls \" . He said PM Modi will come to power for the third consecutive term next year and \" We will send 45 MPs out of 48 from Maharashtra to strengthen his hand \" . Shinde said it was Modi who had fulfilled the dreams of Bal Thackeray by removing Article 370 and facilitating the construction of Ram temple . \" Once Balasaheb had said that if he became PM for a day , he would build Ram Mandir and repeal Article 370 . Now under Modi guidance , Ram Mandir is being constructed in Ayodhya and Article 370 is scrapped , \" he added . Shinde said those who used to taunt regarding the timeline for the construction of the Ram temple have lost their face as Modi has given the schedule of its construction . \" We all will go to Ayodhya for the inauguration of the temple \" . He said the massive crowd at Azad Maidan shows a saffron wave is prevailing in Maharashtra . \" This is the azad Shiv Sena azad rally at Azad Maidan , which is associated with the freedom struggle , \" he said . Against the backdrop of the acrimony between two factions of Shiv Sena over the venue of the annual Dussehra rally , Shinde said he considers any place as Shivtirth where Bal Thackeray thoughts can be shared openly . In a jibe at Uddhav , he said , \" Those who claim to have blood relations with Balasaheb have suppressed his thoughts \" . Terming Uddhav Thackray and his son Aaditya as \" one full , one half \" , Shinde said he wo be surprised if they merge their faction with Congress . Speaking on the Maratha quota issue , Shinde said since he is from an ordinary Maratha family , he understands their pain and sorrow . \" I am aware of their pain and sorrow . The Justice Shinde retd committee is working 24 hours and a curative petition has been filed in the Supreme Court which had struck down the Maratha quota and it has been admitted . Hence a window has been opened , \" the chief minister said . Midway in his speech , Shinde bowed before the bust of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on the dais and vowed to grant the reservation to the Maratha community . Without doing injustice to anyone and without withdrawing reservation of anyone , this government will provide a quota to the Maratha community that will last permanently , Shinde said . Appealing to youths to not take extreme steps like committing suicide for quota , Shinde said they should think of their families and children before taking any extreme step . He said Bal Thackeray had castigated Mani Shankar Aiyar and Congress for \" insulting \" VD Savarkar , but they Uddhav are now serving the same Congress .

He was opening an event organised by the IUML on the Kozhikode beach on Thursday to extend support to Palestine . The Thangal said the Palestinian people had been resisting the invasion attempts by Israel since 1947 . Their land , properties , everything is being taken over and they are displaced from their land . Resistance has been their oxygen for long . A well known Palestinian poet has described his people as dead bodies that breathe , he said . The IUML leader pointed out that India had been supporting them after realising Israel hidden agenda of invasion . People like Mahatma Gandhi , father of our nation , have criticised the invasion . Prime Ministers from Nehru to Manmohan Singh continued that line . Even Atal Bihari Vajpayee was supporting Palestine . The current dispensation at the Centre , however , has diluted our position and is seen whitewashing Israel . It is condemnable , he said . Terming Israel the biggest terrorist nation in the world , the Thangal said countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom were found to be supporting it . These Western nations , which always talk about human rights , were turning a blind eye towards what was happening in Gaza . A free Palestine is the only solution , for which political talks should be held . Israel should stop its terrorist activities and fall in line , he added . Thousands of people , including a large number of women , from across northern Kerala districts gathered on the beach to attend the event , which also proved to be a show of strength of the IUML ahead of the Lok Sabha polls .

The number of those who died since October 7 , however , was much more . While Israelis died in the Hamas terrorist attack , many more were killed in Gaza when Israel responded to it . The response is continuing too . At the same time , a total of 101 Palestinians and one Israeli are dead in West Bank , which is an occupied area . In Lebanon , 52 Palestinians and four Israelis have died , he said . Israel has termed its attack Operation Sword of Iron . Before this war ends , that sword will have to be dipped in the blood of how many children we do know , Tharoor said . The Congress leader also accused Israel of violating international agreements on war such as the Geneva Convention while pounding Gaza . He said hapless children and women were getting killed and religious places of worship , including an Orthodox church over years old , were destroyed . The UN relief agency had said it was left with no or little fuel . Hospitals are facing difficulties while attending to the wounded . There is no clean water , power , petrol or diesel . Israel is allowing very few trucks from Egypt carrying essentials to enter Gaza , Tharoor said . He ended his speech calling for a ceasefire by Israel and quoted the late Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish , The war will end , the leaders will shake hands , the old woman will keep waiting for her martyred son , That girl will wait for her beloved husband . And those children will wait for their hero father . I do know who sold our homeland , But I saw who paid the price .',\n",

Tharoor was the chief guest at the Palestine solidarity rally in Kozhikode . The IUML handpicked Tharoor as the keynote speaker at the event , bypassing prominent faces of the party state leadership , considering the erudition of the diplomat turned politician on international affairs . Advertisement It may be recalled that the CWC in a resolution on October 9 had reaffirmed its support to the Palestinian cause without mentioning the October 7 attack carried out by Hamas on Israel . The CWC expresses its dismay and anguish on the war that has broken out in the Middle East where over a thousand people have been killed in the last two days . The CWC reiterates its long standing support for the rights of the Palestinian people to land , self government and to live with dignity and respect . The CWC calls for an immediate cease fire and for negotiations to begin on all outstanding issues including the imperative issues that have given rise to the present conflict , the CWC resolution had said . However , the party did a course correction later when its spokesperson Pavan Khera condemned the Hamas attack on Israel . The Congress unequivocally condemns the attack on the innocent civilians of Israel by Hamas , Khera had said on October 13 . Advertisement Referring to the present bout of war between Hamas and Israel , Tharoor said , On October 7 , terrorists attacked Israel , killed people and took 200 hostages . In answer to that , Israel has so far killed people . They have stopped the supply of food , water and fuel to Gaza . Hospitals are bombed . Innocent people are being killed every day . What is happening is the violation of war laws and Geneva Convention , which have provisions for protecting the innocent civilians . Advertisement He continued . one thing I want to say . When those terrorists massacred unarmed people , the world had condemned it . Now , everyone is condemning the Israel bombing . Terrorist acts took place from both sides . Eye for eye would make the whole world blind . What we are seeing now is a heinous reaction . We are seeing a disproportionate reaction , he said . Advertisement Tharoor said the death toll in the latest bout of crisis in the last 19 days is more than the casualty that took place in the last 15 years . Around Israelis and Palestinians have been killed so far . The West Bank region had not witnessed any terrorism . However , 102 Palestine people and one Israeli were killed , he said . Tharoor said the issue should not be considered as a Muslim issue on the ground that the rally is being conducted by IUML , a secular and democratic party . None should think that this is a Muslim issue . It is a matter of human rights . War knows no religion . Christians in Gaza were also killed in the bombing , he said . At the same venue , senior IUML leader and party legislator Dr M K Muneer , apparently took a dig at Tharoor . Advertisement Muneer , in his address , said , When Bhagat Singh and Subhas Chandra Bose fought for the freedom of the country , it was recorded in British history as an act of terrorism and extremism . At Gaza , the fight of Palestine for freedom would be an act of terrorism in the eye of imperialistic forces . But the children at Gaza now say that they were now offering namaz not five times a day , but six times . The children say every day they have janaza funeral prayer . The fight of Palestine is freedom struggle and that of Israel is genocide . We are with that defence of Palestine . We should be able to differentiate between defence and attack , he said . Since the latest crisis in the Middle East , both Congress and in Kerala have been treading cautiously on the issue , considering visible pro Palestine sentiments in the state . central committee member K K Shailaja had come under fire from within the party itself after she dubbed Hamas as terrorists . Later , she had to drop the terror tag from Hamas , in a clarification on her views on the crisis .',\n",

In his speech , he criticised Uddhav Thackeray . Addressing a huge rally at Shiv Sena Dussehra rally at Azad Maidan , without naming Thackeray , Shinde said he had stabbed Bal Thackeray in the back by dishonesty with his ideological heritage . Eknath Shinde said that Uddhav Thackeray left the Hindutva ideology long ago and can now even embrace Islamic terrorist outfits like Hamas . Shiv Teerth is at a place where Balasaheb Thackeray ideology is continued Wishing one and all on the occasion of Dussehra , Eknath Shinde said , This is an Azad meeting of an Azad Shiv Sena on the Azad Maidan . It is this Azad Maidan where people would stage protests in the pre independence era against British rule . Balasaheb Thackeray used to address the Dussehra meeting on Shiv Teerth Shivaji Park ground . People are holding their rallies at that place today . We are at Azad Maidan . But we believe that Shiv Teerth is at a place where Balasaheb Thackeray ideology is continued . CM Eknath Shinde said , I am the Chief Minister of this state . I could have easily held the meeting at Shivaji Park Ground last year as well as this year . But I do not want the state to witness unnecessary fights and troubles . Last year we held this meeting at Bandra Kurla Complex Ground . This year we are at Azad Maidan . Uddhav Thackeray can embrace terrorist outfits like Hamas Eknath Shinde said , It would not be surprising if they Shiv Sena UBT ally with the Asaduddin Owaisi led All India Majlis e Ittehadul Muslimeen AIMIM . They would even embrace terrorist organisations like Hamas , Hizbul Mujahideen , and Lashkar e Taiba for their selfish purposes and power . Eknath Shinde added , He buried Bal Thackeray Hindutva ideology for power and joined hands with the Congress and the Samajwadi Party . Balasaheb had raised the slogan Proudly say we are Hindus from Shiv Teerth , but slogans like Proudly say we are Congressmen and socialists are being given from that place . Eknath Shinde also targeted Uddhav Thackeray for questioning the dates of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya . He said , The parties that used to target the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP by questioning the timeline for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya are now feeling embarrassed . They are now exposed . How will they go to Ayodhya now ? Uddhav Thackeray wanted to become the chief minister of the state in 2004 Shinde claimed that Uddhav Thackeray had ambitions of becoming chief minister since 2004 , but it could not happen . He said , He wished to become the chief minister since 2004 but the jugaad did not work . He showed that he had never been interested in this post . It was publicly stated that he accepted the responsibility for Sharad Pawar advice after the 2019 assembly elections . But the fact is that two persons were sent to Pawar to recommend his name for this post . He is wearing many masks . He takes advantage of the opportunity . Narendra Modi fulfilled the dreams of Balasaheb Thackeray Eknath Shinde said , Prime Minister Narendra Modi will come to power for the third consecutive time next year . We will send 45 MPs from Maharashtra to strengthen him . It was Modi who fulfilled Bal Thackeray dreams through the removal of Article 370 and the construction of Ram Mandir . People will bury the 10 headed alliance Ravana in the 2024 elections . Committed to Maratha Reservation Eknath Shinde said , The state government is committed to giving reservation to the Maratha community in a manner that the reservation will stand in the legal test . I appeal to Maratha youths not to suicide .',\n",

LDF MLA K T Jaleel also criticised Tharoor and said his speech would give the impression that it was a pro Israel rally .

              " 'At IUML rally , Shashi Tharoor calls Hamas action terrorist attack , MK Muneer terms it resistance Kozhikode : Congress leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor termed the Hamas attack against Israel as a \" terrorist act at the rally held by the Indian Union Muslim League in solidarity with Palestine . He used the term multiple times throughout the speech . Tharoor condemned the disproportionate retaliation of Israel and stated that the country was committing war crimes . He reminded that India has always stood with Palestine and even Mahatma Gandhi was against the formation of Israel in Arab land . However , Dr MK Muneer , MLA , who spoke last at the event , without naming Tharoor , said that resistance and attack are different and the Muslim League always supports Palestine . Excerpts from the speech by Tharoor : For the past 19 days , the world has been witnessing one of the worst human rights tragedies . Thousands of people died , including innocent women and children . First in Israel , then in Gaza . There are historical reasons and people may have their own arguments , but no one can justify actions that trouble people . India has always stood for peace , since the time of Gandhiji . We have always stood for a permanent solution to this crisis . For Israelis and Palestinians living side by side with dignity and security in their own lands and behind their own borders . But that is not what we are seeing . On October 7 , terrorists attacked Israel and killed individuals and took 200 people hostage . But in retaliation , Israel killed people . The MP added that Israel was violating war laws . There are some laws even for war , like the one to protect innocent civilians . But Israel violates everything . Humanitarian aid is not sufficient as they do let it enter Gaza . When terrorists attacked innocent women and children , the world condemned them . But we also condemned when Israel bombed . Gandhi once said , an eye for an eye will make the whole world blind . As I said earlier , terrorist activities have taken place on both sides . The death toll is higher than in the last 15 years of war . During that period , more than Palestinians died . Around 300 Israelis also died . Palestinians live under suffocating occupation . Even during these days , in the West Bank where there were no terrorist activities , 102 Palestinians were killed while only one Israeli died . IUML is a secular party . This rally is not to highlight a Muslim issue . This is a human rights issue . War knows no religion . Christians were also killed in Gaza . Tharoor also narrated the history of the Israel Palestine conflict . He recalled that India stood with Palestine and opposed the creation of Israel . Muneer reply While speaking at the event , MLA MK Muneer said : \" Britishers consider the fights of Bhagat Singh and Subhash Chandra Bose as a terrorist act . Similarly , the imperialists consider the fight in Gaza as a terrorist act . The children of Palestine say they pray six times a day , including Janazah funeral prayer in Islam . Palestine is fighting for freedom while Israel is committing a genocide . As Bertolt Brecht said , the most beautiful of all doubts is when the downtrodden and despondent raise their heads and stop believing in the strength of their oppressors .',\n",

              " ' Mumbai , Oct 24 SocialNews . XYZ Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena President Eknath Shinde on Tuesday bowed and vowed before a portrait of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to give reservations to the Maratha community , and fight for justice to them till the last drop of blood in his body . In an emotional moment while addressing his second Dassehra Rally at Azad Maidan late this evening , Shinde cut short his speech , walked to the other end of the state and with folded hands and bowed head made the solemn commitment for quotas . \" I am also a Maratha and I have struggled very hard for the community all my life . I take the oath before Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj that quotas for the Marathas will be given without disturbing the reservations for any other groups All are our people and no injustice will be done to any community . I urge the Maratha youth not to resort to any desperate suicide measures , \" he said . Attacking the Shiv Sena UBT , Shinde said that he belonged to a poor farmer family and struggled all his life to reach this position today , endured caning and even went to jail . How many cases you have against you , how many times you have taken caning ? Those who claim to be heirs to Balasaheb Thackeray legacy must first examine their conduct They are not a dena give bank , but a lena take bank . I have not hankered for power and I continue to function as an ordinary worker , I go to Davos Switzerland for business or inspect drains and public toilets in slums said Shinde . On the contrary , the CM alleged that Uddhav Thackeray coveted the post of CM since 2004 and for this he had sent two emissaries to meet Sharad Pawar to become the CM , and betrayed the Hindutva cause of Balasaheb Thackeray . \" For us , Balasaheb Thackeray ideals are our principles but how many times you have compromised them for money and power . Tomorrow , it wo be surprising if his party Shiv Sena UBT merges with the Congress , or joins hands with the AIMIM , or with the Hamas , Hizbul and Lashkar e Taiba They do care about the common Shiv Sainiks , they are concerned only with their family , \" he claimed . The CM targeted Thackeray for pushing behind the state in terms of investments , and claimed that in just one year , along with Deputy CMs Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar Maharashtra has catapulted to the top slot in FDI , development is happening briskly on all fronts , and wherever he travels , \" the people are happy with the progress \" . Shinde called upon the people to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2024 elections by giving at least 45 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra to the BJP . Modi is fulfilling the dreams of Balasaheb Thackeray like repealing Article 370 in Jammu Kashmir or constructing the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya I have done the work of saving the Shiv Sena which was mortgaged with the Congress Nationalist Congress Party SP , \" declared Shinde . Responding to Thackeray criticism on delinking Mumbai from Maharashtra , Shinde asserted that till I am alive , nobody father will dare to do this . Recounting the alleged scams of the erstwhile Maha Vikas Aghadi government especially during the c coronavirus pandemic , Shinde said that you were at home busy counting money you ate up the khichdi money and the oxygen funds , and warned that the people of Maharashtra will teach them a lesson for their sins . \" Uddhav Thackeray had no great achievements , that is why Anand Dighe former Thane strongman had praised Raj Thackeray in a meeting And for this Dighe was humiliated , and I have witnessed it myself . After that appreciation of Raj Thackeray , the work of clipping Dighe wings started , \" he claimed . On the decision to hold the rally at Azad Maidan , Shinde said that as the CM , he would have easily conducted the meeting at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Park , also known as Shiv Tirth . However , we opted for Azad Maidan to avoid any law and order problems and for us wherever we carry forward the vision of Balasaheb Thackeray becomes our Shiv Tirth . We shall always hold our future rallies at this venue , \" he said . Quaid Najmi can be contacted at : Source : IANS',\n",

Taking a dig at the Thiruvananthapuram MP , Swaraj , a state secretariat member of the , said what he had done was an Israel solidarity meeting at the expense of the IUML . Facing intense social media attack from pro Hamas groups and a section of Left activists , Tharoor issued a clarification , saying he has always been with the people of Palestine and he does not agree with the propagation of just one sentence from his speech , which he made at the IUML rally . \" I have always been with the people of Palestine , \" Tharoor said in a short video released by the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee KPCC . Earlier , in a Facebook post , leader Swaraj remarked sarcastically that Tharoor was pretty sure that what had happened from the side of Palestine was a \" terrorist strike , \" even though 90 per cent of that country was lost to Israel . He was also sure that what had happened from the side of Israel post October 7 was its \" reply \" , the Left leader said . \" Tharoor is not a man who does not know the meaning of words . He is also not a person who was unaware that history had not begun on October 7 , \" Swaraj further said . Still , the Congress leader has failed to admit that Israel is a \" terrorist nation , \" he said . Israel from Tel Aviv and Tharoor from the IUML rally were attacking Palestine , the former MLA further alleged . LDF MLA K T Jaleel also criticised Tharoor and said his speech would give the impression that it was a pro Israel rally . The IUML rally was held in solidarity with Israel , and if anyone listened to the speech of the main speaker , it would give such an impression , he charged in a FB post . IUML leader P K Kunhalikutty , however , criticised the groups that were allegedly trying to create controversy over the rally . He said the huge rally organised by the League has helped generate public opinion in favour of the Palestinian cause and Tharoor has already clarified that he is with the Palestinian cause . The IUML , a key ally of the Congress led United Democratic Front UDF in Kerala , organised a massive rally in northern Kozhikode on Thursday denouncing the reported indiscriminate killings of civilians , including women and children , in the Israeli attack on the Gaza strip . Tens of thousands of IUML supporters took part in the Palestine Solidarity Human Rights rally , inaugurated by IUML leader Panakkad Syed Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal . Tharoor , who was the chief guest , had lamented what he termed as \" one of the most distressing human rights catastrophes \" witnessed over the past 19 days . \" This may well be one of the most significant political rallies we have seen in India and perhaps across the world in defence of human rights and in favour of peace . This is a rally for peace , \" the Thiruvananthapuram MP said . He said that innocent women and children had suffered casualties , initially in Israel and subsequently in Gaza , and emphasised the imperative of ending this conflict . Tharoor underscored India historical commitment to peace , tracing it back to the era of Mahatma Gandhi . \" We have always stood for a permanent solution to this crisis , \" he said . In unequivocal terms , Tharoor also condemned the attack carried out by Palestinian armed group Hamas in Israel on October 7 , describing it as an act of terror . \" On October 7 , terrorists attacked Israel and claimed lives . Two hundred individuals were taken hostage . In response , Israel killed people . The bombing continues , \" he had said . Let the Truth be known .

You can not give collective punishment just because a few have erred . It is people like us who suffer , he tells IANS . The diplomatic row that erupted after Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot in Canada , and the Canadian Prime Minister alleged the possible involvement of Indian security agencies has now led to the expulsion of 41 Canadian diplomats and a visa ban from India . Maintaining that it is only a minuscule Punjabi population in Canada that raises the demand for Khalistan , and the majority continues to be pro India , Dosanjh , who publicly took on the Khalistanis in the and survived a major attack with almost 100 stitches , feels that the whole situation could have been handled more maturely . Let us not forget that Justin Trudeau is surrounded by Khalistanis . However , he should have made the statement in Parliament with some kind of proof . Of course , the fact that the media was all set to publish the story , and he had to act fast is also understandable , he says . While stressing that in a free country like Canada , there is nothing wrong in demanding Khalistan , the former Health Minister asserts that keeping in mind the friendly relations between the two countries , the Canadian Prime Minister should make it clear that he does not support the dismemberment of India . It did not take long for the Canadian PM to condemn the glorification of the violence Hamas unleashed on Israel recently , what is stopping from condemning the violence of Khalistanis in Canada ? By the way , I also wonder if some people in Canada are so interested in the idea of Khalistan , why do they come here Dosanjh , who was recently at the Khushwant Singh Literary Festival in Kasauli , added that contrary to popular perception in India , the idea of Khalistan has very little role to play in Canadian elections , adds , It is the state of the economy that drives people voting behaviour . Believing that a little more maturity shown by leaders of both countries can be instrumental in putting the Indo Canadian relations back on track , he says even the Indian side needs to be less touchy and jingoistic . Trudeau had other platforms to raise the issue and not make a statement like that in the Parliament . The Indian side can formally request countries for extradition , and stop using international issues for domestic gains . Looking back at his political career in Canada , he says his heart has always been that of an activist and not a politician . When I ran , and I won . I never thought I would do all the things that I did , he concludes .',\n",

However , the politician is getting a warm welcome in Kozhikode where he started the new journey , with the latest event being the Palestine solidarity rally of the Indian Union Muslim League , a UDF ally . When he decided to shift focus to the dynamic world of Kerala politics in November 2022 following his defeat at the Congress presidential polls , his presence sparked both curiosity and concern within and outside the Congress party . Tharoor journey began in Kozhikode , where his lecture program , initially organised by the Youth Congress , faced resistance and was halted due to internal repercussions . State and national leaders were wary of the programme . But it was Kozhikode DCC that made the move to block the event . Despite the initial setback , Tharoor found support from various quarters , both within and outside the Congress . The ban imposed on his lecture programmes only fueled public curiosity , and Tharoor found an alternative platform with the Jawahar Foundation . Notable leaders like MPs MK Raghavan and K Muralidharan openly supported him . Later , AICC in charge Tariq Anwar intervened and KPCC asked Tharoor to cooperate with the organisational set up .

IMAGE : Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde addresses during the Dussehra rally on the occasion of Dussehra , at Azad Maidan in Mumbai on Tuesday . Photograph : ANI Photo Addressing a massive gathering at the Dussehra rally of Shiv Sena in Azad Maidan , Shinde , without naming Thackeray , said he back stabbed Bal Thackeray by committing dishonesty with his ideological legacy . Shinde also said he wo be surprised if they Shiv Sena UBT ally with Asaduddin Owaisi led All India Majlis e Ittehadul Muslimeen and even hug terrorist organisations such as Hamas , Hizbul Mujahideen , Lashkar e Taiba for their selfish motives and chair power . He also reiterated that the state government is committed to granting quota to Maraths which will stand the legal scrutiny and appealed to youths not to take extreme steps like committing suicide . \" You have buried the Hindutva ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray by going with Congress and Samajwadis for power . Balasaheb had given Garv se kaho hum Hindu hai slogan from Shivtirth Shivaji Park ground but slogans like Garv se kaho hum Congressi and Samajwadi hain are being given from that venue , \" Shinde said . The Shiv Sena faction led by Uddhav Thackeray organised a conventional annual Dussehra rally on Shivaji Park ground in Dadar , which the party terms Shivtirth . He said the parties who used to target the Bharatiya Janata Party by questioning the timeline for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya are feeling embarrassed now . \" They have lost their face . How will they go to Ayodhya now ? \" he asked . Shinde claimed Uddhav Thackeray nurtured the ambition to become the CM since 2004 but things did work out . \" It was his Uddhav wish to become the CM since 2004 but the jugaad did work out . He pretended that he was never interested in the post . It was said publicly that he accepted the responsibility after the 2019 assembly elections on the advice of Sharad Pawar . But the fact is that two persons were sent to Pawar to recommend his Uddhav name for the post , \" he said . Targeting the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance INDIA of opposition parties , Shinde said the people will bury the ten headed INDIA alliance Ravan in 2024 polls . He said PM Modi will come to power for the third consecutive term next year and We will send 45 MPs out of 48 from Maharashtra to strengthen his hand . Shinde said it was Modi who had fulfilled the dreams of Bal Thackeray by removing Article 370 and facilitating the construction of Ram temple . \" Once Balasaheb had said that if he became PM for a day , he would build Ram Mandir and repeal Article 370 . Now under Modi guidance , Ram Mandir is being constructed in Ayodhya and Article 370 is scrapped , \" he added . Shinde said those who used to taunt regarding the timeline for the construction of the Ram temple have lost their face as Modi has given the schedule of its construction . \" We all will go to Ayodhya for the inauguration of the temple \" . He said the massive crowd at Azad Maidan shows a saffron wave is prevailing in Maharashtra . \" This is the azad Shiv Sena azad rally at Azad Maidan , which is associated with the freedom struggle , \" he said . Against the backdrop of the acrimony between two factions of Shiv Sena over the venue of the annual Dussehra rally , Shinde said he considers any place as Shivtirth where Bal Thackeray thoughts can be shared openly . In a jibe at Uddhav , he said , \" Those who claim to have blood relations with Balasaheb have suppressed his thoughts . \" Terming Uddhav Thackray and his son Aaditya as one full , one half , Shinde said he wo be surprised if they merge their faction with Congress . Speaking on the Maratha quota issue , Shinde said since he is from an ordinary Maratha family , he understands their pain and sorrow . \" I am aware of their pain and sorrow . The Justice Shinde retd committee is working 24 hours and a curative petition has been filed in the Supreme Court which had struck down the Maratha quota and it has been admitted . Hence a window has been opened , \" the chief minister said . Midway in his speech , Shinde bowed before the bust of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on the dais and vowed to grant the reservation to the Maratha community . Without doing injustice to anyone and without withdrawing reservation of anyone , this government will provide a quota to the Maratha community that will last permanently , Shinde said . Appealing to youths to not take extreme steps like committing suicide for quota , Shinde said they should think of their families and children before taking any extreme step . He said Bal Thackeray had castigated Mani Shankar Aiyar and Congress for insulting VD Savarkar , but they Uddhav are now serving the same Congress .',\n",

              " 'Tamil Nadu : Post crude bomb attack on Raj Bhawan , police in dock over investigation ; NIA steps in The crude bomb attack on the Raj Bhawan has unnerved the authorities . Notably , Raj Bhavan itself has expressed dissatisfaction with the police handling of the case . In a statement posted on social media , Raj Bhavan claimed that the police had not registered their complaint regarding the attack . Instead , the police , on their own initiative , treated the incident as a simple act of vandalism . To further complicate matters , the police hastily arrested the accused , leading to his remand in jail at midnight . This abrupt move also involved waking up a magistrate late in the night and preventing a more detailed interrogation that might have shed light on those responsible for the attack . Raj Bhavan statement conveyed a deep concern that a fair investigation had been thwarted before it could even begin . The implications of this incident and the subsequent handling by the authorities have prompted the National Investigation Agency NIA to step in , aiming to uncover the startling aspects of the case that have come to light . In a concerning incident at Guindy Raj Bhavan , a habitual offender and history sheeter who was released on bail just three days prior breached the high security zone and threw country bombs on the premises . The incident took place on the afternoon of October 25 . The police initially reported that the bombs landed near the barricade at the front gate , causing no damage , and that the assailant was swiftly arrested . However , a complaint filed by Deputy Secretary to the Governor , Sengottaiyan , provided a contrasting version of events . In his complaint to the Commission of Greater Chennai , Sengottaiyan described a severe attack against the Constitutional Head of the State of Tamil Nadu . According to the complaint , a miscreant armed with petrol bombs attempted to breach Main Gate No . 1 of Raj Bhavan around pm on the same day . It was due to the alertness of the security personnel at the Raj Bhavan that they managed to thwart the assailants entry . The first petrol bomb hurled at the main entrance gate caused a significant damage . Despite the security personnel efforts to subdue the attacker , another petrol bomb was thrown , resulting in severe damage to the entrance . Sengottaiyan further noted that , over several months , there have been ongoing attacks against the honourable governor , often involving verbal abuse and threats to his life . These attacks have predominantly come from leaders and members of the DMK and its allies during public meetings and through social media . Their intent appears to be to intimidate the Governor and hinder him from carrying out his constitutional duties . However , Sengottaiyan pointed out that previous complaints lodged with the police had yielded no significant action or results . He cited a specific incident from April 18 , 2022 , where the Governor was physically attacked with sticks and stones while en route to a scheduled function at the Dharmapuram Adheenam . Despite complaints filed by Raj Bhavan , no FIR was registered , and no action was taken against the culprits . This sequence of events underscores concerns about the governor safety and the need for a thorough investigation into the recent attack on Guindy Raj Bhavan . Amidst various incidents of threats and abuse directed at the Governor , an officer from Raj Bhavan has voiced serious concerns about the police response to these incidents . The officer revealed that previous cases involving public threats to the governor were not treated with the necessary seriousness by the police . In these instances , the police did not faithfully register First Information Reports FIRs and often downplayed the significance of the events , categorising them as minor offences with no meaningful follow up . The officer emphasised that the police studied indifference to the Governor safety had compromised both his security and that of Raj Bhavan . This situation has ultimately culminated in a brazen bomb attack on Raj Bhavan . Expressing his alarm , the officer pointed out that ongoing verbal and physical threats and attacks against the Governor , the highest Constitutional authority in the state , had severely undermined security measures . This deterioration in security is now evident in the recent bomb attack . The officer urged authorities to take serious note of the attack , highlighting that the offences committed fall under Section 124 of the Indian Penal Code IPC , which is specifically intended for threats to the Governor . The officer further emphasised that a governor can not effectively discharge their duties under the constant shadow of threats . As a result , he urged the authorities to take the necessary steps to ensure a thorough investigation , appropriate punishment for those involved in the attacks , including any conspirators , and enhanced security measures for the Governor safety . Press Release No : 71 RAJ BHAVAN , TAMIL NADU October 25 , 2023 In the wake of the bomb attack on Guindy Raj Bhavan , Chennai Police identified the suspect as K Vinod , a known history sheeter and habitual offender with a record of six to seven cases against him . According to the police , Vinod was in an inebriated state when he committed the crime . The police statement regarding Vinod inebriation at the time of the attack follows a common pattern , as it is often used when individuals are accused of attacking temples or engaging in vandalism . A case has been registered against Vinod under various sections of the Indian Penal Code , including sections 436 mischief by fire or explosive substance , 353 assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty , and criminal intimidation . Additionally , charges have been filed under Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act and Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Property Prevention of Damage and Loss Act at the Guindy police station . The police also mentioned that Raj Bhavan complaint regarding the incident was received around 11 pm . They have assured that the details provided in the complaint will be thoroughly examined as part of the ongoing investigation into the bomb attack . In the aftermath of the bomb attack on Guindy Raj Bhavan , several political figures and government officials expressed their viewpoints on the incident . TN BJP State President K Annamalai took to Twitter to claim that the same individual responsible for the attack on the BJP headquarters in Chennai in February 2022 was behind the attack on Raj Bhavan . He expressed concerns about the recurrent attacks and insinuated that the DMK government might be involved in sponsoring these acts . Union Minister L Murugan expressed his dismay over the incident , emphasising that it signifies a breakdown in law and order . He raised concerns about the safety and ability of the constitutional head of the state , the Governor , to perform his duties without threats . Murugan called for the case to be transferred to either the Central Bureau of Investigation CBI or the National Investigation Agency NIA . AIADMK Chief Edappadi Palaniswami characterised the attack as a significant example of the deterioration of law and order in the state . Contrary to the criticisms , DMK Law Minister , Regupathy condemned the attack and denied any security lapse at Raj Bhavan . He affirmed that the Raj Bhavan is well protected and that an investigation is in progress . Unconfirmed reports suggest that the NIA has taken it upon itself to initiate an investigation into the incident . The case continues to unfold as authorities at various levels weigh in on the matter . Amid growing questions about who facilitated bail for habitual criminal Krukku Vinodh , recent information from a News Tamil channel appears to provide indirect answers . Prison authorities are reported to have described Vinodh emergence from jail in the company of banned Popular Front of India PFI cadres as a mere coincidence . Incidentally , this development has unfolded in the context of ongoing protests and demonstrations concerning Palestine . Just two days ago , several Muslim outfits organised a protest in support of Palestine , during which one of the speakers controversially likened Israel and India to two terrorist nations in the world . Following this , the Federation of All Islamic Organisations and some political parties have called for a protest in Chennai on October 31 . However , an alarming incident recently took place in Coimbatore Ukkadam area , where individuals raised a Palestine flag atop a flyover . In response , the police have taken action , arresting Sabir Ali from the Jamaat e Hind outfit , as well as Abu Thahir and Rabeeq from the Manitha Neya Democratic party . Cases have been registered in connection with this incident . Additionally , New College students in Chennai , an institution run by the Muslim Association of Southern India MEASI , organised a demonstration in support of Palestine . The events surrounding the bail arrangement for Vinodh and the broader protests linked to Palestine continue to raise concerns and prompt ongoing discussions . In the wake of the recent bomb attack on the Governor residence , social media influencers have voiced their concerns , characterising the incident as a glaring and extraordinary display of anti social , rowdy , and fundamentalist elements running rampant in the state of Tamil Nadu . They argue that political parties disenchanted with the governor perceived anti Dravidian stance and his disapproval of appeasement policies implemented by both the DMK and AIADMK have aligned with other factions advocating divisive politics . In particular , the influencers point to calls for the premature release of 36 Muslim prisoners and the removal of the BJP party flagpole , following objections from Muslims . These actions , they argue , have emboldened elements within the state to engage in such audacious acts . The influencers also referred to the tragic assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by LTTE cadres in 1991 , which remains vivid in the memories of Tamil Nadu residents . Given this historical context , they contend that providing excessive leeway to Dravidian parties , anti national elements , naxal groups , and fundamentalists could jeopardise not only the state security but also India national security interests at large . These concerns highlight the broader implications of the recent attack on the Governor residence .',\n",

              " 'UN chief Antonio Guterres decries misrepresentation of remarks on Hamas attack as Israel seeks his resignation United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres Wednesday rejected Israel accusations that , in a statement to the Security Council , he had justified attacks by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel , ANI reported \" I am shocked by misrepresentations by some of my statement yesterday in the Security Council as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas \" The Times of Israel reported quoting the US chief . Guterres on Tuesday , without naming Israel , had denounced \" the clear violations of international humanitarian law \" in Gaza and pleaded for civilians to be protected in the conflict between Israel and Hamas . The UN chief told the 15 member Security Council that \" It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum . The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation . \" Guterres said it was \" necessary to set the record straight , especially out of respect for the victims and their families . \" \" But the grievances of the Palestinian people can not justify the appalling attacks by Hamas . And those appalling attacks can not justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people , \" the UN chief said . Earlier , Gilad Erdan , Israel ambassador to the UN , said that his country will deny visas to the UN officials after remarks by UN Chief Guterres that appeared to justify Hamas assault on Israel , reported The Times of Israel . \" Due to his remarks we will refuse to issue visas to UN representatives , \" Erdan tells Army Radio and called on Guterres to resign \" immediately . \" \" The shocking speech by the UN secretary general at the Security Council meeting proved conclusively , beyond any doubt , that the secretary general is completely disconnected from the reality in our region and that he views the massacre committed by Nazi Hamas terrorists in a distorted and immoral manner , \" Erdan said . \" His statement that the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum , expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder .

In neighboring Syria , meanwhile , state media said an Israeli airstrike hit the international airport in the northern city of Aleppo on Wednesday , damaging its runway and putting it out of service . What Is Hezbollah ? How is it organized ? What role has it played in Lebanese politics ? Advertisement For Your Information According to cfr website , Hezbollah is led by Hassan Nasrallah , who took over as secretary general in 1992 after Israel assassinated the group cofounder and previous leader , Abbas Al Musawi . Nasrallah oversees the seven member Shura Council and its five subcouncils : the political assembly , the jihad assembly , the parliamentary assembly , the executive assembly , and the judicial assembly . The State Department estimates that Hezbollah has tens of thousands of members and other supporters worldwide . Hezbollah controls much of Lebanon Shiite majority areas , including parts of Beirut , southern Lebanon , and the eastern Bekaa Valley region . Although Hezbollah is based in Lebanon , its manifesto clarifies that its operations , especially those targeting the United States , are not confined by domestic borders : The American threat is not local or restricted to a particular region , and as such , confrontation of such a threat must be international as well .

Russia passes law to withdraw from ratification of nuclear test ban treaty Syllabus : Preliminary Examination : Current events of national and international importance . Advertisement Mains Examination : General Studies II : Effect of policies and politics of developed and developing countries on India interests , Key Points to Ponder : What the ongoing Russia parliament completed the passage of a law on Wednesday withdrawing ratification of the global treaty banning nuclear weapons tests , evidence of the deep chill in relations with the United States as Moscow pursues its war in Ukraine . Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia was not prepared to resume discussing nuclear issues with the unless Washington dropped its hostile policy . Why Is Russia withdrawing from it ? But why this move by Russia now ? What exactly Russia said regarding the CTBT ? For Your Information The bill to de ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty CTBT was approved by 156 votes to zero in the upper house after the lower house also passed it unanimously . It now goes to President Vladimir Putin for signing . Putin had requested the change to mirror the position of the United States , which signed the CTBT in 1996 but never ratified it . Though it has never formally come into force , the CTBT has made nuclear testing a taboo no country except North Korea has conducted a test involving a nuclear explosion this century . What is Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ? What is the purpose of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ? How did CTBT come into being ? Advertisement For Your Information The United States conducted the world first successful nuclear weapons test in July 1945 . Four years later , the Soviet Union tested their first nuclear weapon . These tests triggered a decades long arms race between the two superpowers . Between 1945 and 1996 , more than nuclear tests were carried out of them by the United States and 715 of them by the Soviet Union , according to the UN . Britain carried out 45 tests , France 210 and China 45 . The radioactive fallout from those tests drew criticism from around the globe . The international community concern about the effects on health and the environment continued to grow , the US Department of State article , History of CTBT , said . As a result , several attempts to curb the explosive tests were made . The 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty LTBT was one of the first such attempts . It prohibited nuclear testing in the atmosphere , outer space , and underwater , but underground tests were still permitted . To tackle the limitations of LTBT , a comprehensive test ban was discussed during the negotiation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1968 . However , no agreement was reached on the issue . Six years later , the US and Soviet Union agreed to sign the Threshold Test Ban Treaty TTBT , which established a nuclear threshold by banning the two countries from conducting tests that would produce a yield exceeding 150 kilotons equivalent to tons of TNT . The mutual restraint imposed by the Treaty reduced the explosive force of new nuclear warheads and bombs , which could otherwise be tested for weapons systems . The TTBT was not intended as a substitute for a comprehensive test ban , the article added . A major breakthrough only came after the Cold War ended around 1990 and the disintegration of the Soviet Union . As the geopolitical tensions simmered down , the UN took advantage of the situation and adopted the CTBT , which put a blanket ban on the explosive testing of nuclear weapons , on September 10 , 1996 , and it opened for signature on September 24 , 1996 .

Key Points to Ponder : Advertisement What the ongoing story BJP MP Nishikant Dubey and lawyer Jai Anant Dehadrai will appear before the Ethics Committee of Lok Sabha at noon on Thursday in connection with Dubey accusation , made in a letter to Speaker Om Birla earlier this month , that Trinamool Congress member Mahua Moitra accepted bribes to ask questions in Parliament targeting the Adani Group . The allegations by Dubey , which he has since taken to Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and the Lokpal , are based on information provided by Dehadrai , which were confirmed by real estate developer Darshan Hiranandani subsequently . Hiranandani , a resident of Dubai , has issued a sworn affidavit saying Moitra gave him her Parliament login and password so he could post questions on her behalf . How serious is Nishikant Dubey accusation ? For Your Information Essentially , the question is whether an MP is asking a question in return for some consideration , and whether there is illegal gratification involved . If this is established , then it is a serious issue . If an MP has asked questions and has done other parliamentary work on behalf of somebody who has paid a consideration , then it should actually come to the Privileges Committee because it is a serious breach of privilege and contempt of the House . This is true for all countries that have a parliamentary system . In such a situation , Parliament can exercise its right to expel the member from the House . What is exactly cash for query case ? Has there been an allegation earlier about an MP handing over access to the Parliament website to someone else ? Is there a rule that specifically bars Members from giving their Parliament login and password to a third person ? So is the Ethics Committee the right forum for a matter such as this ? What will happen once the Committee starts its proceedings on October 26 ? What exactly is the Parliamentary Ethics Committee ? What is the primary role of the Ethics Committee ? For Your Information The members of the Ethics Committee are appointed by the Speaker for a period of one year . The Committee is currently headed by the BJP Kaushambi MP Vinod Kumar Sonkar , and includes Vishnu Datt Sharma , Sumedhanand Saraswati , Aparajita Sarangi , Dr Rajdeep Roy , Sunita Duggal , and Dr Subhash Bhamre of the BJP ; Ve Vaithilingam , N Uttam Kumar Reddy , and Preneet Kaur Congress ; Balashowry Vallabbhaneni YSR Congress ; Hemant Godse Shiv Sena ; Giridhari Yadav JD U ; P R Natarajan CPI M ; and Kunwar Danish Ali BSP . A Presiding Officers Conference held in Delhi in 1996 first mooted the idea of ethics panels for the two Houses . Then Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman K R Narayanan constituted the Ethics Committee of the Upper House on March 4 , 1997 , and it was inaugurated that May to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of members and examine cases of misconduct referred to it . The Rules applicable to the Committee of Privileges also apply to the ethics panel . In the case of Lok Sabha , a study group of the House Committee of Privileges , after visiting Australia , the UK , and the US in 1997 to look into practices pertaining to the conduct and ethics of legislators , recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee , but it could not be taken up by Lok Sabha . The Committee of Privileges finally recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee during the Lok Sabha . The late Speaker , G M C Balayogi , constituted an ad hoc Ethics Committee in 2000 , which became a permanent part of the House only in 2015 . In 2005 , the two Houses adopted motions to expel 10 Lok Sabha MPs and one Rajya Sabha MP who were accused of agreeing to ask questions in Parliament for money . The motion in Lok Sabha was based on the report of a special committee set up by the Speaker under Chandigarh MP P K Bansal to examine the issue . In Rajya Sabha , the complaint was examined by the House Ethics Committee . The BJP , which lost six MPs , demanded that the Bansal Committee report be sent to the Privileges Committee , so that the parliamentarians could defend themselves . Former Lok Sabha Secretary General P D T Achary said there was a lot of evidence in the 2005 case it was based on a sting operation the challenge in the Mahua Moitra case will be to link the questions asked by the TMC MP to a money trail . Any person can complain against a Member through another Lok Sabha MP , along with evidence of the alleged misconduct , and an affidavit stating that the complaint is not false , frivolous , or vexatious . If the Member himself complains , the affidavit is not needed . The Speaker can refer to the Committee any complaint against an MP . The Committee does not entertain complaints based only on media reports or on matters that are sub judice . The Committee makes a prima facie inquiry before deciding to examine a complaint . It makes its recommendations after evaluating the complaint . The Committee presents its report to the Speaker , who asks the House if the report should be taken up for consideration . There is also a provision for a half hour discussion on the report . How long could the Committee take to reach a decision and , should they find merit in the complaint , what is the maximum punishment it could recommend ? Could the Committee refer the matter to an investigative agency like the CBI or police ? Mahua Moitra has pointed out that the Ethics Committee has an absolute majority of BJP Can the MP appeal a potentially adverse decision in a court of law ?

Mains Examination : General Studies III : Conservation , environmental pollution and degradation , environmental impact assessment . Key Points to Ponder : What the ongoing story On the day The Indian Express published a report on how Mumbai civic body took its eyes off the garbage dumping and its burning , the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ordered a complete ban on burning of garbage in the open . Earlier , the city Guardian Minister Deepak Kesarkar said the BMC had sent notices to construction sites to install fogging machines and sprinklers . At a press conference Wednesday , Kesarkar also said the BMC is putting in place a process to soon start segregation of waste extraction of pollutants from the garbage at its two landfills in Deonar and Kanjurmarg . The new set of guidelines to mitigate air pollution announced by the BMC said , There shall be a complete ban on open burning anywhere in the geographical area under BMC , especially garbage dumping grounds and possible sites of trash burning . The new set of guidelines to mitigate air pollution announced by the BMC What are those ? Withdrawal of the southwest monsoon in Mumbai and a spike in the pollution burden on the city residents Connect the dots Why has the air quality been bad in Mumbai of late ? Mumbai overall Air Quality Index touched 191 , way worse than Delhi this happened ? What are the reasons given by experts for the worsening AQI in Mumbai ? Meteorological conditions play a role in pollution . But it should be clear that the weather or climate can not generate air pollution . Air quality deteriorates mainly due to anthropogenic sources of emissions , whether local or distant . Meteorological conditions only help to manoeuvre the pollutants in the Mumbai geography gives it a distinct ? The usual is becoming unusual and getting triggered by additional anthropogenic the reasons for Mumbai pollution Do You Know Last winter , the city experienced record breaking particulate pollution , which was largely related to the unusual triple dip La Nina conditions understood as linked to climate change . An abnormal drop in surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean had a telling effect on coastal wind speeds around Mumbai . There was scarcely any wind reversal from across the Arabian Sea , which would otherwise occur every two to three days and disperse pollutants in the air . In other words , the emission from various anthropogenic sources was not cleaned up and the city experienced its worst air of the decade . La Nina has gone this year . However , the withdrawal of the monsoon was delayed till October . The withdrawal time of monsoon always plays a critical role in Mumbai air quality . The withdrawal is always followed by an anticyclonic circulation that was right above Mumbai and the surrounding regions during the initial days of October . This led to weak ventilation in the city . At the same time , the transport level winds , much above the surface in the atmosphere , were moderately fast and were blowing towards Mumbai from Lonavala and Khandala in the Sahyadri ranges , around ft above sea level . These chilly moderate winds are capable of transporting pollutants towards Mumbai . When these winds started losing energy , they descended near Navi Mumbai and the surrounding coastal region . There they encountered warmer winds which were laden with local dust . When this dust filled cloud pushed towards Mumbai , it was arrested because of the calm winds , deteriorating the city air quality . The fact that continues to be the major pollutant in the city and the visibility of Mumbai residents has been impacted suggests that the major blame for the current worsening of air quality should be ascribed to coarser particles , largely a result of dust emissions . Many development and construction activities are being undertaken across the city these include the coastal corridor , work on the Metro and other digging activities . Unfavourable weather conditions exploit the emissions from such sources to create pollution . Under normal conditions , windblown dust contributes 26 per cent of and 19 per cent in . However , the spike in pollution indicates that levels have gone up significantly . Under normal conditions , the transport sector contributes to 14 per cent of and 31 per cent of . However , the stagnating conditions are likely to have caused a change in this mix . What is the AQI and how does it calculate pollution ? What is PM particulate matter with a diameter of micrometres and PM 10 particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers ?

Key Points to Ponder : What the ongoing story The Armed Forces have narrowed down the final contours of the integrated theatre commands with a proposal for theatre commanders under a national defence committee likely to be headed by the Defence Minister , top officials have told The Indian Express . What are integrated theatre commands ? For Your Information In the simplest words , it is a unified command under which all the resources of the Army , the Navy and the Air Force are pooled , depending on the threat perception . The commands could be geographical like looking at a border with a particular country or thematic , like a command for all maritime threats . Several nations in the world have theatre commands , including the United States and China . The idea of creating an integrated tri Services command in India is not new it had been recommended at various levels after the Kargil conflict . When Gen Rawat was appointed Chief of Defence Staff in January 2020 with a mandate to raise such commands within his three year tenure , the idea was finally brought to the design table . After his appointment , Gen Rawat had commissioned studies within each of the armed forces to come up with ideas of what these commands could look like . These were headed by the Vice Chiefs of the forces . Last year , Gen Rawat had suggested that the first of these commands , the Air Defence Command , could come up by the end of 2020 . However , the process has been delayed due to multiple factors , including the pandemic . Officials are now suggesting that some of the new commands could be rolled out by the end of this year . A model with four to five integrated tri Services theatre commands is under discussion , with each command headed by a three star officer . This officer , the theatre commander , will report to the Chiefs of Staff Committee COSC , which , as the name suggests , includes the three Service chiefs , and is headed by the CDS as its permanent chairman . This brings in a major change the Service chiefs currently have all the operational control over their forces ; operational powers will now move to the COSC . Each of these commands will have the needed assets from all the three forces . Operational control over all of those assets , regardless of the force , will lie with the commander of that theatre .

According to this report , by 2030 , solar and wind will make up almost 51 per cent of total generation capacity up from less than 20 per cent in 2019 and almost 31 per cent of all generated power up from per cent in 2019 . If these projections materialise , they are likely to have major fiscal consequences for states . Research by Sanjay Mitra and me zoom into the regional consequences of this RE build out , and the accompanying expectation of greater RE procurement by state discoms . India massive RE build out so far has largely benefited western and southern states . In August 2023 , per cent of all grid connected RE generation came from eight states . This is largely driven by higher insolation and wind density but also bolstered by favourable state finances and investment environments . Assuming such patterns persist , RE poor , coal rich states are likely to face a double hit to state revenues : Coal royalties as a proportion of overall state revenue will decline as coal growth starts slowing later this decade , and the cost of power procurement will increase as new RE contracts are layered on top of existing commitments for firm power . Grid scale energy storage technologies are still expensive and experimental , and are unlikely to be adopted at a large scale by the end of the decade . Since most coal rich states have limited grid scale RE deployment , they will have to import more power from other states . This means that the quantum of inter state financial transfers for power procurement will shoot up over the next decade . We find that the combined revenue impact of declining coal royalties and increasing electricity imports could worsen budget deficits of RE poor power importing states by almost per cent on average , taking them well beyond the norms established by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act , 2003 .

What is the national curriculum framework ? Why India should be renamed as Bharat in social science textbooks ? What is India , that is , Bharat , shall be a Union of States ? What are the various arguments on Bharat or India ? For Your Information The first debate on Article 1 was to begin on November 17 , 1948 . However , on the suggestion of Govind Ballabh Pant , the discussion on the name was postponed to a later date . On September 17 , 1949 Dr B R Ambedkar presented to the House the final version of the provision , which included both Bharat and India . Several members expressed themselves against the use of India , which they saw as a reminder of the colonial past . Seth Govind Das from Jabalpur preferred to place Bharat over India . A popular demand by several members was also to underline that India was a substitute for Bharat in English language . India , that is , Bharat are not beautiful words for , the name of a country . We should have put the words Bharat known as India also in foreign countries , he said . Hari Vishnu Kamath used the example of the Irish Constitution to argue that the word India was only a translation of Bharat . If honourable colleagues in the House would take the trouble of referring to the Irish Constitution passed in 1937 , they will see that the Irish Free State was one of the few countries in the modern world which changed its name on achieving freedom ; and the fourth article of its Constitution refers to the change in the name of the land , he said . The Constitution of the Irish Free State reads : The name of the State is Eire , or , in the English language , Ireland , Kamath said . Hargovind Pant , who represented the hill districts of the United Provinces , made it clear that the people of Northern India wanted Bharatvarsha and nothing else . Pant argued : So far as the word India is concerned , the Members seem to have , and really I fail to understand why , some attachment for it . We must know that this name was given to our country by foreigners who , having heard of the riches of this land , were tempted towards it and had robbed us of our freedom in order to acquire the wealth of our country .

              " 'Shifting politics make India a hotbed for Israel Hamas war misinformation On October 7 , within hours of the armed group Hamas launching a surprise attack on Israel , social media platforms were rife with support for Israel and also fake news . What stood out in the clamour was the fact that a fair amount of it was produced and distributed by accounts from India . In the days after Israel declared war on Hamas , a blue tick verified handle posted a video on the social media platform X of a Pakistani parliamentarian threatening to obliterate Israel with an atom bomb if it did not end its atrocities against Muslims . That video received more than views . But it was from 2021 and is not related to the current war . Similarly , Suresh Chavhanke , editor in chief of Sudarshan News , a right wing channel , shared a clip on X of an Israeli representative tearing up a 20 page United Nations report documenting human rights violations . That too was from 2021 . Experts say the Israel Hamas war has given a massive reach to social media accounts in India both large and small that have managed to ride a wave of anti Muslim and pro Israel fervour . Apoorvanand , a Delhi University professor who goes by one name , perceives a link between current anti Muslim sentiment and the rise of Hindu nationalist ideologies like Hindutva , particularly under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Hindutva supporters , he said , hold Muslims across countries responsible for all the ills and everything bad . They started looking at Israel as an ideal , as a model to be followed because Israel does what it wants to do to Muslims . A generational shift has taken place in India , said Nicolas Blarel , an associate professor of international relations at Leiden University in the Netherlands . Over the last decade , Blarel has observed that the country has grown more fascinated with Israel , including how it defends itself against attacks from its neighbours . That situation has particular resonance in India , according to Blarel . In addition to border incursions from China in the east , India has also been subject to attacks on its western flank by what it says are state supported armed groups in Pakistan . The two nuclear armed nations have been locked in an ongoing conflict for control of the disputed territory of Kashmir . Those tense international relations have , in part , led Modi Bharatiya Janata Party BJP to seek warmer relations with Israel . Terrorism is the thing that brought the BJP closer to Israel over the last few years how to better deal with counterterrorism , said Blarel . As a result , India political sphere has transformed from an exclusive pro Palestine ecosystem to the complete opposite and to one that is completely empathetic with the Israeli position today , he explained . Changing relationships Indeed , India had supported Palestine right to statehood since 1947 , when it gained independence from the United Kingdom . At the time , the United Nations had proposed a partition plan to create separate Israeli and Palestinian states , something India objected to . The plan never took effect , though . The very next year , Israel declared independence , sparking a conflict that would see the mass displacement of Palestinians . Still , in 1974 , India became the first non Arab country to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organization PLO as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people , continuing its pattern of support . And while New Delhi formally recognised Israel in 1950 , it only normalised diplomatic relations in the early . Even then , it remained committed to the Palestinian cause and continued nurturing its relations with the Muslim majority nations in the Middle East . However , in the past few years , India and Israel have started inching closer . The attacks in India financial capital Mumbai on November 26 , 2008 , helped spur the shift . More than 160 people were killed and over 300 injured . A Jewish centre , the Nariman House , was among the targets : An Israeli American rabbi and his wife were among the six gunned down there . India blamed the attacks on a Pakistan based armed group . Trade and innovation have also drawn the two countries together . When Modi was chief minister of Gujarat , he displayed his fascination for Israeli technologies including drip irrigation and water desalination , both useful for his state . Israel has also been a supplier of arms to India , including during its 1999 skirmish with Pakistan in the Kashmiri region of Kargil . Israeli surveillance drones and mortar shells helped India emerge victorious in that conflict . More recently , India was one of the countries accused of having bought Pegasus spyware from the Israeli cyber intelligence firm NSO Group . Critics accuse the Modi government of deploying the spyware against judges , journalists , activists and political leaders , among others . Experts agree that the biggest shift in India foreign policy towards Israel has happened since Modi came to power in 2014 . He became the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel in 2017 . In the wake of the Hamas attack on October 7 , Modi has issued strong declarations in support of Israel . He initially tweeted , Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families . We stand in solidarity with Israel . In a follow up statement later that day , Modi added that India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations . But neither statement made any reference to the lives or plight of Palestinians . Only five days later did his government address the question of Palestinian relations : In response to a question during a routine media briefing , a spokesperson for the foreign minister said India stance on Palestine had not changed . I was struck by Modi response to express solidarity with Israel and say nothing about Palestine at all , said Michael Kugelman , director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington , DC . Because India policy has been balanced so far . The statements showed total support for Israel to defend itself , according to Ashok Swain , head of the department of peace and conflict research at Uppsala University in Sweden . While New Delhi is now trying to maintain a more balanced position , those early statements showed that Modi is more interested in getting votes and appealing to his right wing constituency , Swain added . They send the message that Muslims are the perpetrators of all sorts of crimes and less than human beings . They do talk about the Gaza situation or even who created Hamas . Swain also sees the statements as a demonstration of the common ground Modi shares with far right politicians in Israel . Hindu nationalists and Zionists have an ideological similarity : They want a strong state and a strong leader , he explained . They also have a common factor Islamophobia which also binds them together . Support ratio of Those tensions played out on social media in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of the Israel Hamas war . At Al Jazeera request , the Narrative Research Lab in New Delhi scanned through trending hashtags and phrases in India on the social media platform X , to better understand how political narratives about the war were being shaped . The phrase We Indians stood out partially because of the ongoing Cricket World Cup but also because of the conflict , said Sarabjot Singh , the lab co founder . We Indians is an expression often invoked to stir nationalist pride . Using it as a keyword , Singh co founder Sundeep Narwani used artificial intelligence to analyse a total of tweets , of which included words about the Israel Hamas war . More than were pro Israel , and approximately 250 were pro Palestine , indicating a five to one ratio in favour of Israel . In an attempt to gauge social media chatter , the lab also analysed two hashtags : IstandwithIsrael and IsraelPalestineWar . The former was used globally , but the lab found a substantial number of Indian accounts using it . Issues that bring Modi and Netanyahu together are the same issues that make the Hindutva constituency in India gravitate towards Israel admiring how Netanyahu has negotiated the neighbourhood with a strong stance , said Kugelman .',\n",
              " 'Israel Laws of War As Israel begins the first stages of Operation Swords of Iron in response to Hamas October 7 terrorist attacks , many questions have been raised about the moral and legal aspects of the war . In Gaza , units of the Israel Defense Forces will confront tens of thousands of heavily armed Hamas fighters deeply embedded in a large noncombatant population . Given this highly challenging setting , a core concern is how the IDF can effectively protect Israel , its citizens , and Israel own soldiers while adhering to moral principles , military ethical norms , and international law . Some have argued that Israel is not adhering to international laws of war . They assert that , in seeking to destroy Hamas military and political infrastructure , Israeli forces have disregarded the civilian populations in Gaza and are causing excessive collateral damage . In such a difficult war environment , some collateral damage is , unfortunately , unavoidable . But it is crucial to understand that Israel has a legal , moral , and ethical framework for approaching questions about conduct in war . This approach derives from basic principles of Israeli law , namely the obligation to respect and protect human dignity , international laws of war , and the IDF Code of Ethics , which has guided the conduct of Israeli commanders over the past three decades . By setting down distinct parameters within which Israeli forces must operate after the war as well as during it Israeli war doctrine has significant implications for the operation against Hamas . Indeed , contrary to what some international commentators have claimed , Israel military response to the attacks so far has followed these standards , and the IDF has taken multiple steps to minimize collateral damage . Although the following should not be taken as the formal position of the Israeli government in the current crisis , it is an attempt to shed light on the major issues and the general way that Israel views them . A DIFFERENT KIND OF CONFLICT On October 7 , 2023 , the last day of the annual Jewish high holidays , hundreds of Hamas fighters , along with members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad , a smaller terrorist organization , invaded Israel , attacked more than 20 villages and towns , as well as IDF military bases , and committed horrendous atrocities . More than noncombatants were brutally massacred , and some 220 Israelis even babies and sick and elderly people were abducted and taken hostage in Gaza . In addition , Hamas launched thousands of rockets at Israel , including at densely populated civilian areas in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem . There is not a shred of doubt that these blatant acts of aggression fit the legal criteria of war crimes . Given the stated goal of destroying Israel , set forth in Hamas charter , it should come as no surprise that some observers have described the attacks as having genocidal intent . In view of demonstrations in some Western cities and statements in the Western media calling for an immediate cease fire , the nature of Hamas needs to be made clear . Hamas is a Palestinian militia that governs the Gaza Strip , between Israel and Egypt . Much of the West , including Australia , Canada , Japan , the United Kingdom , the United States , and the European Union , have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization . This designation is based on the methods Hamas employs in pursuit of its goals . Some may regard those goals as justified , and others as immoral and unjustifiable , but those assessments are not relevant to the terrorist designation . Only the group methods count . Historical parallels do not adequately fit the present situation . In the days since the attacks , many have searched for historical parallels to try to make sense of the fathomless violence . Because Israel has witnessed no comparable act of terrorism in its 75 year history , some have looked back further in time or have tried to set aside the terrorist or anti Semitic aspects of the attacks , viewing them instead as an extreme case of military aggression . Hence , commentators have variously invoked the anti Jewish pogroms of eastern Europe more than a century ago , the Holocaust , and the surprise attack that began the 1973 Yom Kippur War . Such parallels , however , do not adequately fit the present situation . The pogroms and the Holocaust took place at a time when Jews did not have their own nation state , and the Yom Kippur War was launched by a state military rather than by a terrorist militia . The distinction between combatants and noncombatants , which can be easily maintained when a national military such as Egypt fights against Israel , is not maintained when a terrorist militia tries to use urban populations as a human shield . To understand the specific values and ethical norms that apply in Israeli actions against Hamas , then , these historical comparisons must be discarded . The opening phase of Operation Swords of Iron is now unfolding . Israel war cabinet , which now consists of some government ministers and several opposition leaders , including some with significant military experience , has set and made public the broad goals of the war . The government has not offered many details about the kinds of force to be used , except for the high number of reservists well over who have been ordered to serve in a variety of military units . Nonetheless , it is possible to assess Israel overall approach by examining the general principles that will govern its conduct . A DUTY TO FIGHT The state of Israel , including its courts and military commanders , has , over the course of its history , based military conduct on several kinds of values and ensuing norms . Some values stem from Israel status as a democratic country and as the nation state of the Jewish people . The values of the IDF are expressed in its code of ethics . And some values come from international law , as interpreted by the Israeli legal system , led by the Supreme Court of Israel . Although these values derive from different moral , ethical , and legal sources , they combine to form two important general principles in the Israeli approach to combat operations . The first principle is that any action taken on behalf of the Israeli state , including by its military and security forces , must be compatible with the universal obligation to respect and protect human dignity . A simple example is the requirement to treat captured enemy combatants humanely in accordance with the Geneva Conventions . This principle thus provides a moral , ethical , and legal constraint on military conduct . The second principle , which can be called the self defense principle , has two parts . First , it encompasses the right to self defense if the state or any of its inhabitants is subject to armed attack ; second , it provides that the state has a duty to defend its citizens when they are under direct attack . Israel has a duty to defend its citizens against potential future attacks . Indeed , Israel and other countries have interpreted the duty to defend citizens enshrined in the second part of this principle to hold not only for current or imminent attacks , but also for potential future attacks , even if they are not expected soon . The time for a state to create means of defense is not when its citizens already face danger , but much earlier an imperative generally recognized by governments everywhere . In turn , how this defense is carried out when the danger is neither present nor imminent depends on the nature of the future danger . The Hamas attacks have triggered both parts of the self defense principle . Israel military operation in Gaza stems from what it views as the state right to take necessary action to defend itself and its inhabitants , and its duty to protect the latter against not only the present attack but also continuing threats from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad . Secretary of State Antony Blinken underscored this point during his visit to Tel Aviv on October 16 , when he said , Israel has the right and indeed the duty to defend its people from Hamas and other terrorists and to prevent future attacks . Thus , the answer to the why question of Israel military response is now clear : to satisfy the self defense principle , Israel needs to go beyond the reestablishment of security on its border with Gaza and eliminate the possibility of any future such attacks . But the how question how Israeli forces will carry out this task is more difficult . Israel war cabinet has instructed the IDF to destroy the military and governmental abilities of Hamas in Gaza . But what does that mean in practice ? PREVENTIVE ACTION To understand the major goal the IDF has set for Operation Swords of Iron according to Israeli principles of war , it is necessary to distinguish between two kinds of self defense . Examples of the first kind are familiar since we encounter them in ordinary , everyday circumstances . Say , for example , you are crossing a park , and someone approaches you and tries to snatch your wallet . You forcefully resist the person , who then runs away . In this case , the structure of the encounter is clear : the would be thief created a problem , you used some force , and the problem was solved . A military attack , however , often takes on a different cast . The use of defensive force may stop the attack , thus ending the immediate danger , but the problem has not been fully solved . The unit that launched the attack may have pulled back , but it can regroup and launch another one later . Under such a continuing threat , self defense must have a wider scope . In the event of a terrorist attack sponsored by a de facto governing authority , as was the case with Hamas murderous rampage , the attacked state may need to broaden that scope further . The Israeli war cabinet has instructed the IDF to dismantle both the military and the governmental capabilities of Hamas . In taking on such a goal , Israel is performing self defense in a broader sense . The problem Israel faces now is continued exposure to a terrorist threat . Hamas attack on Israel and its citizens clearly shows the gravity of this danger : it will persist as long as Hamas organization in Gaza , run by Yahya Sinwar , is extant . Thus , Israel has concluded that the only viable solution to the problem is the complete elimination of Hamas political and military wings . Israeli soldiers training for urban warfare , Golan Heights , October 2023 Gil Eliyahu Reuters The spokesperson for the IDF has explained the general goals of this eradication operation . In its attack on Israel , Hamas killed more than Israeli citizens , injured more than , and abducted some 220 of them , including numerous foreign nationals ; every building or site that Hamas used in those attacks , or in support of those attacks , must be destroyed . In other words , Hamas facilities that ostensibly serve other governmental functions in Gaza may be assumed to provide infrastructure for planning and launching future attacks . Effectively solving the Hamas problem therefore includes the eradication of its political offices as well . The IDF spokesperson has also stated that every member of Hamas who was involved in planning or carrying out the October 7 attack must be killed . Israel Supreme Court assessed the legality of targeted killing operations in a 2006 decision , which in turn was based on international law considerations , as well as the ethical doctrine developed within the framework of the IDF . I am one of the doctrine co authors . The court found targeted killing to be lawful under certain strict conditions , including considerations of proportionality . In the case of the October 7 attacks , however , more than perpetrators managed to escape back into Gaza , and an Israeli operation aimed at eliminating all of them , or even many of them , in targeted killing missions is impractical , given the strict requirement to avoid or minimize collateral damage set by the Israeli Supreme Court , the IDF Code of Ethics , and the basic Israeli principle to protect human dignity . Given this reality , the IDF declared intent to kill all perpetrators means in practice that it will pursue the leading figures , because they continue to pose grave danger to Israel and its citizens . All other perpetrators will be designated as threats , as well , based on their affiliation with Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad and their participation in the attacks . They will not enjoy a life of tranquility . But Israel may need to address the danger they pose to its citizens later , not necessarily during the present war . Strictly speaking , the goal of the present operation is to destroy Hamas ability to launch military attacks against Israel and its ability to control Gaza ; the goal is not to kill every member of Hamas . SELF DEFENSE , NOT REVENGE Israel operation in Gaza should not be depicted as , or justified on the grounds of , revenge . No principle of an eye for an eye should guide Israel pursuit of Hamas and its members . The major principle at issue , according to Israel own conception of war conduct , is self defense . In particular , the civilian population of Gaza should not be subject to acts of revenge , which are clearly immoral and , as a form of collective punishment , also illegal . Nonetheless , a large scale operation to dismantle the terrorist organization that controls Gaza is bound to involve numerous interactions with inhabitants who are not involved in the hostilities . Such interactions must be guided by three principles , the first of which also underlies the second and third . The first is that the IDF must continually try to minimize collateral damage . Obviously , this imperative applies to the Israeli population as well , but in the present operation , its primary application concerns the issue of collateral damage in the Gaza Strip , and the obligation to protect the life , health , and property of noncombatants who live there under Hamas control . Here , two further principles come into play : the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality . Both are well established as components of historical just war doctrine jus ad bellum and , since the twentieth century , have been inscribed in international law , as well . One way the IDF has long sought to minimize collateral harm is by warning civilians of imminent military attacks . In previous operations in Gaza , for example , the IDF alerted inhabitants to evacuate areas by employing knocking on the roof warnings shortly before it attacked : with this method and others , including phone calls , inhabitants would be given multiple warnings of an attack , the more the better . But under the present circumstances , this approach is no longer possible , given the scale of the operation and the number of Hamas targets involved . IDF units must continue to try to prevent harm to noncombatants who have not evacuated . Instead , on October 13 , the IDF issued a general order to noncombatant inhabitants who live in the northern part of Gaza to move to the southern part , since the next stage of hostilities will take place in the north . Such a large scale evacuation is required because Hamas has embedded itself and its operations in residential areas , and it would be impossible for the IDF to act effectively , systematically , and forcefully against Hamas without harming noncombatants there . In this situation , the general evacuation order can serve the purpose of the roof knocking warnings . Given the magnitude of Hamas October 7 attacks and Israel clear announcement that it is compelled to make a devastating military response , it is reasonable to assume that all inhabitants of Gaza are aware of the situation . In addition to Israeli and international media , Palestinian radio and TV stations have extensively covered these events . Often the IDF breaks into their programs to warn the population . Residents thus understand the need to evacuate . Nonetheless , the IDF has followed the evacuation order with other forms of warning . Moreover , the IDF guidelines require that its forces must distinguish between terrorist combatants and noncombatants who have not yet evacuated . Israeli units must continue to try to prevent harm to the latter . By and large , the presence of such noncombatants should be known to the IDF and , to the extent possible , should be taken into account when it plans and carries out military activity . THE DAMAGE THRESHHOLD Which brings us to the principle of proportionality . Since it is Hamas policy to blur all distinctions between its members and the general population of Gaza , an Israeli attack on a Hamas military target often risks causing collateral damage , even when extensive precautions are taken . The international press and Western commentators often assume that if any noncombatants are killed in such operations , then excessive force has been used . That assumption is flawed . Of course , all noncombatant casualties are regrettable , and every effort should be made to minimize them . According to the principle of proportionality as elaborated in just war doctrine , however , the crucial issue is whether the value of the military advantage gained is greater than the cost of the expected collateral damage . If it is , then the act in question can be justified . This holds important implications for the present war against Hamas . Israel must seek to minimize collateral damage as much as is reasonably possible . But according to Israel own self defense principle , given the kind of threat that Hamas poses and given Israel resulting need to eliminate the political and military infrastructure of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad it is necessary to establish a clear limit for collateral damage . How should this determination be made ? Such proportionality considerations can be complicated , but the IDF has used a specific process for making them for the past three decades . Finding the correct balance involves deep and intricate moral , ethical , and legal analysis . To grasp the underlying principles that determine what level of collateral damage is acceptable , it is useful to first consider extreme cases . Take , for example , an enemy site that is being used to prepare an imminent attack that would kill hundreds of people . Destroying the site would likely cause the death of a few noncombatants who are not involved in terror activities , but any reasonable analysis would conclude that the destruction of the site is warranted . For an example on the other extreme , consider a situation in which defense forces are targeting a facility containing enemy rockets that are not being used in a current attack but could be used in the future . Let say a pilot approaches the site to destroy it but sees a bus , full of children , in the vicinity . Since there is no urgent need to destroy the magazine and the mission can be carried out later , it is clear that the strike should be called off . An IDF soldier near Israel border with Lebanon , October 2023 Lisi Niesner Reuters To acquire a fuller understanding of how proportionality is calculated , however , it is necessary to move from these clear cut cases at each extreme toward the center , where enlarging the military advantage of a given action may also require greater collateral damage . There is no quantitative formula for making such determinations . But qualitative considerations are critical , including the extent and immediacy of the threat that is being acted against and the orders of magnitude of potential casualties if that threat is carried out , as well as the expected collateral damage if the threat is neutralized . It is also important to stress that the IDF does not base its determination of the legitimacy of a given action solely on proportionality considerations . According to Israeli principles of conduct , the IDF is obliged to minimize collateral damage , even if causing such damage is permissible under the principle of proportionality . Hence , the IDF aborts a large percentage of its sorties because it determines that it can cause less collateral damage by carrying out the mission under different circumstances . Finally , bringing troops back home is an advantage that should never be disregarded or undervalued in proportionality considerations . The principle of upholding human dignity must also apply to people in military uniform . According to Israeli doctrine , part of the military advantage of a given action must include the extent to which that action minimizes IDF casualties . RULES AFTER ENGAGEMENT Much discussion has centered on how Israel should treat the population of Gaza in relation to the major goal of eradicating Hamas . Immediately following the attack , the Israeli government announced that it was cutting off electricity , water , food , and fuel to Gaza . It is true that the enemy can use fuel and electricity for both civil and military purposes , but cutting off food and water is wrong , because it is incompatible with established ethical principles . Adding to the complexity of the operation is the issue of the more than 200 people that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad abducted and took to Gaza . This problem demands further analysis of its own , but it is worth underscoring the prime importance of securing the release of these hostages , both on ethical and political military grounds . Another key aspect of the conduct of Israel war against Hamas has been largely neglected . When Hamas is destroyed and Palestinian Islamic Jihad is eliminated , what then ? Israeli reoccupation or annexation of Gaza is utterly unacceptable . In its advanced versions , just war doctrine includes norms and principles governing conduct not only during war but also once the fighting ends , under what is known as jus post bellum . According to the latter principles , reoccupation or annexation of Gaza by Israel is utterly unacceptable . Instead , what needs to take place is restoring security in the areas of Israel adjacent to Gaza ; and then establishing peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians based on some agreement with respect to temporary borders . Any policies that involve population transfer , long term occupation , or bringing the territory directly under Israeli rule would be incompatible with either of these goals . To build a new peace in Gaza , creative alternatives must be sought , perhaps even some first steps toward a solution of the wider Israeli Palestinian conflict . In the near term , the only plausible option would be the introduction of some multinational military and governmental authority , international or regional , which could be created by a UN Security Council resolution and that would act in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority and in coordination with Israel . Whatever arrangements are made , they should not be taken as an ultimate solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict . The spirit of the two state solution will need to be revived and allowed to prevail , through the introduction and implementation of confidence building measures over a longer timeline . But the full elimination of the terrorist threat from Hamas and affiliated groups could do much to set this process in motion . Policies of pursuing lasting peace , all the more so policies in the spirit of the two state solution , must rest on the practical assumption that the dangers to Israel and its citizens , as nurtured and practiced by terrorist organizations , have been permanently eliminated .',\n",
              " 'All the terms you need to know about the Palestine Israel crisis Here is a list of words that can help you understand the news stories emerging out of the region better . Listen to article The Middle East is on fire again . After Hamas launched a surprise offensive on October 7 , resulting in the loss of Israeli lives , Israel carried out withering air raids on Gaza that have displaced hundreds of thousands , killed over Palestinians and left scores more wounded . Israel has implemented a total siege on the Gaza Strip , severely impacting the lives of million residents by cutting off their access to essential resources , including food , water , and fuel . Amid this unprecedented development , readers are besieged by a flow of information full of words and terminologies often mentioned in the context of Israel and Palestine that they may not be familiar with . has compiled a list of words that can help you understand the news stories coming out of Palestine and Israel . This list is in alphabetical order . Antisemitism While addressing the nation from the Oval Office last week , US President Joe Biden urged Americans to fight both Islamophobia and antisemitism , without equivocation . We ca stand by and stand silent when this happens . We must without equivocation denounce antisemitism . We must also without equivocation denounce Islamophobia , he declared . Antisemitism is a certain perception of the followers of the Judaism religion or Jews , which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews . Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non Jewish individuals their property , toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities . Apartheid Last week , in a post on their X account , Iran mission to the United Nations warned that if Israeli apartheid war crimes and genocide are not stopped then the situation could spiral out of control with far reaching consequences . The apartheid refers to a policy or system of segregation or discrimination . In the case of South Africa , it was the racial segregation under the all white government of South Africa which dictated that non white South Africans a majority of the population were required to live in separate areas from whites and use separate public facilities , and contact between the two groups would be limited . The different racial groups were physically separated according to their location , public facilities and social life . Balfour Declaraion The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 expressing support for the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine , that was then part of the Ottoman Empire . The declaration was named after Arthur Balfour , the British Foreign Secretary at the time . Palestinians argue that the declaration disregarded the rights and aspirations of the Arab population living in Palestine at the time . It remains a controversial document that played a pivotal role in the creation of the Israeli state in 1948 . Esteemed Palestinian American scholar Edward Said stressed that the declaration was made by a European power about a non European territory in a flat disregard of both the presences and the wishes of the native majority resident in that territory , and it took the form of a promise about this same territory to another foreign group , that this foreign group might , quite literally , make this territory a national home for the Jewish people . Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions BDS The Boycott , Divestment , Sanctions BDS is a Palestinian civil society movement that aims to end international support for Israel oppression of Palestinians . Taking inspiration from the South African anti apartheid struggle , the BDS initiative hopes to exert pressure on Israel , encouraging its adherence to international laws . Boycotts encompass the withdrawal of support from Israel regime , complicit Israeli institutions and international companies engaged in actions that violate Palestinian human rights . Divestment campaigns seek the disinvestment of funds from Israel and companies that contribute to Israeli apartheid . Sanctions campaigns aim to compel governments by banning business with illegal Israeli settlements , ending military and free trade agreements and suspending Israel membership in international forums such as UN bodies and FIFA . In the UK , an anti BDS bill is being proposed that is designed to stop councils and other public authorities from conducting boycotts , divestment and sanctions campaigns against Israel . Colonialism Colonialism is a practice of domination , which involves the subjugation of one people to another and is frequently used to describe the settlement of North America , Australia , New Zealand , Africa , India and Brazil , places that were controlled by a large population of permanent European residents . The term colony comes from the Latin word colonus , meaning farmer which tells us that the practice of colonialism usually involved the transfer of population to a new territory , where the arrivals lived as permanent settlers while maintaining political allegiance to their country of origin . Ethnic cleansing Israel has already carried out mass ethnic cleansing of Palestinians under the fog of war , Francesca Albanese , the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Palestine has warned . Again , in the name of self defence , Israel is seeking to justify what would amount to ethnic cleansing , she said . Ethnic cleansing is a well defined policy of a particular group of persons to systematically eliminate another group from a given territory on the basis of religious , ethnic or national origin . Such a policy involves violence and is very often connected with military operations . Gaza Strip Gaza is a coastal strip of land that lies on ancient trading and maritime routes along the Mediterranean shore . Held by the Ottoman Empire until 1917 , it passed from British to Egyptian to Israeli military rule over the last century and is now a fenced in enclave inhabited by over 2 m Palestinians . Genocide Earlier this month , caretaker Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani slammed Israel for committing a genocide against Palestinians . Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of the United Nations defines genocide as : any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such : killing members of the group ; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ; and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . Golan Heights The Golan Heights is a rocky plateau in south western Syria , about 60 km 40 miles southwest of Damascus and covers about sq km . It has a political and strategic significance which belies its size . Courtesy Wikipedia . Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the closing stages of the 1967 Six Day War . Most of the Syrian Arab inhabitants fled the area during the conflict . Israel 1981 annexation was not globally recognised and Syria demands the return of its territory . The area became a point of contention once again when Israeli strikes reportedly killed two people near the Syrian town of Beit Jinn in Israeli occupied Golan Heights recently . Great March of Return Between March 2018 and December 2019 , Palestinians in the Gaza Strip held the Great March of Return GMR demonstrations , demanding the right of Palestinian refugees to their villages and towns in what is now Israel and the cessation of the Israeli blockade . These demonstrations involved thousands of participants who would gather every Friday and on specific occasions at five designated points along the border fence . Additionally , smaller protests occurred during the week at the beach and at various locations near the fence at night . The UN says that about m people have been displaced in Gaza in the current conflict which is over 60 per cent of the entire strip population . According to Article 13 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights , everyone has the right to return to his country . Hebron Protocol The Hebron Protocol was an agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation PLO signed in 1997 . It aimed to address security and administrative arrangements in the city of Hebron , located in the West Bank . The protocol divided Hebron into two areas : , which was placed under Palestinian Authority control , and , which remained under Israeli military control . English language website The New Arab describes Hebron city in the West Bank as a microcosm of Israel occupation . Holocaust Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told US Presiden Joe Biden that Hamas atrocities on Oct 7 were the worst since the Holocaust . The Holocaust was the systematic , state sponsored persecution and murder of six million European Jews by the Nazi German regime and its allies and collaborators . The Holocaust was an evolving process that took place throughout Europe between 1933 and 1945 . Intifada The Arabic term intifada , literally means shaking off , when applied to conflicts usually takes on the meaning of an uprising , popular resistance , or rebellion The first Intifada began in December 1987 after a traffic accident in which an Israeli truck crashed into a vehicle carrying Palestinian workers in Gaza Jabalya refugee camp , killing four . Stone throwing protests , strikes and shutdowns followed . It ended with the Madrid Conference in 1991 , although some date its formal termination as 1993 with the onset of the Oslo Accords . At least Palestinians and 400 Israelis were killed in the violence .

Reuters The second or al Aqsa Intifada began in 2000 , and , while many of its actions and effects are still playing out today , most authorities assign an end date of July 2005 . At least Palestinians and Israelis were killed in the ensuing violence . Palestinian police exchange fire with Israeli soldiers during clashes near Netzreem Jewish settlement in Gaza Strip , October 2000 . Reuters A recent Dawn report said that Palestinian deaths from the Israeli siege of Gaza are the most that Palestine has ever witnessed , exceeding the first and second intifada combined . Iron Dome On Oct 24 , a senior defence official announced that the Pentagon is increasing its support for Israel by supplying them with complete Iron Dome air defence systems . Via IDF The Iron Dome is a part of Israel defence system . It is designed to shoot down incoming rockets . Developed between 2007 and 2011 , the dome has a success rate of , according to the IDF . Islamophobia Islamophobia is an extreme fear of and hostility toward Islam and Muslims which often leads to hate speech , hate crimes , as well as social and political discrimination . According to Georgetown University Bridge Initiative , a multi year it can be used to rationalise policies such as mass surveillance , incarceration , and disenfranchisement , and can influence domestic and foreign policy . Islamophobia was originally developed as a concept in the late by political activists to draw attention to rhetoric and actions directed at Islam and Muslims in Western liberal democracies . The UN observes March 15 as the international day to combat Islamophobia . Israel Defence Forces IDF The Israel Defence Forces IDF serves as the primary military organisation of the State of Israel . It comprises three distinct branches : the Israeli Ground Forces , the Israeli Air Force , and the Israeli Navy . It has said it would intensify strikes on Gaza ahead of a planned ground invasion , as UN agencies warned of a catastrophic humanitarian situation in the blockaded territory . Kibbutz On Oct 7 , Hamas fighters attacked a music festival which was held in a field outside the kibbutz , about km from the wall separating Gaza and southern Israel . A kibbutz plural : kibbutzim is a communal settlement in Israel that is owned and shared equally by the people who live there and run it . The first kibbutz was founded in 1909 ; currently , there are about 270 , with a total population exceeding . Adults live in private quarters , while children are generally housed and cared for as a group . Nakba The mass evacuation of Palestinians has given Gazans memories of the Nakba . The Nakba , or catastrophe , refers to the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during the Arab Israeli war of 1948 , which has been likened to the ethnic cleansing of Palestine and the near total destruction of Palestinian society . The creation of Israel entailed the forced expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homeland to establish a Jewish majority state . Arab villagers fleeing from an unidentified area in the Galilee in October Between 1947 and 1949 , at least Palestinians from a m population were made refugees beyond the borders of the state . Naksa Al Naksa or the Naksa , also known as the day of defeat or setback , is observed by Palestinians on June 5 each year . Similar to Nakba , it commemorates the displacement of Palestinians that occurred during the Six Day War in 1967 , which resulted in Israel occupation of the rest of historically Palestinian areas of the West Bank , East Jerusalem , the Gaza Strip as well as the Syrian Golan Heights and Egyptian Sinai Peninsula . Destroyed Egyptian armour lines the sides of a Sinai road after it was hit by Israeli jet fighters during the 1967 Six Day Neocolonialism Neocolonialism is a process by which former colonising countries exploit the rules and regulations of their former colonies that are now independent , underdeveloped or less developing , for indirect domination . Predominantly neocolonialism has been noticed in economics , although this economic exploitation is intertwined with political and cultural exploitation . Oslo Accords Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organisation PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat on 13 September 1993 , redrew the geopolitical map of the entire region when they signed the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self Governing Arrangements DOP for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho , marking one of the most momentous events in the twentieth century history of the Middle East . The DOP was signed in Washington , with President Bill Clinton acting as master of ceremonies , but it had been negotiated in Oslo and initiated there in late August . The first part was mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO . The second part , the Declaration of Principles , set an agenda for negotiations on Palestinian self government in the occupied territories , beginning with Gaza and Jericho . Thirty years later , the goals of these accords remain unachieved . Palestine Liberation Organisation PLO There are currently two governments in control of the Palestine territories . Palestine Liberation Organisation governs the West Bank region whereas Hamas is in control of Gaza . The PLO , established in 1964 as a coalition of resistance groups , political parties , and various Palestinian civil society organisations , achieved global recognition as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people by the . The PLO had agreed to end its policy of armed resistance and , as a result , the PLO presence and government were recognised by the international community . During the 1996 elections , the electorate handed the PLO a landslide victory and the mandate to rule the West Bank and Gaza . However , the 2007 armed conflict between PLO and Hamas in Gaza led to the ouster of the PLO from Gaza . Rafah crossing The Rafah crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt Sinai region is the sole route for aid to enter Gaza directly from outside Israel and the only exit that does not lead to Israeli territory . The crossing is controlled by Egypt . It has become a focus in the intensifying conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas , as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have headed towards south Gaza after Israel warned them to leave Gaza City and the enclave north . The only likely route for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza is via Rafah from Egypt Sinai region . It is also the only exit point for Gaza residents seeking to flee . Egypt is wary of insecurity near the border with Gaza in northeastern Sinai , where it faced an insurgency that peaked after 2013 and has now largely been suppressed . Settler colonialism Israel occupation is illegal and indistinguishable from a settler colonial situation , which must end , as a pre condition for Palestinians to exercise their right to self determination , the UN independent expert on the occupied Palestinian territory told the UN General Assembly last year . Settler colonialism is an ongoing system of power that perpetuates the genocide and repression of indigenous peoples and cultures . Essentially hegemonic in scope , settler colonialism normalises the continuous settler occupation , exploiting lands and resources to which indigenous peoples have genealogical relationships . Settler colonialism includes interlocking forms of oppression , including racism , white supremacy , heteropatriarchy , and capitalism . Shebaa Farms The Shebaa Farms is a disputed region between Lebanon and Israel situated near the Hermon mountain range at the Lebanon Syria border . The Shebaa Farms were seized by Israel during the 1967 Middle East conflict and are a part of Israeli occupied Golan Heights . Syria and Lebanon , on the other hand , claim that it belongs to Lebanon territory . There have been conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon at their border . The latter launched rockets at three Israeli outposts in Shebaa Farms and in retaliation , the former hit a Hezbollah outpost in Lebanon . Two state solution The two state solution is an agreement that would create a state for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip alongside Israel . It would see an independent Palestinian state established alongside the existing one of Israel giving both people their own territory . It is the official position of the UK , US , United Nations and even Israel itself but many now say there is little hope of achieving it . West Bank The landlocked West Bank the larger of the two Palestinian territories is home to some three million Palestinians . Courtesy Wikipedia Inhabited since at least the century BC , the West Bank , like the Gaza Strip , has been dominated by many different powers throughout its history . Zionism Zionism is a nationalist movement calling for the establishment of an independent state for the Jewish people in its ancient homeland of Zion . I do believe you have to be a Jew to be a Zionist , and I am a Zionist , said Joe Biden when he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet during his visit to Israel . Zion is a place name often synonymous with Jerusalem in the Hebrew Bible . Anti Zionism is the belief that a Jewish state should not exist .',\n",

They also suggested that the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia might have influenced Hamas to carry out those attacks .

Earlier , in a joint press conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese , President Biden mentioned that his evaluation is grounded in his instincts and does rely on substantial evidence .

The strikes were carried out in retaliation for a series of assaults against US forces in both Iraq and Syria . Israel Gaza War Updates LIVE The US strikes reflect the Joe Biden administration determination to maintain a delicate balance , as per AP . In an effort to prevent further aggression , which might be sparked by Israel fight against Hamas , the United States wants to take maximum action against Iranian backed organisations that it believes are aiming at the country . At the same time , it wants to avoid escalating the situation and starting a larger conflict , AP added . Information about the specific targets and other details were not yet provided .

Pat Ryder , two of those assaults that targeted al Tanf Garrison in Syria and al Asad Airbase in Iraq using drones resulted in the injuries of 21 US servicemen . In a statement , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the precision self defence strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against US personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups that began on October 17 . \" He said President Joe Biden directed the narrowly tailored strikes to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself , its personnel , and its interests . \" He added that the operation was separate and distinct from Israel war against Hamas . The Biden administration has stated that it appears Tehran was unaware of the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 . It has not accused Tehran of playing a direct part in it . The US appears to be worried that Iran and its allies could escalate the dispute into a larger war , despite the fact that Iran has historically backed Hamas . As per Austin , the US does not seek a broader conflict , but if Iranian proxy groups continue , the US wo hesitate to take additional action to protect its forces . According to the Pentagon , all the US personnel hurt in the militant attacks received minor injuries and all returned to duty . In addition , a contractor suffered a cardiac arrest and died while seeking shelter from a possible drone attack . The US , including the Pentagon , has repeatedly said any strike response by America would be directly tied to the attacks on the troops , and not connected to the war between Israel and Hamas .

Advertisement The clips show the agility of these well trained Hamas fighters , their discipline , the weight of weaponry they carry , their automatic weapons , grenades and anti tank launchers . \" In order to be invisible , they began destroying the surveillance cameras on top of the army watchtowers as well as the remotely controlled machineguns with the help of explosives dropped by drones , or using automatic rifles , \" military spokesman Colonel Peter Lerner told AFP . At this stage , \" they opened 20 breaches in the security fence with the help of explosives placed against the barbed wire or concrete blocks \" of the Gaza border , which is how the barrier is constructed , notably around the Erez crossing used by workers to enter Israel . In breaching the fence , the militants blow apart the long held myth that Israel was akin to an impregnable fortress . Hamas actively targets the Israeli army communication systems to prevent reinforcements from being alerted , also hitting an electricity pylon near kibbutz Beeri . At the same time , they use speedboats to try and bypass Israel high tech naval smart fence . \" They did succeed , \" says Lerner . Everything happens very quickly , with groups of militants crossing through the damaged fence into Israel on motorbikes , in pick up trucks or on foot , in places accompanied by bulldozers to clear the way if needed . Fanning out , they head for nearby Israeli towns and kibbutzim , most of which are between one and seven kilometres up to four miles from the border fence . Given how quickly they spread out , it appears that each knows exactly where he is going . Unprecedented carnage As the sun rises , the carnage begins . From am , the militants start forcing their way into several farming communities and also storm a rave where hundreds of young people had been dancing all night on the last day of the Jewish festival of Sukkot . Surveillance camera footage , subsequently made public , shows the militants calmly walking through the green pathways of Beeri and other kibbutzim such as Kfar Aza , Nir Yitzhak , Nir Oz and Nirim . Hamas says of its \" fighters \" attacked 50 different sites on that Saturday , the Jewish sabbath , a day Israelis now call \" Black Shabbat \" . Israel says 25 farming communities and towns near the Gaza border were methodically attacked , among them Sderot , Ofakim and Netivot . The attacks involved a level of violence unprecedented in both its nature and scale , with the militants going house to house and slaughtering more than people , the vast majority of them civilians who died on the first day . Babies , children , teenagers , elderly people and entire families were shot dead , stabbed with knives or mutilated with axes , survivors have said . Their accounts are backed up by testimonies from first responders , soldiers and volunteers from Zaka , who recover human remains in accordance with Jewish religious law to afford them a proper burial . Armed residents who served as guards on the kibbutzim tried to keep the attackers at bay , waiting long hours for the army whose troops eventually arrived on foot after deadly clashes with militants and were able to retake areas where terrified residents had been trapped . The most shocking images emerged from cameras worn by the militants who filmed their atrocities , with more than 40 minutes of raw footage pieced together and shown to the international media . The image of bodies awaiting identification at Israel forensic institute in Tel Aviv , where AFP was able to enter , was atrocious , with many horrifically mutilated or burnt beyond recognition . Visiting reporters were shown hundreds of bodies , the vast majority civilians and among them many youngsters , by institute director Hen Kugel , who was reduced to tears , saying he had \" never seen such barbarity , such cruelty \" . At one point he showed reporters a tangle of bones and shreds of flesh held together by an electrical cable caked in molten plastic . \" On the scanner , we clearly see two spinal columns , that of a man or woman and that of a child . The posture of the two bodies shows the adult tried to protect the child . They were tied up then burned alive . \" Speaking to AFP , a young French Israeli Zaka volunteer called Tomer , who did not want to give his surname , said : \" Children were tied up together several metres feet from their parents who were also bound , before being burnt alive in their homes . \" Some were shot at close range . Whole families were wiped out like that . \" In Kfar Aza , the charred remains were found of a young couple huddled together with their three children . \" Young girls were raped , babies had their throats slit . But I am not giving any more details , \" Lerner told AFP . \" The forensic experts have recorded everything . These are atrocities . \" A nation with PTSD By am , Hamas militants have stormed six military bases : at Erez in the north , Nahal Oz opposite Gaza City , two others by Beeri kibbutz and Reim across the fence from central Gaza , and two in the south : in Sufa and near kibbutz Kerem Shalom close to the Egyptian border . The images released by Hamas show militants firing on soldiers and also kidnapping several , some of whom are wearing only underwear . They also picture themselves alongside the bodies of dead soldiers , while other bodies are driven away in a white jeep . At the Supernova music festival , which was taking place in a field several kilometres miles from the border with central Gaza , militants reach the site using motorised paragliders and also in pickup trucks . Young ravers initially film them on their smartphones , their curiosity quickly turning to panic as the gunfire starts , with crowds fleeing in all directions . But for many , it was too late . According to an Israeli count , 270 people were killed at the scene . \" My best friend rang me , I was at home in Tel Aviv . She tried to hide . I heard the screams and the burst of automatic gunfire , \" young French Israeli Deborah told AFP . She did not want to give her surname . \" I do even know what they did with her body after she let out one last scream . \" The brutality and scope of the attack has left the entire country reeling in shock , with the Israeli press quick to draw parallels with anti Jewish pogroms and Nazi atrocities . Adding to the national trauma , the Israeli army announces at around pm that both \" soldiers and civilians \" had been kidnapped by Hamas and taken into Gaza , with 224 people now estimated to have been abducted . Following intensive Qatari led negotiations , Hamas has freed four female hostages over the past week , with 85 year old Yocheved Lifshitz recalling the \" hell \" of her abduction from Nir Oz kibbutz where militants threw her onto a motorbike and beat her on the way to Gaza . We are at war \" We are at war , \" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announces on the afternoon of October 7 , vowing to hit back with \" fire of a magnitude that the enemy has not known \" . Western capitals quickly condemn the Hamas operation , with Washington pledging \" rock solid and unwavering \" support for Israel . The US military also orders an aircraft carrier group to the eastern Mediterranean \" to deter hostile actions against Israel or any efforts toward widening this war following Hamas attack \" in a clear message to Iran which has hailed the \" success \" of the attacks . Lebanon powerful Iran backed Hezbollah militia also congratulates \" the resisting Palestinian people \" , hailing the actions of Hamas Ezzedine al Qassam Brigades for its \" heroic operation \" . Israel reaction is not slow in coming , with the military calling up reservists to join its army that counts personnel , among them both those doing mandatory service and career soldiers . And Israel begins a relentless bombardment of the tiny Palestinian territory which is home to million people and has been ruled by Hamas since 2007 . Now entering its day , the bombing has been incessant , with Gaza Hamas run health ministry saying the death toll has passed , with most of the victims civilians , nearly of them children . Since Hamas took over Gaza , the impoverished Palestinian territory has been subject to an Israeli blockade . This has been significantly tightened after the attacks , with the UN saying the tiny strip of land is in the grip of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis . Israeli commentators have been swift to call out Netanyahu government for wide ranging security and intelligence failures exposed by the devastating October 7 attacks , triggering a crisis worse than that of the Arab Israel war of October 1973 , when the country was caught flat footed by a combined Egyptian and Syrian assault . But accountability will have to wait amid calls for unity in the face of \" an existential war \" . As night falls on October 7 , the search continues for any gunmen left inside Israel , with terrified people still locked inside their homes and the streets deserted . Airlines cancel flights en masse , and Israelis are urged to make an immediate report of any suspicious movements .

              " 'Israel taps blacklisted Pegasus maker to track hostages in Gaza Israel security services are pulling in spyware companies , including the maker of the controversial Pegasus software , to help track hostages in the Gaza Strip , people familiar with the matter said . NSO Group and Candiru , both of which are blacklisted by the US , are being asked to quickly upgrade their spyware capabilities to meet needs laid out by the country security forces , according to four cybersecurity industry sources and an Israeli government official . They , together with several other software firms , are collaborating on the requests and largely offering their services for free , said the people , who asked not to be identified because of they were authorized to comment on military operations . The Defense Ministry did immediately respond to requests for comment . The Israel Defense Forces and NSO , which makes Pegasus , declined to comment . Candiru is ready to assist the war effort in any way needed , the company said in a statement Thursday , without elaborating . More than 200 people , including many foreigners , are captive in Gaza . While Israel in recent years has gone to great lengths to ensure the return of hostages , the violence of this month surprise attacks has led to broad support for an invasion . Western governments are pushing for more negotiations , and US President Joe Biden cited the safety of hostages on Wednesday as one reason he asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to pause a ground offensive . Israel has been discussing hostage rescue possibilities with other governments , which have offered intelligence and expertise on how to extract people if diplomatic efforts via Qatar and Egypt fall through , according to separate people familiar with the discussions .',\n",
              " 'Gazans Release Names of People They Say Were Killed in Israeli Strikes Also excluded were people believed to be still under the rubble and considered missing , those buried without being admitted to a hospital and those whose deaths had not been recorded by hospitals , it said , raising the possibility that the toll could be far higher . The Ministry of Health , which is part of the Hamas government in Gaza but employs civil servants who predate Hamas control of the territory , did not say why it had decided to publish the names of the dead . But it came after Biden said that he had no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed . He also added , I sure innocents have been killed , and it the price of waging a war . Biden did not explain his skepticism . Others have cast doubt on the soaring death toll cited in part because the Health Ministry is , ultimately , overseen by Hamas , which took control of Gaza in 2007 , after winning elections there and then battling the Palestinian Authority in the streets for control . The United States has long considered the Islamist political and militant group a terrorist organization .',\n",
              " 'Mike Johnson election as Speaker represents the rise of the Far Right in US legislature With Mike Johnson , a Republican representative from Louisiana , an ally of Donald Trump who backed his claims about the 2020 election being stolen , a staunch Far Right figure who celebrated the US Supreme Court verdict overturning Roe V Wade , and an evangelical Christian , elected as the new Speaker of the US House of the Representatives , the American legislature has entered unchartered territory . On his first full day on the job , Speaker of the House Mike Johnson , R , makes a statement to reporters about the mass shooting in Maine , at the Capitol in Washington , Thursday , 26 , 2023 . He did not respond to questions . AP ALSO After 3 weeks US House gets a Speaker , Trump aide Mike Johnson secures majority GOP support Johnson will now have to keep the Republicans united in the House and please his patron , Trump , while also addressing governance requirements which entails the House to pass relevant spending bills and collaborate with the Democratic administration or risk a a government shutdown . He will also have to navigate both issues of convergence between parties such as American support for Israel and divergences such as American support for Ukraine . If Johnson sticks to his Far Right inclinations , American polity is headed for a prolonged impasse and deepening of tensions between the legislature and the executive . If he displays an accommodative stance , which is unlikely , Johnson risks losing his already limited political capital and base at a time when even a single member of the House can seek to oust the Speaker . The fact that there is only a year to go for the presidential elections means that politically competitive instincts in the House are peaking on all sides of the aisle and the room for compromise is diminishing . The backdrop Johnson election on Wednesday 220 members backed him while 209 opposed him in the House came three weeks after Republican Far Right members ousted Kevin McCarthy as Speaker for what they saw as too accommodative an approach towards the Democratic administration . Since then , despite multiple rounds of voting , the Republicans had failed to elect a Speaker , either because moderates rejected far Right candidates such as Jim Jordan , the co founder of the House Freedom Caucus or because the Far Right rejected more moderate candidates such as Steven Scalise and Tom Emmer . But the prolonged delay in electing a Speaker was denting Republican credibility and had led to a sense of fatigue among the members , besides giving Democrats an opportunity to showcase the GOP as a force in disarray and incapable of governing . The mood on Capitol Hill was one of frustration , with the Republicans eventually consolidating behind Johnson and giving the Far Right a major triumph . The man and his politics Johnson , 51 , is a generally low key figure in the Republican Party , who is most prominent for his extreme positions on a range of political and cultural positions that have divided America . He was among the key figures in the House backing Trump claims on the 2020 elections and led an effort to the block the certification of the results . He opposed investigating the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol . He opposes same sex relationships and marriages and has pushed policies to restrict pedagogy around sexuality for children in federally funded institutions . He was the chairman of the arch conservative Republican Study Committee . Johnson and his wife are devout Christians . He has pushed many bills restricting abortion access nationally and welcomed the Roe v Wade verdict that ended national protection to abortion . And he is close to the oil and gas lobby , putting him firmly against climate action advocates . The challenges Johnson has to now both deal with an administration request for 105 billion for national security funding especially for Ukraine and Israel , and deal with the prospects of a federal government shutdown from November 17 unless the House passes the relevant appropriations bills . McCarthy had enabled the passage of a continuing resolution that allowed the government to stay open , but this is what triggered the rebellion from the far Right of his own party . Trump , who is exercising his power and influence in shaping the House dynamics , is seen as pushing for a shutdown and believes this will be blamed on his arch rival , President Joe Biden . Trump called Johnson a fantastic gentleman who will do a great job on Wednesday . Soon after his victory , Johnson said that sending aid to Israel , fixing the southern border , and reining in federal spending as his top priorities . In a statement on Wednesday , Biden congratulated Johnson and said he would work in good faith with the Speaker . We need to move swiftly to address our national security needs and to avoid a shutdown in 22 days . Even though we have real disagreements about important issues , there should be mutual effort to find common ground wherever we can . Finding that common ground is going to be exceedingly hard , for if Donald Trump rise represented the elevation of American Far Right in the executive branch , Mike Johnson rise represents the elevation of the uncompromising and extreme American Far Right in the legislative branch . Biden , who is battling multiple external and internal crises , will have to deal with a new interlocutor and a new , more challenging situation than that existed when McCarthy was speaker . All signs point to continued dysfunctionality and disruption in the governance matrix of the US .

Israel army yesterday said it had sent tanks , troops and armoured bulldozers into the enclave in a \" targeted raid \" on Wednesday night that destroyed multiple sites before withdrawing . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid the growing calls to temper the ferocious bombing campaign said Israel had been \" raining down hellfire on Hamas \" and killing \" thousands of terrorists \" . He said his war cabinet and the military would determine the timing of a \" ground offensive \" with the goal to \" eliminate Hamas \" and \" bring our captives home \" . Hamas armed wing said Israeli strikes have killed almost 50 of the 222 hostages its operatives seized during the attacks . Hamas has released four hostages so far . The Palestinian group released two elderly Isreli women on Monday citing \" compelling humanitarian \" reasons , after mediation by Qatar and Egypt . Their release comes days after a US mother and daughter were freed .

Since then , Gaza Hamas run health ministry says more than Palestinians have been killed by Israel relentless retaliatory bombardments , mostly civilians and many of them children .

              " 'Gaza : EU stops short of calling for ceasefire ahead of UN vote as crisis escalates CNN European Union leaders have stopped short of calling for a ceasefire in Gaza , instead appealing for humanitarian pauses to provide aid , as the UN warned its operations were being paralyzed by Israel bombardment of the besieged enclave . The communique , released after meetings Thursday in Brussels , follows several failed attempts by the UN Security Council to pass a resolution on the Israel Hamas war , with member states preparing to vote on another draft resolution this time put forward by Jordan on behalf of Arab states on Friday . Jordan Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told diplomats gathered at the United Nations Assembly Hall that collective punishment is not self defense . The resolution calls for a cessation of hostilities , the release of hostages , and the rejection of any attempts at forced transfer of the Palestinian civilian population . More than 2 million people trapped in Gaza are living through a deepening humanitarian crisis , hastened by daily airstrikes and an Israeli blockade of life saving fuel . Israel says Hamas is stockpiling fuel for its own use and has called on the militant Palestinian group that governs Gaza to share it . Health services have been crippled by power shortages and hundreds of thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes amid the bombing . Israeli strikes have killed more than people in Gaza , including thousands of children , since October 7 , according to figures released Thursday by the Hamas controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza . Pressure is building on the international community to persuade Israel to allow desperately needed aid into Gaza ; the United Nations and several countries in the region have called for an immediate ceasefire , while others advocate for a humanitarian pause in fighting . People search for survivors and the bodies of victims in the rubble of buildings destroyed during an Israeli bombardment , in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on October 26 , 2023 . Mahmud Hams AFP Getty Images But the world has so far failed to unite around a common position on the crisis , nearly three weeks since the outbreak of violence , sparked by Hamas brutal October 7 terror attacks and kidnapping rampage that killed over people in Israel and saw over 200 people taken to Gaza as hostages . Israeli ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan on Thursday said requests for a ceasefire were not an attempt for peace , but an attempt to tie Israel hands , preventing us from eliminating a huge threat to our citizens . Israel is not at war with human beings , we are at war with monsters , he added , saying , our goal is to completely eradicate Hamas capability and we will use every means at our disposal to accomplish this . His comments came as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel forces are preparing for the next stages in its war against Hamas , which is widely expected to come in the form of a ground incursion . The maneuvering will begin when the conditions are right . These conditions are complex because so is the campaign . The troops are ready , Gallant said in a briefing in Tel Aviv . For a second night , Israel military conducted targeted raids in northern Gaza overnight on Friday after vowing to continue ground raids over the coming days . The raids included aircraft and artillery strikes in the area of , the Israel Defense Forces IDF said . Video published by the IDF showed tanks and armored vehicles moving on a road near agricultural land as well as strikes on buildings and open areas . The incursions are intended to kill Hamas militants , lay the foundations for an all out invasion and neutralize explosive devices and reconnaissance posts , IDF spokesperson Rear Daniel Hagari said on Thursday . Meanwhile , six people were injured when a rocket struck the Red Sea resort city of Taba , in Egypt , early on Friday , according to official sources cited by Egypt affiliated Al Qahera News . The rocket hit an ambulance building and a residential area of the hospital administration in the city , which shares its border with Israel . It is unclear yet who fired the rocket . IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said at a press briefing Friday that Israel will cooperate with Egypt and the US to tighten the defense in the region against threats from the Red Sea area . Hagari said an aerial threat had been detected in the Red Sea area , which he said he believed was the cause of the strike in Egypt .

Fatima Shbair AP In pictures : The deadly clashes in Israel and Gaza Prev Next List of Gazans killed The health ministry in Hamas controlled Gaza on Thursday published a 212 page report listing thousands of names described as documented deaths since October 7 in Gaza which it blamed on Israeli military aggression . The ministry said the death toll is likely to be much higher and said its report excludes casualties who have not been identified , those buried without being brought to hospital for registration , or those still missing who number around . The list , which does not distinguish between combatants and non combatants but which does list age , sex and the victim ID card number , followed US President Joe Biden comments that he had no confidence in the figures of civilian casualties reported by the Gaza Health Ministry . Israel , along with the US , has expressed doubts about the casualty numbers being reported out of Gaza , but has not provided evidence that they are exaggerated . White House spokesman John Kirby called the Gaza based ministry a front for Hamas , though when asked he did not dispute that thousands of Palestinians , many innocent civilians , had been killed . The prime minister of the US backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank , Mohammad Shtayyeh , said the PA own health authority considers the numbers to be correct . Video Ad Feedback Surgeon slams Biden comment on Palestinian death toll Source : CNN They are our numbers , Shtayyeh said in an interview Thursday with Al Jazeera . These numbers are fed to us from the hospitals of Gaza every single day and are received by our Ministry of Health . The Ramallah based Palestinian Authority is run by a rival faction to Hamas , and operates the umbrella Ministry of Health which maintains a relationship with the ministry in Gaza . Death tolls for Gaza are released both in Gaza and Ramallah daily . CNN is not able to independently verify the death toll tabulated in Gaza . UN agency paralyzed by lack of fuel Israel has also accused Hamas of controlling life saving fuel supplies in Gaza , as basic services such as hospitals , bakeries and UN humanitarian operations are on the verge of shutting down due to a lack of fuel . Juliette Touma , the communications director for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency UNRWA , said the agency will be forced to halt operations altogether if it does not get enough fuel crucial for generating power for hospitals and desalinating water . UNRWA continues to struggle with very limited and dwindling fuel supplies , Touma said . Rationing of deliveries continues , including to medical facilities and bakeries . UNRWA is being paralyzed due to the lack of fuel deliveries into the Gaza Strip . The IDF said that the problem is not a lack of fuel in Gaza , but that it is in the hands of Hamas . IDF spokesperson Lt . Col . Jonathan Conricus told CNN on Thursday that Hamas controls between and perhaps more than one million liters of fuel of different types stored inside Gaza , according to Israeli military intelligence estimates . Some of it was stockpiled before , some of it stolen from the UN , some of it stolen by Hamas from private vendors , he said . CNN can not independently verify the amount of fuel in Gaza . Israel continues to block deliveries of fuel altogether to Gaza , saying that Hamas would only divert it for military use . Speaking to CNN on Thursday , another UNRWA spokesperson , Tamara Alrifai , said , Whether or not other sources of fuel exist in Gaza is of no direct relevance to us , we are a human agency and we should not be begging for fuel to nourish our own operations . With fuel rapidly running out , UNWRA is being forced to make difficult decisions over diverting power between bakeries and hospital wards with more than people now displaced and relying on a single piece of bread each day , Alrifai added . Twelve aid trucks carrying water , food , medicine and medical supplies but no fuel entered Gaza from the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Thursday , according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society PRCS . A total of 74 trucks have entered the strip since humanitarian aid transfers resumed several days ago , PRCS said . In normal times , the figure would be about 455 per day , the United Nations has said , meaning basic supplies are trickling into the enclave at a much slower pace than needed . The head of UNRWA warned the current aid provisions to Gaza were just for show and nothing more than crumbs , as he warned that hunger and disease were becoming major issues in the besieged enclave . Over the last week , I followed closely the focus about the number of trucks entering Gaza . Many of us saw in these trucks a glimmer of hope . This is , however , becoming a distraction , Philippe Lazzarini said at a press conference in Jerusalem on Friday . We should avoid conveying the message that few trucks a day means the siege is lifted for humanitarian aid . This is not true , Lazzarini added . The current system in place is geared to fail . What is needed is meaningful and non interrupted aid flow . Overcrowded hospitals on the brink of collapse say they are overwhelmed with the numbers of injured people and doctors have repeatedly told CNN they do have the supplies or the electricity to run critical functions to properly care for them .

              " 'Israel demands UN chief resign after he says Hamas attacks did not occur in vacuum Israeli officials railed at UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres Tuesday after he appeared to suggest the impetus for the Hamas terror group devastating October 7 attack on Israel was the Jewish state continued control of Palestinian territories , with the Israeli Ambassador to the UN demanding that he resign . It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum , Guterres said at a UN Security Council meeting on the Israel Hamas war , which erupted when the terror group ravaged Israeli border communities , killing some people , the vast majority of them civilians . The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation . They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence ; their economy stifled ; their people displaced and their homes demolished . Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing , Guterres said . Israel evacuated all settlements and military forces from the Gaza Strip under the 2005 Disengagement . It has maintained a tight blockade of the territory since Hamas took control in 2007 , as has Egypt , with Jerusalem saying it must do so to limit the terror group ability to arm itself for attacks . In the West Bank , settlements have expanded under consecutive governments with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly arguing the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority is not a partner for peace , having rejected several offers in the past . Guterres added that the grievances of the Palestinian people can not justify the appalling attacks by Hamas . And those appalling attacks can not justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people , an apparent reference to Israel ongoing campaign of airstrikes in the Gaza Strip that Hamas officials say has killed thousands . Get The Times of Israel Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up , you agree to the terms Israel was outraged by Guterres comments . UN envoy Gilad Erdan called them shocking , and demanded that the secretary general resign . Foreign Minister Eli Cohen canceled a meeting with Guterres , and Minister Benny Gantz labeled the UN chief a terror apologist . The UN Secretary General , who shows understanding for the campaign of mass murder of children , women , and the elderly , is not fit to lead the UN . I call on him to resign immediately , Erdan posted on There is no justification or point in talking to those who show compassion for the most terrible atrocities committed against the citizens of Israel and the Jewish people . There are simply no words . The Secretary General , who shows understanding for the campaign of mass murder of children , women , and the elderly , is not fit to lead the UN . Advertisement I call on him to resign immediately . There is no justification or point in talking to those who show compassion for the most Ambassador Gilad Erdan גלעד ארדן October 24 , 2023 Erdan said the remarks were horrible , and completely disconnected from the reality in our region . It sad that a person with such views is the head of an organization that arose after the Holocaust , he said . It really unfathomable . Foreign Minister Cohen , who had traveled to New York to take part in the meetings on the war , posted to X formerly Twitter that he was canceling a planned meeting with Guterres . After what happened on October 7 , he wrote , there is no place for an even handed approach . Hamas needs to be wiped off the face of the earth . Advertisement Gantz , who recently joined the government as a member of the narrow war cabinet overseeing the war effort , also had harsh words , posting to X : Dark are the days when the United Nations Secretary General condones terror . Absolutely nothing can justify the slaughter of innocent civilians , he wrote . Now is the time to stand on the right side of history , or be judged by it . Terror apologists can not speak on behalf of the world . On October 7 , Hamas abruptly bombarded Israel with thousands of rockets while over gunmen breached the border with the Gaza Strip . The terrorists rampaged murderously through southern areas slaughtering those they found , butchering entire families in some communities and also killing 260 at an outdoor music festival . Some victims were mutilated , raped , and tortured . Dozens of babies were killed . Before the IDF could counter the invasion , over 220 people of all ages were abducted and dragged back to Gaza as captives . Four have since been released . Israel has responded to the Hamas assault by vowing to destroy the terror group and launching intensive strikes in Gaza , saying it is hitting terror targets while trying to avoid civilian casualties . It has told over one million Gaza residents to evacuate the northern part of the Strip ahead of an expected ground incursion . The Hamas controlled Health Ministry says the strikes have killed over Palestinians so far . Those numbers can not be independently verified and are believed to include Hamas own members , as well as civilians killed by misfired Palestinian rockets . The Security Council session brought together top diplomats including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken , who has previously rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would only allow Hamas to regroup . Guterres said he was deeply concerned about the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza . Let me be clear : No party to an armed conflict is above international humanitarian law . The relentless bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces , the level of civilian casualties , and the wholesale destruction of neighborhoods continue to mount and are deeply alarming , he said . Advertisement Noting that he had previously condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented acts of terror by Hamas , Guterres called for all the hostages to be treated humanely and released immediately and without conditions . Along with its military campaign , Israel has also imposed a near total blockade of Gaza , though some humanitarian aid has been permitted to enter from Egypt in recent days under a US brokered deal . But that is a drop of aid in an ocean of need , Guterres said and cautioned that if Gaza runs out of fuel it will be a disaster . He warned the conflict risks spiraling throughout the region and appealed for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire while urging an eventual two state solution that would see a Palestinian state created alongside Israel . Cohen , the foreign minister , also attended the Security Council meeting , bringing with him family members of some of those held captive in Gaza . Addressing the forum , he warned that if the UN does not back the drive to eradicate Hamas , it will face its darkest hour on Guterres watch . Meanwhile , the UN on Tuesday called for improved coordination among humanitarian groups to make sure the small amount of aid now moving into the Strip contained only the most needed items . Advertisement UNRWA , the UN agency for Palestinian refugees , said that some of the food delivered into Gaza so far , such as rice and lentils , had been impractical given the dwindling availability of fresh water and fuel . An additional challenge in a very limited flow of supplies is that we are not really receiving the most needed supplies for Gaza , or the most relevant , UNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai said . In one of the shipments over the last couple of days , we received boxes of rice and lentils , she told journalists at the UN in Geneva via video link from the Jordanian capital Amman , where UNRWA has its headquarters . But for people to cook lentils and rice , they need water and gas . And therefore these kinds of supplies while very generous and well intended are not very usable right now , she said . Alrifai added that before October 7 , around 500 trucks a day were entering Gaza from Israel and Egypt , with a mixture of commercial goods , food , aid and fuel . But only a few dozen trucks carrying food , medicine , and water have entered Gaza via the southern border with Egypt since a deal entered into effect on Saturday . We will need to get better as a consortium of humanitarians in sending very explicit lists of what is most needed , Alrifai said . Fuel concerns The UN has warned that more hospitals and other vital services in the Palestinian territory risked shutting down without fuel deliveries . Israel worries that Hamas would use fuel brought into Gaza to manufacture weapons and explosives . The IDF also said Tuesday that Hamas is holding at least half a million liters of fuel for its military purposes , withholding it from hospitals . Alrifai said fuel crossings into Gaza could be logistically handled by UNRWA , which was obliged to report any misuse . When we at UNRWA receive fuel or any other equipment , we are accountable for its handling . A couple of close donors , close countries did raise the security question we are obligated to report to them any misuse that we see , or any risk , she said . Alrifai said UNRWA had in place a very sturdy diligence system to make sure that everything we receive is only used for humanitarian purposes . Israel has often accused UNRWA of failing to report Hamas misdeeds , essentially enabling the terror group to operate freely within Gaza civilian population . Medical aid Meanwhile , the World Health Organization WHO said it had been unable to distribute any life saving health supplies from the truck convoys to major hospitals in northern Gaza , because of a lack of security guarantees . It said the main Al Shifa hospital in the north now had three patients for every two beds . In addition to the hospitals that have had to close due to damage and attacks , six hospitals across the Gaza Strip have already shut down due to lack of fuel , the WHO said in a statement . Medical supplies have been delivered to four hospitals in southern Gaza and medics took boxes of supplies off the trucks and straight into operating theaters , where doctors have been performing surgeries without anesthesia or other basic surgical supplies , the agency said .',\n",
              " 'White House calls Iran complicit in conflict ; Biden says aid is getting to Gaza fast enough The second convoy of aid trucks cross the Rafah border from the Egyptian side on October 22 , 2023 in North Sinai , Egypt . Some humanitarian aid started coming through the Rafah crossing in Egypt on Tuesday , Reuters reported , citing the Palestinian Red Crescent . Some eight trucks arrived in Gaza late in the day carrying water , food and medicine , Reuters noted . Hospitals in Gaza have been warning that they would have to shut down if they do receive more fuel . Other supplies , such as water , medicine and food continue to run low . President Joe Biden told NBC News earlier Tuesday that humanitarian aid has not been arriving quickly enough . Meanwhile , 85 year old Yocheved Lifshitz , one of two Israeli hostages released by Hamas on Monday , spoke out about her abduction during the 7 multi pronged terror attacks carried out by the Palestinian group . \" I went through hell , \" she said of the experience of being taken hostage in a Tuesday press briefing . Hamas released her and one other elderly hostage late Monday , bringing the total to four . Israeli President Isaac Herzog said that Israel does not want a war with militant group Hezbollah , but Lebanon will \" pay the price \" if the two countries come into conflict . \" I think Hezbollah is playing with fire And I want to make clear , we are not looking for a confrontation in our northern border with anyone else , we are focused on destroying Hamas infrastructure and bringing our citizens back home , but if Hezbollah will drag us into war , it should be clear that Lebanon will pay the price , \" Herzog said at a press briefing with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron . His words come after recent hostilities between Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Israeli armed forces in northern Israel which has signaled that the conflict in Gaza could spread regionally .',\n",

              " 'India Hindu Extremists Are Trolling the Israel Conflict Shortly after midnight on October 8 , Mohammed Zubair , a fact checking journalist based in Bangalore , came across a video on Twitter . Less than a day had elapsed since the Hamas attacks in Israel , but the caption on the post claimed that Palestinians had shot down four Israeli helicopters in Gaza . Zubair had seen similar footage dozens of times before from the simulation video game Arma 3 , passed off as visuals from the Ukraine war . Zubair lives in close quarters with his parents , wife , and children ; his only time for solitary concentration is when his kids are asleep . As part of his daily work routine , he scours the internet for fake news and propaganda for an hour after midnight . To him , October 8 felt different : The deluge of disinformation he spotted on Indian social media left him stunned . The scale of misinformation this time was horrific and unimaginable , Zubair told me . A grim video of a beheading by a Mexican drug cartel was shared as an attack on Israeli citizens . A nine year old photograph of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his son , taken before the latter departed for his military service , was portrayed as the leader sending his offspring to war . Footage of a funeral staged in Jordan to evade a pandemic lockdown was misrepresented as Palestinians faking deaths in Gaza . A 2014 video of the Islamic State destroying a mosque in Syria was labeled as the Israeli bombing of a Palestinian mosque . Read : The war in Gaza is getting remixed in real time For the next few nights , Zubair found himself staying up until well after dawn , debunking the cascade of disinformation through his Twitter account , which has close to 1 million followers . According to him , roughly two thirds of the disinformation about the conflict was coming from the Hindu right , which is one of the most formidable purveyors of propaganda in the world . Dispensing with complexity and real world consequences , the disinformation machinery of the Hindu right has been operating in an amoral zone , treating the Israel Hamas war as little more than an entertaining spectacle happening somewhere far away , and as a windfall for its Islamophobic agenda . The Hindu nationalist movement has for decades complained of alienation from India largely liberal press , where , it claimed , its ideological vision was given short shrift . With the advent of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter , and messaging applications such as WhatsApp , the Hindu right had the tools to undercut the mainstream press and eventually overwhelm it . The Hindu right communications machinery is extensive and organized . A digital army numbering in the tens of thousands imprints the movement desired narrative on India public , regardless of the facts . In 2018 , while addressing the Bharatiya Janata Party social media conclave , Amit Shah , then the president of the party and the country home minister since 2019 , boasted , We could make any message go viral , whether sweet or sour , real or fake . Zubair told me that the party famed information technology cell was undergirded by a much larger unofficial trolling universe . The party taps low paid techies with Hindu nationalist sympathies to spread its message , for example . For them , it additional pocket money to communicate ideological convictions they already share , he said . In 2017 , Zubair , along with Pratik Sinha , founded Alt News , an independent website dedicated to combatting disinformation in India . Zubair and Sinha had both trained as engineers , and they shared an obsession with the seemingly uncontrollable epidemic of fake news in the country . What began as a three person enterprise now has close to 20 employees and bureaus in two Indian cities . As the website influence has grown , Alt News has attracted the ire of the Hindu right . In the summer of 2022 , Zubair was imprisoned for more than three weeks on a government charge that a satirical tweet he posted several years prior had hurt Hindu sentiments . Sinha , who has been a strident critic of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his role in the 2002 violence in the western state of Gujarat , left the province fearing for his personal safety . The group has nevertheless carried on with work that has become perilous in India ; according to Time magazine , Zubair and Sinha were among the favorites to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 . Since the Hamas attacks , Hindu nationalists across India have held rallies in support of Israel , while in states governed by the Hindu right , pro Palestine demonstrators have been arrested . The pattern is a striking anomaly for a country historically sympathetic to the Arab nation cause . In the Hindu nationalist imagination , Israel and India occupy parallel positions surrounded by Muslim enemies within and without . And the Hindu right approves of a country it perceives as a hard , militaristic , technologically advanced power that is ruthless in dealing with its Muslim foes . The movement identification with Israel is , in many ways , perverse . Hindu nationalism took root in the , inspired by the rise of European fascism . In 1931 , Moonje , the president of the Hindu Mahasabha , was deeply impressed by Benito Mussolini , whom he met on a visit to Italy . Golwalkar , the chief ideologue of the Hindu right , thought the Final Solution was a good lesson for Indians to learn and profit by . The timelines of India and Israel track closely with each other : India gained freedom from British colonial rule in 1947 , and the creation of Israel came a year later . Both countries were gripped with anxiety upon their founding , as civil conflicts raged in the background . But India and Israel were estranged for more than four decades ; formal diplomatic relations would not be established until 1992 . As the largest nation to have shaken off colonialism , India saw itself as the leader of the postcolonial world . Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru , India first and longest serving prime minister , viewed the Palestinian cause through the prism of that wider anticolonial struggle . India had little history of anti Semitism : A smattering of tiny Jewish communities had prospered in the country for centuries without facing any form of persecution . In the decades following its independence , India remained militantly allied to the Palestinian cause . In 1975 , India became the first non Arab country to grant the Palestine Liberation Organization full diplomatic status . In 1983 , Yasser Arafat , the charismatic leader of the PLO , received a rapturous reception during a visit to New Delhi . The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought an era of free market economics to India and a warming of its relationship with the United States . This shift in orientation set the conditions for India and Israel to establish diplomatic ties in 1992 . Since then , the two countries have moved closer . Over the years , we have seen a shift from India being pro Palestine to more pro Israel today , Suhasini Haidar , the diplomatic affairs editor of The Hindu newspaper , told me . The relationship has been on an upswing . More and more Indian Jews have been exercising the right to return ; direct flights to Tel Aviv began in 2018 . Last year , India joined a Middle East partnership , comprising Israel , the United Arab Emirates , and the United States , that pledged to address shared environmental and economic goals while reaffirming support for the Abraham Accords and other normalization arrangements with Israel . The move led to a significant worsening of the country long friendly relationship with Iran . Defense ties are central to the entente between India and Israel . India is , by some distance , the largest buyer of arms from Israel ; the country is seen as a dependable source of high grade military technology . During the 1999 Kargil War India brief conflict with archenemy Pakistan Israel came to New Delhi rescue with immediate military assistance . Israel has no diplomatic relations with Pakistan . Over the past decade , a close personal relationship between Netanyahu and Modi , both right wing populists embodying a muscular nationalism , has strengthened the ties between the two nations . Haidar covered Modi first state visit to Israel in 2017 . It was a five day lovefest , she told me . Netanyahu greeted Modi at the airport . They spent every waking moment together . Modi has borrowed from Netanyahu bold national security doctrine . In 2019 , a suicide bomber attacked an Indian paramilitary convoy , killing 44 people . Modi responded by striking deep into Pakistani territory . Later that year , during a national election in Israel , Netanyahu sought to buttress his foreign policy credentials by putting up giant banners flaunting his relationship with Modi , an honor previously reserved for American presidents . Israel knows that the Hindu right glorified Hitler , Haidar told me . Both sides try to ignore that . Hindu nationalists have sought to use the October 7 attack on Israel to further their own domestic ideological ends . They point to the violence in Israel to emphasize the menace of Islamic terrorism , a theme they believe will play in their favor in national elections next year . The subject has proved politically beneficial for Modi in the past : The 2019 military strike against Pakistan , undertaken on the eve of the last election , transformed a sputtering campaign . Read : Violence is the engine of Modi politics Now the Hindu right media actors , from national news anchors to itinerant social media trolls , are playing their domestic political games in a volatile global context . To an inflamed and polarized conflict in the Middle East , the Hindu right media ecosystem contributes mislabeled videos and fake stories , further muddying the distinctions between true events and motivated falsehoods . Not surprisingly under these circumstances , the claims that Hindu nationalists put forward are getting taken up by interested actors in other countries . Zubair , who spars online with the Hindu right all the time , now finds himself battling far right influencers in Israel and the United States who peddle false information originating in India . Five days after the Hamas attacks , Sinha , Zubair Alt News co founder , reflected on Twitter , Hopefully the world will now realise how the Indian right wing has made India the disinformation capital of the world .',\n",

Analyse humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza . For Your Information The Gaza Strip is 365 square kilometers 141 square miles in size and home to around million people , million of whom are refugees , according to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East . The UNRWA provides services in eight refugee camps across Gaza . The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated areas in the world at residents per square kilometre , according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA . Some 41 of the population in Gaza are under the age of 15 . Over million Gazans have been internally displaced since Hamas attacks on Israel earlier this month , the UN humanitarian coordination office said Friday . Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by Israel , the EU , US and several other nations . According to Hamas officials , more than Palestinians have been killed since the start of the conflict . The Gaza Strip has 13 hospitals , which are only partially operational due to supply shortages and fuel rationing , according to OCHA . A press release by Fabrizio Carboni , regional director for the Near and Middle East for the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC , warns that , Gaza loses power , hospitals lose power , putting newborns in incubators and elderly patients on oxygen at risk . Kidney dialysis stops , and X rays ca be taken . Without electricity , hospitals risk turning into morgues . The Gaza Strip has one power plant , generating about 70 megawatts of electricity per day . This covers a small fraction of the territory total energy needs of at least 400 megawatts , according to data collated by the OCHA . In addition , some 120 megawatts of power are ordinarily imported from Israel . On average , Gazans have received an average of 13 hours electricity per day this year . Following Hamas assault , Israel stopped supplying electricity to the Gaza Strip . With Gaza only power plant now out of fuel and offline , the territory is without electricity , meaning residents and institutions alike are dependent on power generators . Gaza unemployment rate stands at over 45 , according to OCHA data . Some 60 of people aged 15 29 are without work . Data gathered by the UN body shows that in 2021 , over 80 of Gazans employed in the private sector earned less than the minimum wage of 442 419 per month . UNICEF spokesman Stephane Dujarric has said that nearly 80 of Gazans rely on humanitarian assistance . Israel imposed a land , sea and air blockade of the Gaza Strip in 2007 , after Hamas took control of the territory . Since then , people movements into and out of the area through Israeli checkpoints and the sole crossing into Egypt at Rafah have been severely restricted , says the UNRWA . Following Hamas October 7 terror assault , Israel imposed a total blockade , shuttering all checkpoints and halting the delivery of food , aid , and fuel into the Gaza Strip . This means the Rafah crossing to Egypt the only checkpoint not controlled by Israel is the sole route for food , aid and other items into Gaza . In the past , the Rafah crossing has been shut for extended periods and only open on an irregular basis . Why the US is supporting Israel ?

Key Points to Ponder : What the ongoing Prabhash Ranjan Writes : The bilateral relations between India and Canada , already reeling from allegations about the former involvement in the killing of a Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil , have nosedived further . Canada latest accusation is that India has unilaterally revoked the diplomatic immunity of Canadian diplomats based in India , thus violating international law . What is Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations ? India is in violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations VCDR , according to For Your Information Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations VCDR an international treaty that provides the framework for the conduct of diplomatic relations between independent countries . VCDR strives to balance the interests and imperatives of receiving states the host country where a diplomatic mission is based and sending states the country that sends the diplomatic mission to another country . Canada charge is very serious , but not borne out by the facts . India did not revoke the immunity of Canadian diplomats . It asked Canada to cut down the size of its mission by taking back several diplomats based on the principle of parity . India demand was communicated to Canada through regular diplomatic channels , and Ottawa was given adequate time to perform this task . At the most , it can be argued that had these diplomats continued to stay in India , they would have lost their diplomatic immunities . But this would be a logical outcome of the sending state Canada not taking back these diplomats despite the receiving state India demand . This is different from Canada charge that India has revoked diplomatic immunities . India did declare any of these diplomats persona non grata unacceptable person . However , as the receiving state , India has the right to do so under Article 9 of VCDR without explaining its decision to the sending state Canada . Does India has the right to ask Canada , or any country , to cut down the size of its mission operating on Indian soil ? How did India relationship with Canada fare historically ? India Canada bilateral relations know in detail How have India Canada relations deteriorated in recent months ? Why recent allegations by Canada are troubling and unprecedented ? For Your Information Canada India relations have see sawed over the last 50 years . During the Cold War , bonhomie developed between Ottawa and New Delhi due to their shared commonwealth status and convergent views on the importance of the United Nations , multilateralism , and advancing global development . Differences over Cold War crises in Korea , Hungary , and Vietnam strained the relationship . India nuclear programme tested ties further . In the , Ottawa interest in India was rekindled by rising Indian immigration . With limited prospects for trade or security relations , there was no basis for meaningful diplomatic engagement . Since then , however , much work has gone into reviving the relationship from its nadir in 1998 , following Ottawa repudiation of India nuclear power status . Investment and trade form the heart of the relationship now , with considerable scope for growth . These issues and the bilateral relationship are held hostage by specific diaspora elements that harbour a deep hatred toward India , abhor its territorial unity and strive to Balkanise it . Anti India activities and politically condoned hate crimes are some of the harsh terms that India has used to describe situation in Canada What has caused India to take such a decisive step ? By calling it politically condoned hate crimes and criminal violence , Delhi is targeting the Trudeau government Why ? Canada hosts one of the largest Indian diasporas in the world Can you tell little more on this ? For Your Canada hosts one of the largest Indian diasporas in the world , numbering 16 lakh people of Indian origin , accounting for more than 3 percent of the total Canadian population and NRIs . India became the top source of foreign students studying in Canada lakh , according to 2022 data . India total trade with Canada goods and services in 2021 22 was US billion , much below potential , but when it comes to India import of pulses , almost 30 of the total import comes from Canada . Canadian pension funds have cumulatively invested around US 55 billion in India . Cumulative FDI from Canada since 2000 is about billion . All these have continued despite speed bumps like the recent pause in trade talks and despite challenges over the Khalistan issue . As per the 2021 Canadian census , Sikhs account for per cent of Canada population , and are the country fastest growing religious group . After India , Canada is home to the largest population of Sikhs in the world . Today , Sikhs lawmakers and officials serve at all levels of Canada government , and their burgeoning population is one of the most important political constituencies in the country .

General Studies I : Modern Indian history from about the middle of the eighteenth century until the present significant events , personalities , issues . General Studies II : Indian diaspora Key Points to Ponder : What the ongoing story As far as traditions of folk theatre go , Ramleela is one of India most famous , performed across north India during the autumnal Navratri celebrations . Variations aside , it basically is a dramatic re enactment of Tulsidas Ramcharitmanas , telling the story of Lord Ram . Major incidents in the epic are covered in an episodic way , with an interplay between dialogue and musical verses . Performances last days , and culminate on Dussehra with the burning of the effigy of Ravan , representing the victory of good over evil . In this broad form , Ramleela has travelled to distant corners of the world with the Indian diaspora . Here we look at one such instance that of Trinidad , an island in the Caribbean with a significant Indian population . How did Ramleela reach Trinidad ? So , what exactly was Indian indentured labour ? Do You Know In early century Britain , calls to abolish slavery intensified . Slave trade was banned in 1807 , and finally abolished in 1834 in the British Empire . This , however , created a massive problem in many British colonies whose economy depended on slave labour . The island of Trinidad , where sugar formed the backbone of the economy , was one such colony . In 1838 , the enactment of the emancipation legislation in Trinidad was followed by a large scale emigration of emancipated slaves from the sugar estates . Plantation owners , desperate to keep their economy afloat , turned to indentured labour from India . On May 30 , 1845 the very first boatload of indentured Indians came to Trinidad . While seen as more human than slavery , indentured servitude was nonetheless brutal for labourers . Agents back in India would lure unsuspecting Indians to it with the promise of riches and opportunity . A part of their wages would be withheld till the end of the contract . This way , labourers would effectively be under bondage while working in back breaking conditions on the plantations . Use of indentured labour from colonies like India unfolds a story of uneven power relations , between labour in the colonies and capital in the ruling country under State patronage , economist Sunanda Sen wrote in Indentured Labour from Indian in the Age of Empire 2016 . Today , Indians mostly descendents of these labourers who continued to enter Trinidad as late as 1917 form the largest ethnic group in Trinidad , at around 35 per cent of the total population . Most came from the present day eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar . When travelling to these distant lands , indentured individuals were unable to carry many material possessions .

              " 'Explained : What War Crimes Laws Apply To The Israel Gaza War War between Israel and Palestinian forces since Hamas group October 7 assault have created a huge and rising death count and accusations of war crimes on both sides . The war falls under a complex international system of justice that has emerged since World War Two . Even if states say they are acting in self defence , the rules of armed conflict apply to all participants in a war . WHAT LAWS GOVERN THE CONFLICT ? Internationally accepted rules of armed conflict emerged from the 1949 Geneva Conventions , which have been ratified by all UN member states and supplemented by rulings at international war crimes tribunals . A series of treaties governs the treatment of civilians , soldiers and prisoners of war in a system collectively known as the \" Law of Armed Conflict \" or \" International Humanitarian Law \" . It applies to government forces and organised armed groups , including Hamas militants . Advertisement WHAT ACTS COULD VIOLATE WAR CRIMES LAW ? New York based Human Rights Watch cited as possible war crimes the deliberate targeting of civilians , indiscriminate rocket attacks , and the taking of civilians as hostages by Palestinian armed groups , as well as the Israeli counter strikes in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians . Advertisement The taking of hostages , murder and torture are explicitly banned under the Geneva Conventions , while Israel response could also be subject to a war crimes investigation . In response to the Hamas violence , Israel put Gaza , home to million people , under siege and launched by far the most powerful bombing campaign in the 75 year old history of the Israeli Palestinian conflict , destroying whole neighbourhoods .',\n",

Ghazi Hamad , a member of Hamas political bureau , was interviewed by BBC Middle East correspondent Hugo Bachega about the brutal killings of over Israelis , most of them civilians , during the terror group October 7 onslaught . Faced with harsh international condemnation as evidence gradually emerged of the barbarity with which they ordered the massacre of innocent people , Hamas leaders have repeatedly denied targeting civilians , claiming the group policy was to exclusively attack IDF forces around Gaza . In his sit down with the BBC correspondent , Hamad reiterated the terror group false mantra , claiming that the civilian deaths were the result of confrontations and not planned in advance . There was no command to kill any civilians , Hamad said . The area there is very wide , there are many people there , and there were clashes and confrontations .

I can tell you we did not have any intention or decision to kill civilians , Hamad insisted . Advertisement How do you justify killing people as they sleep , families ? the BBC journalist asked . Faced with that question , Hamad pulled off the microphone attached to his jacket , threw it to the side , and said : I want to stop this interview . Overwhelming evidence has emerged that the terror group , in preparation for the assault , instructed its members to murder Israeli civilians and take captives . The Israeli government on Monday screened for 200 members of the foreign press some 43 minutes of harrowing scenes of murder , torture and decapitation from Hamas October 7 onslaught , including raw videos from the terrorists bodycams . The government said it had decided to show journalists part of its collected documentation in order to dispel what a spokesperson characterized as a Holocaust denial like phenomenon happening in real time . The footage was collected from call recordings , security cameras , Hamas terrorists body cameras , victim dashboard cameras , Hamas and victims social media accounts , and cellphone videos taken by terrorists , victims and first responders . Advertisement The materials included a recording of a Hamas terrorist who took part in the slaughter bragging to his parents of slaughtering Jews . In the call , the man can be heard excitedly telling his parents that he is in Mefalsim , a kibbutz near the Gaza border , and that he alone killed 10 Jews . Look how many I killed with my own hands ! Your son killed Jews ! he says , according to an English translation . Look how many I killed with my own hands ! Your son killed Jews ! Listen to a phone call of a Hamas terrorist calling home , bragging about how many people he massacred . The whole world needs to hear this . Israel Defense Forces October 24 , 2023 A partially coded document found in a vehicle used by Hamas terrorists included instructions to burn homes , cars and fields , and contained a code term for slaughter all captives , according to the Kan broadcaster . Apprehended Hamas members have revealed in interrogations they were ordered to carry out atrocities against Israeli civilians . In one video released by the Israel Defense Forces , a terrorist said that gunmen were given instructions to kill everyone they saw , including beheading victims and cutting off their legs . Hamas , together with other terror groups , led the October 7 assault which saw some terrorists break across the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip by land , air and sea , killing some people and seizing at least 233 hostages of all ages , under the cover of thousands of rockets fired at Israeli towns and cities . Advertisement Israel says it now intends to destroy the Iran backed terror group infrastructure inside Gaza and has vowed to dismantle the organization while minimizing harm to Gaza civilians . The IDF has been calling on Palestinians to evacuate from northern Gaza southward , as it intensifies strikes in the Gaza City area . If you watch one thing today it should be this .

Shelley Greenspan October 26 , 2023 Gaza Hamas run health ministry says the strikes have killed over people , many of them children . The figures issued by the terror group can not be independently verified , and are believed to include its own terrorists and gunmen killed in Israel and in Gaza , and the victims of what Israel says are hundreds of errant Palestinian rockets that have landed in the Strip since the war began .

              " 'The Hamas tunnel city beneath Gaza : a hidden frontline for Israel The Hamas tunnel city beneath Gaza : a hidden frontline for Israel What lies in wait for Israeli ground troops in Gaza , security sources say , is a Hamas tunnel network hundreds of kilometres long and up to 80 metres deep , described by one freed hostage as \" a spider web \" and by one expert as the \" Viet Cong times 10 \" . The Palestinian Islamist group has different kinds of tunnels running beneath the sandy 360 sq km coastal strip and its borders including attack , smuggling , storage and operational burrows , Western and Middle East sources familiar with the matter said . The United States believes Israel special forces will face an unprecedented challenge having to battle Hamas militants while trying to avoid killing hostages held below ground , a official said . Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin noted that Iraq nine month long battle to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State might prove to have been easier than what awaits the Israelis likely to be \" a lot of IEDs improvised explosive devices , a lot of booby traps , and just a really grinding activity \" . Even though Israel has invested heavily in tunnel detection including a sensor equipped underground barrier it called an \" iron wall \" Hamas is still thought to have working tunnels to the outside world . After the last round of hostilities in 2021 , Hamas leader in Gaza , Yehya Al Sinwar , said : \" They started saying they destroyed of Hamas tunnels . I am telling you , the tunnels we have in the Gaza Strip exceed . Even if their narrative is true , they only destroyed 20 of the tunnels . \" HOSTAGE WITNESS There has been no corroboration of the comment by Sinwar , who is thought to be hiding underground ahead of an expected Israeli ground offensive . But the estimate of hundreds of kilometres is widely accepted by security analysts , even though the blockaded coastal strip is only 40 km 25 miles long . With Israel in full control of Gaza air and sea access and 59 km of its 72 km land borders with Egypt 13 km to the south tunnels provide one of the few ways for Hamas to bring in weapons , equipment and people . While it and other Palestinian groups are secretive about their networks , recently released Israeli hostage , 85 year old Yocheved Lifshitz , said : \" It looked like a spider web , many , many tunnels , \" adding : \" We walked kilometres under the ground . \" Hamas believes that with Israel overwhelming aerial and armoured military superiority , tunnels are a way to cut some of those advantages by forcing Israel soldiers to move underground in cramped spaces the Hamas fighters know well . An Israeli military spokesperson said on Thursday : \" I wo elaborate on the number of kilometres of tunnels but it is a high number , built under schools and residential areas . \" Urging the United Nations Security Council to intervene , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called for an immediate cessation of \" aggression \" on Gaza and moves toward \" a political solution instead of military and security solutions \" . UNDERGROUND CITY Israeli security sources say Israel heavy aerial bombardments have caused little damage to the tunnel infrastructure with Hamas naval commandos able to launch a seaborne attack targeting coastal communities near Gaza this week . \" Although we have been attacking massively for days and days , the Hamas leadership is pretty much intact , as is the ability to command and control , the ability even to try and launch counter attacks , \" said Amir Avivi , a former brigadier general whose senior positions in the Israeli military included deputy commander of the Gaza division , tasked with tackling tunnels . \" There is a whole city all over Gaza underneath with depths of 40 50 metres . There are bunkers and headquarters and storage and of course they are connected to more than a thousand rocket launching positions . \" Other sources estimated depths of up to 80 metres . One Western security source said : \" They run for miles . They are made of concrete and very well made . Think of the Viet Cong times 10 . They have had years and lots of money with which to work with . \" Another security source , from one of Israel neighbouring countries , said Hamas tunnels from Egypt remain active . \" The supply chain is still intact these days . The network involved in facilitating co ordination are some Egyptian military officers . It is unclear if there is knowledge of this by the Egyptian army , \" he said . A small number of narrower , deep , smuggling tunnels were still operating until recently between Egypt and Gaza , according to two security sources and a trader in the Egyptian city of El Arish , but they had slowed to a near halt since the Israel Hamas war started . Egyptian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment . On Wednesday , Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi said while inspecting military units in Suez that the army role was to secure Egyptian borders . LONG GAME Hamas was created in Gaza in 1987 and is thought to have begun digging tunnels in the , when Israel granted Yasser Arafat Palestine Liberation Organization some degree of self rule in Gaza . The tunnel network is a key reason why Hamas is stronger in Gaza than in the Israeli occupied West Bank , where Israel settlements , military bases and monitoring devices make it harder to get anything in from Jordan . Tunneling became easier in 2005 when Israel pulled its soldiers and settlers out of Gaza , and when Hamas won power in a 2006 election . Shortly afterwards Hamas military wing , the Izz el Deen al Qassam Brigades , captured Gilad Shalit and killed two other Israeli soldiers after burrowing 600 metres to raid the Kerem Shalom base on the Gaza border . A year later Hamas launched a military strike against Arafat forces in Gaza using tunnel mounted attacks . Although the military tunnels remained off limits to outside eyes , during that era Gaza smugglers would show off their scarcely concealed commercial tunnels under the Rafah border . These were around three feet one metre wide and used winch motors to haul goods along the sandy tunnel floors in hollowed out petrol barrels . One Rafah tunnel operator , Abu Qusay , said a half mile tunnel took three to six months to dig and could yield profits of up to a day . The most profitable item was bullets , bought for 1 each in Egypt and fetching more than 6 in Gaza . Kalashnikov rifles , he said , cost 800 in Egypt and sold for twice that . In 2007 the military wing is thought to have brought its commander Mohammed Deif into Gaza through a tunnel from Egypt . Deif was the mastermind behind Hamas deadly 7 attack into Israel , which killed people and hostages were taken . TUNNEL HUNTING Professor Joel Roskin , a geomorphologist and geologist with Israel Bar Ilan University said it was difficult to map the tunnel network accurately from the surface or space , adding highly classified information was essential for mapping and imagery visualization . Among the elite units tasked with going underground is Yahalom , specialist commandos from Israel Combat Engineering Corps known as the \" weasels \" , who specialise in finding , clearing and destroying the tunnels . Earlier this week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Yahalom fighters , telling them : \" I rely on you , the people of Israel rely on you . \" Israeli sources said what awaits them is formidable and they faced an enemy that has regrouped and learned from previous Israeli operations in 2014 and 2021 . \" There are going to be a lot of booby traps . They have thermobaric weapons that they did have in 2021 , which are more lethal . And I believe they acquired a lot of anti tank weapon systems that are going to try to hit our APCs armoured personnel carriers , tanks , \" said Amnon Sofrin , a former brigadier general and former commander of the Combat Intelligence Corps . Sofrin , who was also previously head of the intelligence directorate with Israel Mossad spy agency , said Hamas would also be trying to kidnap soldiers . Daphne Richemond Barak , professor at Israel Reichman University and author of the book Underground Warfare , said the conflicts in Syria and Iraq had changed the situation . \" What the IDF Israeli military is likely to face inside the tunnels is also all of the experience and all of the knowledge that has been gained by groups like ISIS Islamic State and has been passed on to Hamas . \"',\n",

              " 'Misunderstood : White House on Joe Biden theory of reason behind Hamas attack The White House on Thursday said President Joe Biden had been \" misunderstood on his theory of the reason behind the Hamas terror attack on Israel on October 7 that killed over people . Biden , talking to reporters at a joint news conference on Wednesday , said that he is convinced that one of the reasons why Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel was because of the recent announcement during the Summit in New Delhi on the ambitious India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor that integrates the entire region with a network of railroad . advertisement Responding to a question regarding Biden theory of the reason behind the Hamas attack on Israel , National Security Council Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby said President Joe Biden had been \" misunderstood \" . I think you misunderstood him . What he said was that he believed that the normalization process and the agreement that we were trying to reach between Israel and Saudi Arabia for normalization , which we believe is an important stepping stone to getting to a two state solution , was what may have motivated Hamas to to conduct those attacks . I think you misunderstood what he actually said , Kirby answered the reporter . Biden told reporters at a joint news conference on Wednesday with the visiting Australian Prime Minister , Anthony Albanese , that his analysis is based on his instinct and does not have any proof for this . I convinced one of the reasons Hamas attacked when they did , and I have no proof of this , just my instinct tells me , is because of the progress we were making towards regional integration for Israel , and regional integration overall . We ca leave that work behind , Biden said . This was the second time in less than a week that Biden has mentioned the India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor IMEEC as a potential reason for the terrorist attack by Hamas . Israel has launched a massive counter offensive against Hamas after unprecedented attacks by the militant group on October 7 killed more than people .',\n",
              " 'Israel Gaza live news : UN says civilians in Gaza feel abandoned , as only crumbs of aid get in There have been two very publicly admittable incursions by Israeli troops in the last couple of nights : the first in northern Gaza , the second one last night further down towards central Gaza . It involved several ground troops , several tanks and the IDF the Israeli Defense Forces said it was aimed at a specific set of Hamas related targets close to the central part of Gaza , not far from the border fence . The IDF said its objective was met , the target was destroyed and there were no Israeli casualties . In the first night , there were significantly more vehicles involved including tanks and bulldozers . The Israeli government and the Israeli army say that has been part of a process of literally laying the ground , laying paths , for what might be to come clearing minefields and Hamas positions close to the border . Also last night , the Israelis said they killed a senior Hamas commander named as Shadi Barud he was a deputy Hamas commander who Israel says was directly involved in preparing those attacks on 7 October , when thousands of Hamas armed men broke through the border fences and killed people in Israel . So Israel is not just taking out sites and Hamas targets where it can identify senior Hamas operatives it is , in Israeli words , neutralising them as well .',\n",
              " 'Blasts hit two Egyptian Red Sea towns near Israel border , six injured Israel points to an aerial threat after projectiles hit Taba and Nuweiba , towns not far from Israel and Gaza . Projectiles hit two Egyptian Red Sea towns on Friday , sources and officials say , wounding at least six people in Taba near the border with Israel . Egyptian army spokesperson Colonel Gharib Abdel Hafez said an unidentified drone crashed into a building adjacent to a hospital in Taba in the early hours of the morning . Later , another projectile fell near an electricity plant in a desert area of the town of Nuweiba , two Egyptian security sources told the Reuters news agency . This was also reported by Egypt Al Qahera News , which said investigations into the incident were under way , citing sources with knowledge of the matter . Witnesses in both towns confirmed to Reuters that they heard explosions and saw smoke rising and Egyptian warplanes flying overhead . There was no claim of responsibility , but the incident is believed to be linked to the continuing Israel Hamas war that has been raging in Gaza since October 7 , when Hamas fighters launched an attack on Israel , killing at least people . Israeli air raids on Gaza have since killed at least Palestinians . Nuweiba is 72 km 44 miles from Taba , which is about 220 km 135 miles from the Gaza Strip . Taba straddles Egypt border with Israel Red Sea port of Eilat . After the blast , Israel military said it was aware of a security incident outside its borders . Without specifying the location , Israel military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said combat helicopters were scrambled when an aerial threat was spotted in the Red Sea region . To our understanding , the strike that took place in Egypt originated in this threat , he added in a televised briefing . Israel will work with Egypt , and the United States , and bolster regional defences against threats from the Red Sea region . Taba , in Egypt Sinai Peninsula , is popular with tourists . It is about a three hour drive from Egypt Red Sea resort town of Sharm el Sheikh . The blasts highlight the risks facing Egypt and other countries in the region as fighting intensifies between Israel and Hamas . Egypt has taken an active role in negotiating access to aid for Palestinians , trying to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas and advocating for a ceasefire . But its proximity to the front line has exposed it to risks . On October 22 , several Egyptian border guards were injured after being accidentally hit by fragments of a shell from an Israeli tank . Israel apologised for the incident . Other regional countries , including Lebanon and Syria , have also been peripherally caught up in the fighting . Iran backs Hamas and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah , which Israel has clashed with in skirmishes along the Israel Lebanon border . On Thursday , the United States said it had attacked two Iran linked facilities in Syria , following a series of attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria . Last week , the US military said a navy warship in the northern Red Sea intercepted projectiles launched by Yemen Houthi armed group potentially towards Israel .',\n",

              " 'Analysis : What does Israel Gaza incursion propaganda video reveal ? It a message to Israelis and the world that the Israeli military is preparing for an invasion , but it also carries clues on strategy that Hamas will have noted . On Thursday , October 26 , Israel released footage of a nighttime incursion into Gaza Strip . The Israeli military accompanied the heavily edited video with a statement claiming that in preparation for the next stages of combat , the Israeli military operated in northern Gaza . Israeli army tanks infantry struck numerous terrorist cells , infrastructure and anti tank missile launch posts . The soldiers have since exited the area and returned to Israeli territory . The video is obviously intended as propaganda , to send a message both to Israeli society and to the outside world . It attempts to tell Israel and the Israelis we are not just sitting and waiting , we are doing something . That is very important , as the Israeli military tries to counter doubts and uncertainties among the country population about why Israel has launched a full fledged ground invasion of Gaza yet despite saying it will go in soon almost three weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks that killed people in Israel . Rather than openly confirm or deny hints that the civilian leadership and the military command may not exactly be seeing eye to eye , the Israeli military counters the doubts by the video . The Israeli army hopes that it will be read as our military is preparing , doing something , trying and testing in real conditions . If that message is well received and accepted , as Israeli propaganda masters intended , it would ease internal tensions . No citizen no society wants to be in a position where he or she asks whether their leadership is lying to them or concealing something ? Unlike in most other countries , majority of Israelis serve in the armed forces and undergo regular refresher training where they are introduced to the latest tactics and technologies . They are well prepared to judge military matters themselves . Most will immediately recognise that the force filmed consists of a tank company , with 12 15 formidable Merkava tanks , reinforced by armoured bulldozers and supported by long range artillery from the rear . There are just glimpses of heavy armoured personnel carriers , but it is to be assumed that they would carry a company of infantry . Forces on the ground are assisted and monitored by aerial assets , from drones filming the action to successive layers of unmanned aerial vehicles , helicopters and fixed wing aircraft that are not shown but are certainly deployed . Israelis will see the video as well produced and timely . It surely eases tension and doubt , and tells them that their military forces can go in , and out , at will . Palestinian fighters in Gaza , and the rest of the world are looking at it with different eyes and for different reasons . Hamas armed wing is undoubtedly reading into the release from a tactical point of view , to judge what it can expect from its enemy and prepare for it . While I can not rule out the possibility that the video is a total deception , intended to mislead the enemy into believing that Israel will attack in a way different from the one it demonstrates in its own propaganda , I believe that , at this stage , of preparations that would be too far fetched . It would be confusing for units to fight in one way for the cameras and then radically change operational methods in a matter of days for the real battle . Despite its primary intention to convey a targeted message , it reveals much more possibly even what the Israeli military never intended to divulge at this stage . Firstly , it confirms what I predicted almost a week ago : Israelis will breech their own concrete barriers using the ubiquitous armed bulldozers that will lead the armoured column through the gap . The video shows one bulldozer digging up the mines with its powerful shovel , the second sweeping them to the sides , widening the advance lane , allowing the follow on vehicles to bypass any tank or armoured personnel carrier that is unable to advance . A recovery tank is , expectedly , included in the force , to tow back any armour incapacitated either by landmines or Hamas ground teams , rockets from multiple launchers or anti tank missiles . The most revealing details from the video concern the tactics of deployment of tanks and accompanying infantry . Usually , tanks in contact with the enemy extend and advance in parallel over a wide front , with tanks side by side , spaced 20 50 metres 66 164 feet apart . They are accompanied and closely followed by dismounted infantry whose task is to deal with hidden opposing forces . Defenders who have had plenty of time to prepare could be lying in wait to hit the advancing armour from the close range of 100 metres 328 feet or less . Only dismounted infantry offers a field of vision over a wide front to engage such opposition quickly and efficiently . But the Israeli military forces are shown advancing in a line a riskier way to approach determined defences . When tanks , and accompanying infantry , are spread wide , defenders have to cover very wide angles to re aim from one target to another . The attacker has the advantage that several tanks can concentrate fire on any point in front of them . An attacker advancing in a column can engage enemy bunkers straight ahead of it with one gun only . If it is taken out of action the next in line must bypass it , risking uncleared minefields or non discovered resistance points . The video also shows infantry staying inside armoured vehicles during the advance . So , the Israeli military does not think it would encounter significant resistance in the first two to three kilometres miles of open desert and fields . A clear sign that Israel expects significant resistance only when forces reach the first buildings at the outskirts of Gaza City . Finally , the video suggests that the units will be commanded from the ground , at battalion level , covering the three or four companies involved in each line of advance . It also confirms that Israeli commanders will have a clear tactical overview of the battlefield from numerous drones like the one that filmed the video . Higher commands might only monitor and coordinate but crucial real time decisions on the ground will be made by experienced operational lieutenant colonels . The video does not help answer the biggest question : Will there be a ground offensive ? But the world and Hamas , no doubt will have taken note .',\n",
              " 'Israel Hamas war : Pegasus makers , other blacklisted spyware firms roped in to track hostages in Gaza Since its ghastly attack on Israel , Hamas has kept hundreds of Israelis including foreigners captive in Gaza . In a major development , Israeli security forces have roped in spyware firms like Pegasus maker to track hostages in the Gaza strip , reported Bloomberg citing sources . Along with Israel , countries like Italy and the US are also keen to bring back the hostages before negotiating on ceasefire in the ongoing war . However , firms like NSO Group and Candiro , both of which are blacklisted by the US , are being asked to quickly upgrade their spyware capabilities to meet needs laid out by the country security forces , four cybersecurity industry sources told BB . The news was also confirmed by an Israeli government official . The two firms , along with several other software firms , are collaborating on the requests and largely offering their services for free , sources told BB on request of anonymity . Till now there has been no official confirmation by the Defense Ministry on the news . Moreover , the Israeli Defense Forces and NSO also declined to comment . The other US blacklisted firm , Candiru , offered to assist the war effort in any way needed , the company said in a statement on Thursday . Hamas militants have held more than 200 people captive in Gaza . The recent level of violence in Gaza has led to broad support for an invasion . Whereas , the Western governments are pushing for more negotiations , and US President Joe Biden asked PM Benjamin Netanyahu to pause the ground offensive for the safety of hostages on Wednesday . Other hostage rescue possibilities for Israel Since the beginning of the war , Israel has been trying to bring back hostages via diplomatic routes with the help of Qatar and Egypt . As the efforts are yielding no result , Israel has been discussing other hostage rescuing possibilities with other governments which have offered intelligence and expertise on how to extract people . More than half of the hostages have foreign passports , including agriculture workers , visitors , and people with dual citizenship . Four hostages have been freed since the fighting began . The surprise attack by Hamas on October 7 that took lives of more than innocent Israelis , mostly civilians . The surprise assault by Hamas , which is designated as a terrorist organization by the US and European Union , marked the deadliest ever strike on Israel . Since the attack , Israel has responded with heavy air bombardments on Gaza , killing thousands of Palestinians according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas run enclave . Israel preparation to launch a ground invasion of Gaza has sparked fear among Palestinians of another ethnic cleansing . About NSO Pegasus software Earlier , the US sanctioned NSO and Candiro for helping authoritarian regimes track journalists and dissidents . NSO Pegasus software is sold to governments and law enforcement agencies . Governments use this software to hack into mobile phones and covertly record emails , phone calls , and text messages . Amnesty International , Citizen Lab , and Forensic Architecture in 2021 documented the use of spyware in more than 60 cases to target government critics in countries including Rwanda , Togo , Spain , the United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia , Mexico , Morocco , and India . Several reports also suggested the use of Pegasus software by the Indian government . The US Commerce Department blacklisted NSO and Candiru that year , banning them from receiving export contracts from American companies . \" Exciting news !

              " 'Israel war of self deceit When has killing more Palestinians ever resulted in better security for the Israeli society ? Already in its third week , Israel war on Gaza has so far killed more than Palestinians , injured thousands more , and displaced more than one million . Despite calls from some quarters for a ceasefire , there seems to be no end in sight for the suffering of Gaza two million residents . Having long embraced the dehumanisation of the Palestinians , Israeli society is filled with rage and the primordial drive for revenge over the killing of Israeli civilians by Hamas fighters on October 7 . This blind fury is now channelled into a genocidal drive by the narcissism and extremism of one man : Benjamin Netanyahu , a doubled faced , pathological liar , who has done everything and anything to stay in power . Netanyahu arrogance , corruption and callousness are to blame for the country political and military failures that led to the October 7 attacks . He thought he could just transform all of historic Palestine into a Greater Land of Israel , by making the occupation of the Palestinian territories permanent and keeping millions of Palestinians in an open air prison in Gaza and segregated bantustans in the West Bank all with no repercussions . On October 7 , his arrogance finally caught up with him , because arrogance breeds stupidity . Hubris turned into humiliation , and the fiasco into farce , or as Israelis say , using Arabic words , the fashla failure turned fadiha scandal . And while Israel military and intelligence heads have accepted responsibility for their failures to prevent the attacks , Netanyahu has refrained from taking any responsibility , even though most Israelis blame him for their national tragedy . Instead of resigning , the shamed and shameless prime minister cum wartime leader has gone on to wage a sadistic war with no clear strategy or endgame . In his genocidal offensive , Netanyahu has been aided and abetted by his former Western detractors , who until recently were expressing concern about his plans to undermine Israel judiciary , through his coalition of fanatics and fascists , in order to stay out of jail . First and foremost among them is US President Joe Biden , who went from snubbing Netanyahu for much of the year to embracing and shielding him from the wrath of Israelis and Arabs alike . Biden has committed America to Netanyahu genocidal war on Gaza , offering American arms , tactical assistance in urban warfare , and diplomatic leverage . He has ordered the deployment of two aircraft carriers in the Eastern Mediterranean to protect Israel and deter the likes of Iran from intervening in the conflict . Likewise , European leaders , who had also given Netanyahu the cold shoulder for much of the year , are now clamouring to show their support for his government and his war on Gaza . They have refused to call for a ceasefire and continued to justify the mounting Israeli war crimes as an exercise of the right to self defence . Israel Western stooges love to evoke international law in all the wrong ways . Israel , indeed , has the right to self defence , but not to defend its decades long brutal military occupation , long enabled by Western powers . It is rather the occupied and victimised Palestinian people living under the Israeli racist system of apartheid that have the right to resist their tormentor under international law . The ongoing genocidal war spearheaded by a failed prime minister and supported by his morally suspect Western allies is not one of self defence ; rather , it is a war of self deceit . Israel falsely believes that it could attain security by the sword . But when has killing more Palestinians ever resulted in better security for Israeli society ? It never has ; it never will . Imposing a hermetic blockade on Gaza and unleashing a bombing rampage to pave the way for a land invasion , Israel will face dangerous regional blowbacks . In its genocidal drive , it may , as some fear , drag the US into World War III . Sensationally and falsely comparing Hamas attacks on Israel with those carried by al Qaeda on the United States in 2001 will not help . The war on terror the US unleashed on the world killed even more Americans than the attacks did , along with hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim victims . It sowed chaos that more war and more troops could not stop for the past two decades . If anything , the war on terror proves that war crimes , collective punishment and other violations of international law do not mitigate extremism ; they perpetuate it as they fuel the cycles of violence something UN Special Rapporteur on Counter Terrorism Fionnuala Ni Aolain emphasised during a recent news conference focusing on the Israeli war on Gaza . As the Israeli army commits more war crimes against the Palestinians of Gaza , Israelis need to have a good look at where colonialism and occupation have gotten them . Perpetual Israeli oppression , racism and killings of the Palestinians have created the conditions for greater instability , extremism and violence in Palestine and the region . A genocidal war on Gaza will not bring peace and quiet to the Israeli society , nor to those in the West abetting it .',\n",

Heavyweights including Tom Emmer of Minnesota , Jim Jordan of Ohio and Steve Scalise of Louisiana , were unable to secure the gavel by cornering the minimum of 217 votes , despite being nominated to the role . While Johnson has now emerged as the Speaker , second in line for the presidency , after much confabulations and voting , the politically messy process of his win signals serious deadlock in the party and the Chamber . In a sense , the intra party fractures that impeded the House Republican caucus from taking forward funding bills relating to the federal government , Israel and Ukraine , reflect the contradictions between the Congressmen who support and are supported by former President Donald Trump on the one hand , and those who are not in that category , on the other . Shortly after Emmer pulled out of the contest , Trump described him on social media as a Rino , or Republican in Name Only , who never respected the power of a Trump endorsement or the breadth and scope of MAGA , and that it would be a tragic mistake to support him . Trump acolytes in the House took their cue from the President , it appears , and they are a sizeable cohort . Looking beyond the political embarrassment of this rupture , it portends trouble for the Grand Old Party in the 2024 presidential election . It certainly does appear at this time as though Trump will win his party nomination by a considerable margin . However , many traditional conservatives do not side with him on hot button issues , including criminal charges that he faces , for example for obstructing justice in seeking to delegitimise the results of the 2020 presidential election . If the House Speaker saga indicates anything , it is that the dissonances within the Republican Party will sooner or later be manifested in popular anger among conservatives , and that might be an even greater barrier to Trump political ambitions than the opposition he faces from Democrats .',\n",
              " 'The Harrowing Work Facing Gaza Doctors in Wartime In Gaza , surgeons are operating by flashlights , rationing anesthetics , and running out of precious fuel needed to keep patients alive . As the World Health Organization reports that more than one third of the city hospitals are no longer operating and Israel bombing continues , health care professionals fear the worst . The health system here is in its last throes before it completely boots down . If the electricity goes , that it . It just becomes a mass grave , says Ghassan Abu Sittah , a British Palestinian plastic and reconstructive surgeon who has been working at Al Shifa hospital over the last two weeks . There no hospital , if there no electricity . Read More : Our Death Is Pending . Stories of Loss and Grief From Gaza Right now , his sense is that it will be days , rather than weeks , until Al Shifa runs out of fuel needed to keep the hospital running . Palestine Ministry of Health said Tuesday that hospital generators will stop running in 48 hours , and aid workers tell TIME that the city is expected to run out of fuel on Wednesday evening . More From TIME The situation is particularly dire for neonatal babies . Hatem Edhair , the head of the neonatal intensive care unit at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis , fears that electricity shutting off will mean five babies dependent on ventilators will die . If there is no electricity , it means the end of their life because oxygen will not be available , he says . Ahmed Mhanna , manager of Al Awda hospitals in northern Gaza , said Monday that the hospital only had enough fuel to run another three to four days . They have been relying on two generators that have been consuming more than 13 liters per hour , he says . If there no fuel , it means the generator will stop . If the generator will stop , the hospital will stop . We will close , he says . Mhanna is unfazed by the sound of a blast while on a phone interview with TIME . Asked whether he wants to cut the call , he responds : No , it OK : they are bombing everywhere all the time . We are feeling absolutely unsafe in the hospital . We are worried , we are afraid , we are human beings but we can not do anything except continue our mission with our patients , he says . So far , Israeli attacks have killed more than people and injured more than people in Gaza , according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health run out of the West Bank . More than half are women and children . The Palestinian Ministry of Health also reports 73 medical personnel have been killed , more than 100 have been wounded , and 25 ambulances are out of service .

As the works to funnel more than 14 billion in aid for Israel , pro Palestinian advocates and aid groups are calling for a ceasefire with little success . Read More : The Gaza Healthcare System Is Reportedly on the Brink of Collapse The sheer number of injured Palestinians means Al Shifa is operating well beyond its maximum capacity of about 700 patients instead dealing with between to people , Abu Sittah says . Hospital compounds have become makeshift tent cities not only for patients but also civilians seeking shelter . You feel that there a public health catastrophe waiting to happen , Abu Sittah says . So many people in such a small space , with inadequate access to hygiene and sanitation , can lead to an outbreak of infectious diseases , he says . Having dead bodies remain in the streets is another source of potential infection , health experts warn . Al Shifa hospital also ca sterilize surgical equipment properly . Abu Sittah has been going out to the corner store to buy bottles of vinegar and laundry detergent to clean wounds . He feels forced to cut some surgeries short because of how many patients he needs to treat . Everyday you make more and more compromises about what you can and ca do , Abu Sittah says . Even Edhair hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza Israel had ordered a mass evacuation from northern to southern Gaza on 13 has had its share of nearby explosions . Last week , he says two airstrikes landed near the hospital , causing mothers to flee their rooms , crying . This is terrifying , he says . We all are afraid of war . I want everyone to know we are civilians . On Monday morning , he found an airstrike just 500 meters from his home , he says . His mother told him not to go to the hospital but he refused to listen . More than 20 hospitals have been asked to evacuate in the northern Gaza strip , according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health . The Israeli government called Al Awda hospitals less than a week ago and told Mhanna personally they have to evacuate staff and patients , he says . I refused , of course , because where can I deal with my patients ? All the hospitals in Gaza are overcrowded , people are lying in corridors . A crime is a crime , even if you make it by appointment . Ghassan Abu Sittah Al Shifa Hospital has received similar warnings . Giving notice by telling hospitals that they need to evacuate knowing very well that not possible does not make targeting hospitals less of a war crime , Abu Sittah says . A crime is a crime , even if you make it by appointment . And as hospitals switch to caring for the victims of recent violence , routine care is almost impossible to provide . When we think about war , we often focus on the victims of airstrikes but ordinary lives do stop . Women still go into labor . They still have miscarriages , ectopic pregnancies , preterm births , and hemorrhages , says Brenda Kelly , a consultant obstetrician in Oxford , Many operating theaters in Gaza are now dealing with trauma related injuries , leaving less room to treat pregnant women .

More than kidney dialysis patients have had their session time reduced from four hours to hours per patient , according to Palestine Ministry of Health . About cancer patients rely on chemotherapy to stay alive and the only hospital providing this service is running on a single generator expected to stop working within 24 48 hours , the ministry noted . She says the group has already released more than half a million dollars worth of medical supplies to hospitals across Gaza . But it not enough . Some operations have been conducted without anesthesia , which I find barbaric , she says . We do not live in the middle ages . Omar Abdel Mannan , a British Egyptian senior pediatric neurology resident in London , co founded the social media account , which shares firsthand accounts from health care professionals in the city . He says hospitals in Gaza were running on fumes even before recent airstrikes , as the city has been facing a blockade for more than a decade . One story that haunts Abdel Mannan is from a pediatric intensive care doctor in Gaza who said she was torn between helping two patients who arrived at the intensive care unit . She had to basically let one not survive and choose the other one to keep them alive , he says . She was heartbroken over the idea that she having to make these decisions that almost feel like you playing God because of the sheer volume of patients coming through the door . In the meantime , doctors are feeling powerless not only about dwindling supplies but about the scale of casualties . On Monday , after Abu Sittah finished operating on a young Palestinian girl , he tried to console her , saying that her procedure went well and she was alright . She said to me : things will never be alright : they killed my mom and dad .',\n",

              " 'As the UN votes on the Israel Gaza war , Palestine can only observe As a non member observer , Palestine can speak at UN meetings but ca vote on resolutions about the situation in Gaza . The 193 members of the United Nations General Assembly are expected to vote on the Israel Gaza war on Friday , but as an observer rather than a member , Palestine will not have a say . Jordan , acting on behalf of Arab countries , has proposed a General Assembly resolution calling , among other things , for a humanitarian ceasefire after the smaller more powerful UN Security Council failed to take action , despite the rising death toll from Israel continued bombardments . I appeal to all of you to vote to stop the killing . Vote for humanitarian aid to reach those whose very survival depends on it . Vote to stop this madness , Palestine UN ambassador Riyad Mansour said in an emotional speech to the UN General Assembly on Thursday . The Palestinian foreign minister also addressed the UN Security Council at a special session this week , but as a non member observer state , Palestine is not able to participate in the same way as full UN member states . As UN members continue to discuss how they will respond to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza , here is a quick guide to Palestine status at the UN . Non member observer In 2012 , the majority of the 193 members of the General Assembly voted to grant Palestine non member observer status . A total of 138 of the UN General Assembly 193 members voted yes , while nine voted no and 46 abstained or did not vote . Among the countries that voted no were the United States , Israel and Canada as well as Pacific Island nations including Nauru and Palau . Non member state observer status is not officially recognised in the UN Charter but has a long history . It was first held by Switzerland and is currently held only by Palestine and the Holy See , also known as the Vatican . The decision to grant Palestine non member status was far from the first , or last time , the General Assembly has voted on Palestine . In 1947 , the then members of the UN General Assembly voted on a resolution titled the future government of Palestine . The resolution decided that Palestine would be partitioned into two states with the creation of Independent Arab and Jewish States as well as a Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem . The resolution passed with 33 of the members of the UN General Assembly voting yes . The number of members of the UN at the time was significantly smaller than it is today , as dozens of present member states had yet to gain independence from European colonial powers . Two years later , in 1949 , the State of Israel was admitted to the UN as its member . Who represents Palestine ? On Tuesday this week , Palestine Foreign Minister Riyad al Maliki addressed the UN Security Council open debate . Al Maliki is part of the Palestinian Authority , which is led by a different political grouping to Hamas , which controls Gaza . The Palestinian Authority continues to represent Palestinians at the UN although at home its authority to govern on behalf of all Palestinians is complicated . Could Palestine become a full UN member ? In 2019 , the UN General Assembly voted to allow Palestine to temporarily exercise limited additional powers while it chaired the Group of 77 , a grouping at the UN which originally had 77 members , but now has more than 130 . One of the countries that opposed the temporary measure was Australia . Gillian Bird , Australia ambassador to the UN at the time told the General Assembly that Australia voted no because it saw Palestinian attempts to seek recognition as a state in international fora as deeply unhelpful to efforts toward a two state solution . While the General Assembly casts votes on new proposed members , it is the Security Council which decides which candidates are considered . The council has 15 members , but the five permanent members China , France , Russia , the United Kingdom and the US have the power of veto . The US has used it some 34 times to block resolutions critical of Israel . Who gets to vote ? When the Security Council is unable to act , the General Assembly must step up , Dennis Francis , the president of the General Assembly , said when he called a special meeting of the General Assembly this week at the request of Jordan , Mauritius and several other countries . NEW : Arab Group circulates amended UNGA draft resolution to UN member states which replaces call for \" immediate ceasefire \" in with a call for \" an immediate , durable sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities . \" Amended draft now Rami Ayari October 26 , 2023 Unlike the Security Council , which has only 15 members , the UN General Assembly includes all 193 of the UN member states . Votes in the UN General Assembly are also less complicated than in the Security Council , where resolutions have often been blocked by the permanent veto . China , Russia and the United States have all used their veto to block Security Council resolutions on Israel Gaza in the last two weeks . But while UN General Assembly members do sometimes take a different approach to Palestine than the UN Security Council , UN General Assembly resolutions are considered less legally binding than Security Council resolutions , especially when it comes to the currently much contested calls for ceasefires . As both UN bodies continue to consider their carefully worded resolutions , Mansour reminded UN members to remember we are meeting here while Palestinians in Gaza are under the bombs .',\n",

              " 'How Pro BJP WhatsApp , Facebook Groups Are Using the Israel Hamas War to Stoke Islamophobia Mumbai : From alleging there are hundreds of Gaza Strips within India and claiming Hindus face an imminent Hamas like Islamist attack and insisting that only Prime Minister Narendra Modi can save India from it , to expressing glee at the deaths of Palestinians and claiming the Congress was behind the attacks , pro Bharatiya Janata Party BJP right wing online spaces are furiously peddling Islamophobia and targeting the BJP rivals with disinformation , by using the Israel Hamas war as cover . Within pro BJP WhatsApp groups as well as Facebook pages and groups , named after BJP leaders , social media users have weaponised the ongoing war to push their Hindutva agendas deeper by training their guns at a familiar target : Muslims . Using photos and videos , along with text messages , the messaging in these groups seeks to convince users that Islam and Muslims were to be singularly blamed for the war . Simultaneously , it dehumanises the sufferings of Palestinians by branding them as jihadis and terrorists . Since October 7 , when Hamas launched air and land attacks against Israel , over Israelis and nearly Palestinians have been killed . Among the Palestinians are over children who were killed in Israeli bombing . Yet , across these groups , jokes about their deaths as well as mocking their suffering were common . Prateek Waghre , policy director at the Internet Freedom Foundation , said such messaging was part of a broader trend concerning propaganda in Indian right wing spaces . There has been a definite tendency over the last few years in India to try to incorporate global events into the constant narrative that paints mostly Muslims but sometimes even moderate Hindus as an enemy or a threat , said Waghre . Much of this , Waghre said , was owing to the religious angle of the conflict between the Jewish state of Israel and the Muslim dominated Palestine . This author accessed 13 WhatsApp groups , all of them expressing clear support for the Hindutva ideology , the BJP , Narendra Modi and the RSS through the names of the groups as well as the display photos , generally featuring images of Modi and Adityanath . The groups are not being named to protect the author access . The number of members in these groups range from anywhere around 50 to nearly 400 . In addition , the author accessed multiple Facebook groups and pages , which displayed open affiliations to the BJP and its leaders . Broadly , much of the propaganda in these groups falls under four different themes from dehumanising Palestinian suffering and delegitimising support for them , to making the Israel Gaza war relatable by drawing historical Indian comparisons to it , to warning Hindus about an Islamist attack and pitching the BJP and Modi as the country only hope to fight this . Just like Kashmiri Hindus A significant proportion of messages on these groups attempts to try and make the war more relevant to an Indian audience . It does this by drawing parallels to the situation , but selectively . The plight of Israelis , these messages insist , is like Kashmiri Hindus . Circulating a video , ostensibly of an Israeli family held hostage by Hamas terrorists , the message asks readers to look at the fear on their faces . This is the same what Kashmiri Hindus faced in 1990 sic , the message says . The purpose behind the comparison becomes clear at the end of the message : Indian wokes will call it RSS propoganda , in reality ISLAM IS PEACE LOVING RELIGION sic , it says , sarcastically . Similarly , Hamas is equated to Islamic invaders like Humayun and Babur , both of them ostensibly attacking non Muslims with similar brutality . The corollary of these comparisons comes in a later bunch of messaging : referring to the violence by Hamas , the messages would remind readers of Jauhar , believed to be the practice of self immolation by the wives and children of warriors in medieval times when the warrior was facing defeat . One meme shows a photo of a half covered body , purportedly of an Israeli woman being dragged by Hamas terrorists . To Avoid This Our Hindu Women Did Jauhar During Mughals Era , reads a caption with the image . This is a commonly circulated message . On a Facebook page named Yogi Adityanath for PM 2024 , with over followers , the administrator of the page posts a similar message : Hamas has made us understand why Hindu women committed Jauhar . A warning for you Having convinced members of these groups that the war was a relatable one , a large strand of messaging is focused on stoking fears of an imminent attack on Indians , but especially Hindus , by Hamas like Islamist terrorists . In the future , India could also face conspiracies and attacks like Israel . The possibility of Hindu women facing cruelty ca be ruled out , the viral message warns . To avoid this , the message adds , Hindus needed to be alert and do two things : carry weapons and carry out a complete social boycott of Muslims . Some messages claim Israel used to let Palestinians from Gaza into Israel everyday . These , apparently , were secretly carrying out reconnaissance missions for the Hamas and were terrorists in disguise , the messages claim . Then , the message points to the Muslims within India , without naming them . Now imagine , we have 15 crore terrorists amidst us , who we think share our DNA , the message concludes . The messaging in these groups does just stop at warning of impending attacks , but goes a step further and asks its audience to imagine how the conflict would even play out , and stokes anger against Islamic nations . When the civil war begins in India , do you think the 59 Islamic countries will stand by you ? They will stand by the Muslims , it insists . You will always be the kaafir for them . Amidst these warnings , one popular strand of messaging launches stinging attacks on the Congress , using disinformation and outright manufactured facts . One , for instance , found on both WhatsApp and Facebook , insists that the nation should , after the Israel Hamas war , be grateful to Nathuram Godse , the man who killed Mahatma Gandhi . If not for him , India would have had a kilometre long Gaza patti strip across the country , it says , while being accompanied by an image the Indian sub continent , showing a green corridor cutting through India , connecting Pakistan and Bangladesh erstwhile East Pakistan . These messages disparagingly call Gandhi Ganduji and claim that he had accepted this proposal by Jinnah for such a corridor . However , fact checking sites have repeatedly debunked claims that Gandhi accepted such a proposal . Many messages blame the Congress for these attacks by Hamas and claim that former PM Rajiv Gandhi had given Yasser Arafat , the chief of the Palestine Liberation Organisation , a peace prize . This was a lie : Arafat received the Indira Gandhi Award For International Justice and Harmony award in New Delhi , but this was given to him by the Indian Council of World Affairs . The award , in fact , was given in January 1992 , while Gandhi had been assassinated in May 1991 . Singh was the prime minister during the time of the ceremony , and the government was , incidentally , supported by the BJP . But the messages make no mention of this . Delegitimise support for Palestine Most of these groups are full of videos and photos , purportedly of the war , showing the civilian casualties of the war , except they are almost exclusively meant to show the sufferings of Israelis , while mocking at the sufferings of Palestinians . These groups joke about how Palestinians , conflated with terrorists , were going to be rewarded with hoors , beautiful girls when they go to heaven after their deaths . Another viral image across many of these groups is a badly damaged structure , in ruins , which resembles a stairway going nowhere . The groups , quoting the image , express glee at how Palestinians were now directly going to gain entry into jannat , heaven . This constant dehumanising of their sufferings , then , also extends to expressing support towards them . In constant messages and memes , those backing Palestinians are described as snakes . No shortage of snakes in India , one message describes protests against Israeli air strikes targeting civilians . I am just in the way A very frequent presence across these groups is of the prime minister , Narendra Modi . A popular , common message across groups was an image of a grim Modi , staring straight back and asking readers to realise what happening in Israel can happen in Bharat ! ! The message serves both as a warning for Hindus and as an endorsement of Modi . The attack is imminent and Modi is the only person who can save Hindus from such an attack . In reality , they are not after me , they are after you . I am just in the way , reads a caption around Modi photo . Another viral piece of propaganda has photos of Modi , home minister Amit Shah and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval , asking people to be grateful before you sleep tonight to these three , for keeping India safe . It does not make mention of any terror attacks that occurred during the last nine years . Such endorsements of Modi go hand in hand with messages stoking hate and anger against Muslims . A video , featuring Modi , is repeatedly circulated across these groups . In the video , undated , Modi is seen talking about Muslims . They have divided the world into three parts , Modi says , going on to talk about Dar al Aman , Dar al Harab and Dar al Islam , which he explains as land of peace , land of conflict and the third being to convert the whole world into Islam . This video is accompanied by the same caption in all these groups : I will vote for Modi 100 times for a Safe India what ever may come in the way . He explained this before 20 years sic . Similar messages , while warning of an impending Islamic attack on India , pitch Modi as the perfect counter for this . Messages ask supporters to forget about concerns like cheap petrol and free ration , warning that there were countless traitors inside the country . It asks readers to remember the plight of Ukrainians . Without naming Modi , these messages ask voters to vote for a STRONG LEADER .

Key Points to Ponder : What the ongoing As the campaign for the November 30 election picks up steam in Telangana , there is one issue on which there hardly any traction : the manner in which the state applies its stringent preventive detention law to address law and order and deny bail . So what if the Supreme Court has repeatedly red flagged it , calling it a callous exercise of exceptional power and a pernicious trend in Telangana .

Under what laws can the state order preventive detention ? For Your Information Among central legislations , the National Security Act , the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act , 1974 COFEPOSA are examples of laws under which preventive detention can be ordered . As many as 25 states also have preventive detention legislations , like the Telangana law , which is called The Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of BootLeggers , Dacoits , Drug Offenders , Goondas , Immoral Traffic Offenders , Land Grabbers , Spurious Seed Offenders , Insecticide Offenders , Fertiliser Offenders , Food Adulteration Offenders , Fake Document Offenders , Scheduled Commodities Offenders , Forest Offenders , Gaming Offenders , Sexual Offenders , Explosive Substances Offenders , Arms Offenders , Cyber Crime Offenders and White Collar or Financial Offenders Act , PD Act , 1986 .

Why stringent preventive detention law in Telangana ? Advertisement Do You Know As per the 2021 Prison Statistics by the National Crime Records Bureau , Telangana ranks second among all states in the number of detainees in prison , behind Tamil Nadu . At the end of 2021 , Telangana had as many as 396 detainees under this special law . Preventive detention laws give powers to the police to arrest an individual to maintain public order . The detention orders are examined by an advisory board , also formed by the state . Crucially , a detainee is not allowed legal representation before the advisory board and the law under Section allows the state to not disclose the grounds of detention if it considers it to be against the public interest . Public order is defined broadly in the explanation to Section of the law as encompassing situations that cause harm , danger or alarm or a feeling of insecurity among the general public or any section thereof or a grave wide spread danger to life or public health . Preventive detention is an exceptional law to be used sparingly . When it is applied to simply circumvent bail and continue keeping a person in jail , it violates due process , said senior advocate Mohana Reddy , whose practice mostly focuses on preventive detention . Both the Supreme Court and the Telangana High Court have underlined while striking down detention orders that preventive detention can not be invoked to circumvent granting of bail that the state can not detain an accused when he is likely to be released on bail for the same offences . What Supreme Court said about the same act ? What Telangana High Court said about the same act ? For Your Information In a ruling on September 4 , an apex court bench of Justices Surya Kant and Dipankar Dutta noted that a pernicious trend prevalent in the state of Telangana has not escaped our attention while striking down a detention order that was issued to prevent the accused from being released on bail . In a judgment in April 2022 , a Supreme Court Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud had termed Telangana use of the preventive detention law a callous exercise of the exceptional power . And called upon the state to evaluate the fairness of the detention order against lawful standards . Article 22 grants protection to persons who are arrested or detained know them in detail Detention is of two types , namely , punitive and preventive Know them in detail Punitive Detention and Preventive Detention Compare and Contrast Article 22 confers certain rights on a person who is arrested or detained under an ordinary law What are they ? What are the powers of the state ? How do courts assess the detention orders ? For Your Information Article 22 prescribes protection against arrest and detention but has a major exception . It says in Article 22 3 b that none of those safeguards apply to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention . The remaining clauses Article deal with how preventive detention operationalises . First , the state , which would be the district magistrate , would issue an order to detain a person when it is necessary to maintain public order . The state can delegate this power to the police as well . If the detention ordered is for more than three months , under Article , such a detention requires the approval of an Advisory Board . These Boards are set up by states and normally consist of retired judges and bureaucrats . A detainee is generally not allowed legal representation before the Board . If the Board confirms the detention , the detainee can move Court challenging the detention order . Article of the Constitution mandates that the state is required as soon as maybe , to communicate to the detainee the grounds of detention and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order . A basic set of facts that are the grounds for detention are required to be communicated in one instalment , and the state can not then add fresh , new or additional grounds to strengthen its original detention order . The grounds have to be read in a language that the detainee understands . However , even this safeguard is diluted to a certain extent by Article , which says that nothing in clause 5 shall require the state to disclose facts that the state considers to be against the public interest to disclose . For preventive detention , there are very narrow grounds of judicial review because the Constitution emphasises the state subjective satisfaction when ordering a detention . The touchstone on which the order is examined is this subjective opinion of the state rather than the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution . When the Court can not substitute the subjective satisfaction of the state with its own satisfaction , it essentially means that it can not check the veracity of the facts mentioned in the grounds of detention . A judicial review is limited to whether the Advisory Board applied its mind , considered all material facts and whether the state showed obvious malafide in ordering detention . Because judicial review is limited , courts often strike down detention orders on technical grounds , such as delay in the decision of the advisory board , communication of grounds in a timely fashion and in a language that the detainee understands , etc .

Key Points to Ponder : What the ongoing ACCUSING HER of accepting money to ask questions in Parliament , BJP Lok Sabha MP Nishikant Dubey has hauled Trinamool Congress TMC parliamentarian Mahua Moitra before the House Ethics Committee , and now approached the Lokpal . Dubey accuses Moitra of taking bribes from businessman Darshan Hiranandani to ask questions against the Adani conglomerate , in return for favours . In a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla seeking a probe , Dubey said the case was reminiscent of the 2005 cash for questions scam . What is exactly cash for query case ? What is the procedure for raising the questions ? For Your Information The procedure for raising questions is governed by Rules 32 to 54 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha and Directions 10 to 18 of the Directions by the Speaker , Lok To ask a question , an MP has to first give a notice addressed to the lower house Secretary General , intimating their intention to ask a question . The notice usually contains the text of the question , the official designation of the Minister to whom the question is addressed , the date on which the answer is desired , and the order of preference , in case the MP tables more than one notice of questions for the same day . A Member is allowed to give not more than five notices of questions , both for oral and written answers , in all , for any day . Notices received in excess of five from a Member for a day , are considered for the subsequent concerning that during the period of that session only , according to a government document , Question Hour in Lok Sabha . Usually , the period of notice of a question is less than 15 days . There are two ways through which MPs can submit the notices of their questions . First , through an online Member Portal , where they have to enter their ID and password to get access . Second , through the printed forms available in the Parliamentary Notice Office . The next stage is when the Speaker of Lok Sabha examines the notices of the questions in the light of the laid out rules . It is the Speaker , who decides if a question , or a part thereof , is or is admissible . What are the conditions for the admissibility of questions ? What are the different types of questions ? Do You Know There are four different types of questions : starred , unstarred , short notice questions and questions addressed to private Members . A starred question is asked by an MP and answered orally by the Minister in charge . Each MP is allowed to ask one starred question per day . Starred questions have to be submitted at least 15 days in advance so that the Minister in charge has the time to prepare the answers and only 20 questions can be listed for oral answers on a day . When a question is answered orally , supplementary questions can be asked thereon . An unstarred question receives a written reply from the Ministry . These also need to be submitted at least 15 days in advance . Only 230 questions can be listed for written answers in a day . Unlike starred questions , unstarred questions do permit any follow up questions . While starred questions are better suited to inquire about the government views on issues and its policy inclination , unstarred questions are more conducive for getting answers to queries related to data or information , according to a report by PRS Legislative Research . Short notice questions are ones pertaining to a matter of urgent public importance . They can be asked with less than 10 days notice , with reasons for the short notice . Like a starred question , they are answered orally , followed by supplementary questions . The question to a private Member is addressed to the MP themselves . It is asked when the subject matter pertains to any Bill , Resolution or any matter relating to the Business of the House for which that MP is responsible . For such questions , the same procedure is followed as in the case of questions addressed to a Minister with such variations as the Speaker may consider necessary or convenient , the government document said .

Key Points to Ponder : What the ongoing Among Indian metros , Delhi gets the most attention for its notoriously high pollution levels . But it has been evident for some time now that bad air problems affect large parts of the country . As a series in this newspaper has pointed out , Mumbai has experienced an air quality crisis during the post monsoon period for the second consecutive year . For most of October so far , the Air Quality Index AQI in Maharashtra capital has registered moderate or poor . The city has not had a single good air day this month . Why has the air quality been bad in Mumbai of late ? Mumbai overall Air Quality Index touched 191 , way worse than Delhi this happened ? What are the reasons given by experts for the worsening AQI in Mumbai ? Meteorological conditions play a role in pollution . But it should be clear that the weather or climate can not generate air pollution . Air quality deteriorates mainly due to anthropogenic sources of emissions , whether local or distant . Meteorological conditions only help to manoeuvre the pollutants in the Mumbai geography gives it a distinct ? The usual is becoming unusual and getting triggered by additional anthropogenic the reasons for Mumbai pollution Do You Know Last winter , the city experienced record breaking particulate pollution , which was largely related to the unusual triple dip La Nina conditions understood as linked to climate change . An abnormal drop in surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean had a telling effect on coastal wind speeds around Mumbai . There was scarcely any wind reversal from across the Arabian Sea , which would otherwise occur every two to three days and disperse pollutants in the air . In other words , the emission from various anthropogenic sources was not cleaned up and the city experienced its worst air of the decade . La Nina has gone this year . However , the withdrawal of the monsoon was delayed till October . The withdrawal time of monsoon always plays a critical role in Mumbai air quality . The withdrawal is always followed by an anticyclonic circulation that was right above Mumbai and the surrounding regions during the initial days of October . This led to weak ventilation in the city . At the same time , the transport level winds , much above the surface in the atmosphere , were moderately fast and were blowing towards Mumbai from Lonavala and Khandala in the Sahyadri ranges , around ft above sea level . These chilly moderate winds are capable of transporting pollutants towards Mumbai . When these winds started losing energy , they descended near Navi Mumbai and the surrounding coastal region . There they encountered warmer winds which were laden with local dust . When this dust filled cloud pushed towards Mumbai , it was arrested because of the calm winds , deteriorating the city air quality . The fact that continues to be the major pollutant in the city and the visibility of Mumbai residents has been impacted suggests that the major blame for the current worsening of air quality should be ascribed to coarser particles , largely a result of dust emissions . Many development and construction activities are being undertaken across the city these include the coastal corridor , work on the Metro and other digging activities . Unfavourable weather conditions exploit the emissions from such sources to create pollution . Under normal conditions , windblown dust contributes 26 per cent of and 19 per cent in . However , the spike in pollution indicates that levels have gone up significantly . Under normal conditions , the transport sector contributes to 14 per cent of and 31 per cent of . However , the stagnating conditions are likely to have caused a change in this mix . What is the AQI and how does it calculate pollution ? What is PM particulate matter with a diameter of micrometres and PM 10 particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers ?

Syllabus : Preliminary Examination : Current events of national and international importance . Main Examination : General Studies II : Effect of policies and politics of developed and developing countries on India interests . Key Points to Ponder : What the ongoing story On Monday October 23 , the yield on 10 year government bonds in the US , the benchmark for asset prices across the globe , rose to hit per cent , its highest level since July 2007 . Though the yield came down to per cent later in the day , the rise capped a multi week rout in bond prices as investors bet that the US Federal Reserve would keep interest rates at their current high levels for longer amid concerns over inflation spiking again due to high energy process . In India , the yield on 10 year government bonds is already at a high of per cent , a rise on 24 basis points in the last one month . What bond yield ? For Your Information A bond is a type of loan made by an investor to a borrower a company or an institution for a fixed period of time in return for regular interest payments . The yield on bond is the return an investor expects to receive each year over its term to maturity . For the investor who has purchased the bond , the bond yield is a summary of the overall return that accounts for the remaining interest payments and principal they will receive , relative to the price of the bond . The prices at which investors buy and sell bonds in the secondary market move in the opposite direction to the yields . Rising bond yields could also have a cascading negative impact on equities . Why yields are high ? What does it mean ? For Your Information Historically , it was observed the bond yields in other countries , including India , rose when US yields showed any uptrend and vice versa . However , the quantum of increase varies depending on domestic factors . India 10 year yield rose by 162 basis points from per cent July 10 , 2020 while US yields jumped by 400 bps to per cent . The rise indicates that the cost of funds in the financial system is rising and interest rates are on the upswing . The rising bond yield means the government will have to pay more as yield or return to the investors , leading to a rise in cost of borrowings . This will have an overall impact on the financial system , putting upwards pressure on the general interest rates in the banking system . Analysts say that rising yields hint at expectations of sticky and higher inflation coupled with possibilities of a rate hike or status quo on interest rates . US Fed has hiked interest rates by 500 basis points from per cent to per cent since May 2022 . In short , rising yields put severe pressure on an upward movement in interest rates . Rising yields can also trigger a flight of capital from bank fixed deposits to sovereign guaranteed bonds as the differential in yields widen . What the impact on bond investors ?

The striking women were joined by the Prime Minister , Katrin Jakobsdóttir . For 14 years in a row , Iceland has topped the World Economic Forum global gender gap rankings . Map Work Iceland Why are women striking ? Do You Know Iceland is a European island nation located in the North Atlantic Ocean , with a population of less than 4 lakh . Its women have made great strides in terms of representation in the workforce and legislation backing their right to equality . Many of these benefits came after a nationwide women day off observed on October 24 , 1975 . However , 48 years on , two key areas of concern remain pay gap and gender based violence . According to a report in The Guardian , in some professions Icelandic women still earn 21 less than men , and more than 40 of women have experienced gender based or sexual violence . We seeking to bring attention to the fact that we called an equality paradise , but there are still gender disparities and urgent need for action , said Freyja Steingrímsdóttir , a strike organiser and the communications director for the Icelandic Federation for Public Workers . Who is striking ? What led to this strike ? What was the 1975 strike ? For Your Information Since 1975 , women have staged several hours long strikes , but this is the first full day action . The 1975 day off saw the participation of almost 90 of the island working women . According to The NYT , schools and theaters were shut , and the national airline had to cancel flights as most of the flight attendants were women . A BBC report said , Banks , factories and some shops had to close , as did schools and nurseries leaving many fathers with no choice but to take their children to work . There were reports of men arming themselves with sweets and colouring pencils to entertain the crowds of overexcited children in their workplaces . Sausages easy to cook and popular with children were in such demand the shops sold out . A year later , in 1976 , Iceland passed a law granting equal rights irrespective of gender .

              " 'Are War Crimes Being Committed in Israel Hamas War and How International Law Applies to Conflicts The fighting in Gaza , that has been raging for 20 days , following surprise attack by Hamas on Israel has shocked the world . Ever since the October 7 attack , Gaza Hamas run health ministry says more than Palestinians have been killed by Israel relentless retaliatory bombardments , mostly civilians and many of them children . However , the capture of hostages by Hamas , Israel use of phosphorus bombs and the cutting of food , water and electricity in Gaza have pointed out to the war crimes that are being done on the pretext of the conflict . While both Israel and Hamas have been accused of breaking international law during their latest conflict , the terms crime against humanity and war crimes can only be used under defined scenarios . Here is all you need to know about what are war crimes and crime against humanity and have Israel and Gaza committed war crimes in the Israel Gaza conflict : WHAT ARE THE RULES OF WAR ? The international humanitarian laws during wars and conflicts are defined by the Geneva Conventions , drawn up after World War II and agreed on by almost every nation . The four conventions agreed upon in 1949 set out that civilians , the wounded and prisoners must be treated humanely in wartime . They ban murder , torture , hostage taking and humiliating and degrading treatment and require fighters to treat the other side sick and wounded . Another set of rules in the law of war is the founding Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ICC . Set up in 2002 , the ICC is the only global independent tribunal to probe the world worst crimes including genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . The ICC defines war crimes as acts including intentional attacks on civilians , civilian settlements or humanitarian workers , destroying property where not militarily necessary , sexual violence and unlawful deportation . Other agreements ban certain types of weapons , such as chemical or biological munitions . But not all countries have signed up to these . How are War crimes Defined ? War crimes and crimes against humanity were both defined in the 1998 Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court . A war crime is a serious violation of international law against civilians and combatants during armed conflict , a grave breach of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that established a legal framework for war after the Nuremberg tribunals of top Nazis . It covers more than 50 scenarios , including killing , torture , rape and hostage taking . It also includes deliberate attacks on undefended population centres that are not military objectives . A crime against humanity is defined as a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population including murder and extermination as well as enslavement and deportation or forcible transfer . HAS HAMAS COMMITTED WAR CRIMES ? Hamas , by firing thousands of rockets at Israeli towns and cities on October 7 and sending hundreds of gunmen across the border from Gaza has committed war crimes , experts have said . Haim Abraham , a lecturer in law at University College London , said the evidence of crimes is clear . They massacred civilians at their homes . They kidnapped civilians , taking them hostage . All of these things are clearly war crimes , Abraham said , according to AP . It has also violated international law by taking hostages after a surprise attack . Israel has said Hamas has taken around 150 hostages , including Americans , Germans , Mexicans and Thais . Jeanne Sulzer , a lawyer with the Commission for International Justice of Amnesty International France , said the Geneva Conventions state that civilians should never be taken hostage . If they are , that may be characterized as a war crime . Palestine is a state party of the Rome Statute of the ICC , which means that Hamas leaders and personnel can be held accountable for committing genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes if they are held guilty . HAS ISRAEL RETALIATION BEEN LEGAL ? The Israeli military while attacking Gaza with airstrikes and missiles , also blocked deliveries of food , water , fuel , electricity and other essentials , collectively punishing 2 million Palestinians in Gaza . United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk has already said that such a siege depriving civilians of goods required for survival is illegal under international humanitarian law . The Geneva based International Committee of the Red Cross has said the instruction for hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes , coupled with the complete siege explicitly denying them food , water , and electricity , are not compatible with international humanitarian law . Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of using munitions containing white phosphorus . The incendiary substance is not banned , but its use in densely populated areas has been widely condemned . Both Hamas and Israel have been indiscriminately bombing each other which also constitutes a war crime , as it is not just targeting military personnel , according to Melanie , visiting professor in international law at the University of Minnesota . CAN LAWBREAKERS BE HELD TO ACCOUNT ? The International Criminal Court has the power to prosecute nations officials for violations and order compensation for victims . But some countries including the United States , Russia and Israel do not recognize the court jurisdiction , and the ICC does not have a police force to execute arrest warrants . While the ICC is the only permanent international tribunal set up to prosecute war crimes , other international courts including the International Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights can hear cases related to alleged violations . Amnesty International , which is also investigating Israeli attacks in Gaza , points to evidences of war crimes in Israeli attacks . Our research points to damning evidence of war crimes in Israel bombing campaign that must be urgently investigated . Decades of impunity and injustice and the unprecedented level of death and destruction of the current offensive will only result in further violence and instability in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories , Agnès Callamard , Amnesty International Secretary General said . In 2021 , prosecutors at the ICC opened a formal investigation into the Palestinian territories , including alleged crimes by Israeli forces and by Hamas and Palestinian armed groups . Israel , which is not a member of the ICC , has refused to recognise its jurisdiction or cooperate with the probe , which covers possible crimes going back to the 2014 war in Gaza . The court has said only that its mandate to investigate crimes going back to 2014 is ongoing and would also apply to any alleged crimes committed during the current war .

              " 'Gaza Between occupation and the deep blue sea October 22 , 2023 am Updated am IST When the state of Israel was declared in May 1948 in Palestine , five Arab countries attacked the newly created state , launching the first Arab Israeli war . In the subsequent months , some Arabs from Palestine , mostly from areas that became part of the Jewish state , were uprooted from their homes . Most of them took refuge in Gaza , a tiny Mediterranean strip of land , and the West Bank , the land on the western bank of the Jordan River . As refugees started flowing into Gaza , the 356 sq . km territory saw its population swelling to over within months . In the war , Israel captured more Palestinian territories than what the UN partition plan had envisaged for a Jewish state . Jordan seized the West Bank and East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip fell into the hands of Egypt . Also read : Will Israel Gaza offensive stop Hamas ? Explained The people of Gaza , who lived under Ottoman rule for centuries and British occupation for decades subsequently , would continue to see their fate being determined by colonisers . Israel would capture the enclave in 1967 and keep it under its control , either through direct military occupation or blockades . Gaza has remained a flashpoint ever since , with occasional bouts of violence . The latest in this episode was the October 7 Sabbath attack by Hamas , the Islamist militants who control Gaza today , that killed at least Israelis , mostly civilians . In retaliation , Israel has launched a massive bombing campaign , already killing some people , and is now preparing for a ground invasion . History of Gaza When Palestine was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in the century , it was divided into six administrative districts . Gaza Sanjak District of Gaza was one of them , stretching from Jaffa in the north now part of Israel to Rafah now , the border crossing with Egypt in the south . For over four centuries , it remained an Ottoman district of Palestine . From the early century , Jews , fleeing discrimination in Europe , had started migrating to Palestine . In 1917 , during the last leg of the First World War , the British captured Palestine , including Gaza , from a crumbling Ottoman Empire . In the same year , the British had promised to support the creation of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine . After the war , Palestine , comprising today Israel , West Bank and Gaza , became a British colony . Jewish migration to British ruled Palestine would pick up pace during the interwar period . This would lead to Arab Jewish violent riots in the . Also read : Why did Hamas launch a surprise attack on Israel ? Analysis By the time the Second World War was over , Jews had become a sizeable community in Palestine with a parallel administration , the Jewish Agency , and their own militia groups Haganah and Irgun . Britain approached the UN , declaring its intent to vacate the mandate . The UN partition plan divide Palestine into an Arab state , a Jewish state and an international city of Jerusalem was rejected outright by the Arabs . In 1948 , just before the British mandate ended , Zionists unilaterally declared the state of Israel , which triggered the 1948 war . Under the Israeli occupation , there were two different streams of Palestinian movements the secular nationalism championed by Fatah and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation PLO , and the Islamist awakening promoted by the Muslim Brotherhood . In Gaza , the Brothers had established deep roots . In both Palestinian territories the West Bank , including East Jerusalem and Gaza , public anger was building up against Israel occupation . And Gaza played a major part in the outbreak of the first intifada uprising against the occupation . On December 8 , 1987 , several Palestinians were killed in a traffic incident in Gaza , involving an Israeli driver , which immediately led to a wave of protests , which spread to the West Bank . The PLO called for a mass uprising . A year later , Hamas was established . The intifada would eventually lead to the Oslo Accords of 1993 which saw a provisional authority the Palestinian Authority being formed with limited powers in certain parts of the West Bank and Gaza . But the real promise of the Oslo process was Palestinian statehood . That would collapse in the as Israel would accuse the Palestinians of reneging on the security promises they made and walk back from its own promises . Hamas , which opposed the Oslo Accords , would continue to carry out attacks against the Israelis during this period . Oslo Accord failure led to the second intifada in 2000 . Both Gaza and the West Bank erupted in violence , and this time , Hamas was in the driving seat . From the , Israel had promoted Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza . In 2005 , faced with Hamas violent resistance , Israel unilaterally decided to pull back its troops and settlers from Gaza . For the first time in centuries , Palestinians got a chance to establish their own rule in the enclave , even though Israel direct occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem continued . In the first elections held in the Palestinian territories , in 2006 , Hamas came to power , defeating Fatah . The Islamists and the secularists initially formed a unity government . But it would fall apart quickly , particularly after Western countries refused to sanction funds to the Palestinian Authority led by Hamas , which they see as a terrorist outfit . A brief Fatah Hamas civil war would break out . Fatah ousted Hamas from the West Bank and the latter captured Gaza in 2007 . Ever since , Hamas has been the government in Gaza . But for Israel , Hamas , which it has designated as a terrorist outfit , taking over Gaza was a security challenge . Hamas did not see Israel withdrawal from Gaza , which is only a part of Palestine , as an end of its conflict with Israel . It said it retained the right to resist as long as Israel continued the occupation of Palestinian territories . On the other side , Israel imposed a land , air and naval blockade on Gaza from 2007 onwards , to control what and who go in and out of the enclave . Constant tensions led to occasional wars . Since 2007 , there have been four major conflicts between Israel and Hamas in which thousands of Palestinians and hundreds of Israelis were killed . Largest open prison Gaza is often described as the world largest open prison . Its population has ballooned to million , making it one of the most densely populated regions . Israel has built barriers along the border both overland and underground with limited checkpoints . It issues a limited number of permits to the Gazans to get out of the enclave . The unemployment rate in Gaza is roughly 47 it is 70 among the young . Electricity is scarce eight hour power cuts are common . Israel has destroyed Gaza only airport and restrained access for the Gazans to the Mediterranean Sea . The enclave economy is mostly run on contributions from abroad . Over the years , Israel has built a security model based on keeping Palestine organised resistance under check using force , money , checkpoints , barriers and blockades . In the past , Israel had seen Hamas and the Islamic Jihad , another Islamist group operating from Gaza , launching rockets into Israel in protest against its highhandedness in the West Bank , including raids at the al Aqsa compound in East Jerusalem . But on October 7 , Hamas launched an unexpected ground invasion into Israel something which has happened since 1948 . The attack from Gaza shattered Israel security model and brought the Palestine question , which has been sidelined by both Israel and Arab powers , back to the fore of West Asia . To rebuild its deterrence , Israel is now showering fire and fury on the whole of Gaza .',\n",
              " 'Jewish students barricade inside Cooper Union library as pro Palestinian protesters bang on doors In a harrowing incident at the Cooper Union college in New York , Jewish students found themselves barricaded inside the university library as pro Palestinian protesters bypassed security and aggressively banged on the building doors . The protesters , displaying anti Zionist posters and shouting what was described as \" anti Semitic rhetoric , \" created a scene of chaos and fear . A Jewish senior from the East Village institution vividly described the terrifying ordeal . As the demonstrators slammed posters against the window and began pounding on the door , she felt an overwhelming sense of dread . \" When they started banging on the door , my heart started pounding . I was crying . I think if the doors were locked I do know what would have happened , she confided to The New York Post , choosing to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the situation . The protesters , armed with Palestinian flags and signs reading \" Zionism Hands off our Universities , \" had initially planned a 1 demonstration outside the building . However , they unexpectedly decided to move inside . Their initial trajectory seemed to be towards the office of university President Laura Sparks , presumably to demand a condemnation of Israel actions in Gaza . But they suddenly changed direction towards the library . We have been in contact with the NYPD and Cooper Union leadership about the situation that unfolded on campus . The NYPD was present on scene and was coordinating with school security during the entire event , ensuring no one was injured , New York City Mayor Eric Adams said on X , formerly known as Twitter . While the students at Cooper Union have a right to peacefully protest , hate has no place in our city , Adams added . Videos from the scene show the group , chanting \" Free Palestine , \" effortlessly moving past security and ascending the stairs . Security personnel on the library level managed to lock the doors in time , preventing the protesters from entering . However , this did deter them from banging on the walls and continuing their chants . Several of the 11 Jewish students trapped inside the library reached out to 911 or contacted family members who then called the police . Although the NYPD was present at the demonstration , no arrests or summonses were made , and the protesters eventually left the building without any further incidents , the Post report said . The witness claimed that the police never arrived on the scene because the university advised against their involvement . Instead , a school administrator offered to discreetly escort the students out of the building back entrance . After the protest , some Jewish students decided to remain inside the library . When they eventually emerged , they were met with a silent display of pro Palestinian demonstrators showcasing their signs . Kim Newman , the university media relations manager , said that the library was temporarily closed for about 20 minutes during the protest .

The Hamas official statement contradicts the ground reality of October 7 attack , in which Hamas fighters paraglided into Israel , ransacked a music festival , slaughtered 260 attendees and maimed several others . Screengrab from the interview of Hamas spokesperson Ghazi Following that attack , video clips and images have emerged of deadly assault on Israeli citizens who were killed in their beds , leaving bodies drenched in pools of blood to rot . Defending his statement , Hamad told the correspondent that because the area was very wide there were clashes and confrontation . The correspondent asserted by saying it was not a confrontation when the fighters invaded houses and killed people when they were sleeping . Hamad said , I can tell you we did have any intention or decision to kill the civilians .

              " 'Israel Army Is Ready to Invade Gaza . Its Divided Government May Not Be . Its troops are massed on the Gaza border and described as ready to move , but Israel political and military leaders are divided about how , when and even whether to invade , according to seven senior military officers and three Israeli officials . In part , they say , the delay is intended to give negotiators more time to try to secure the release of some of the more than 200 hostages captured by Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups when they raided Israel three weeks ago . But Israeli leaders , who have vowed to retaliate against Hamas for its brutal massacre of civilians , have yet to agree on how to do so , though the military could move as soon as Friday . Some of them worry that an invasion might suck the Israeli Army into an intractable urban battle inside Gaza . Others fear a broader conflict , with a Lebanese militia allied to Hamas , Hezbollah , firing long range missiles toward Israeli cities . There is also debate over whether to conduct the invasion through one large operation or a series of smaller ones . And then there are questions about who would govern Gaza if Israel captured it . You have a cabinet with different opinions , said Danny Danon , a senior lawmaker from Likud , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu right wing party . Some would say that we have to start then we can think about the next stage , said Danon , a member of the foreign affairs and defense committee in the Israeli Parliament . But we as the leadership , as statesmen , we have to set the goals , and the goals should be very clear , he said . It should be vague .',\n",

Since the October 7 attack , Israel has been bombarding Gaza , in which more than Palestinians have been killed . The Israeli military has also mounted an incursion deeper into Gaza on Friday as it readies for a ground offensive against Hamas . However , one of the biggest challenges the Israeli troops face is an extensive Hamas tunnel network , where the group is said to have taken several hostages . Hamas reportedly has different kinds of tunnels hundreds of kilometres long and up to 80 metres deep running beneath the sandy 360 sq km coastal strip and its borders . Sponge bombs create sudden explosion of foam In order to fight Hamas through its tunnel network , Israel is reportedly making \" sponge bombs \" , which create a sudden explosion of foam that rapidly expands and then hardens . According to a report in The Telegraph , Israel has been testing the chemical grenades , which contain no explosives but are used to seal off gaps or tunnel entrances from which Hamas operatives may emerge . Advertisement These devices are said to be encased within a protective plastic container that has a metal barrier that divides two distinct liquids . When activated , these liquids merge and advance toward their intended destination . The Israel Defense Forces IDF were seen deploying these devices during exercises in a mock tunnel system near the Gaza border in 2021 . Advertisement Among the elite units tasked with going underground is Yahalom , specialist commandos from Israel Combat Engineering Corps known as the \" weasels \" , who specialise in finding , clearing , and destroying the tunnels . How Hamas built its tunnel network Hamas was created in Gaza in 1987 and reportedly started digging tunnels in the . The tunnel network is a key reason why Hamas is stronger in Gaza than in the Israeli occupied West Bank .',\n",

Advertisement The IDF has for several weeks been preparing a full scale incursion aimed at rooting out the Gaza ruling terror group following its murderous October 7 onslaught in southern Israel . It has pounded the Strip on an unprecedented scale in order to eliminate potential threats to ground troops once the order finally comes . The airstrikes have flattened entire neighborhoods , causing a level of destruction unseen in the last four wars between Israel and Hamas . The IDF said Friday that over the past day , it has carried out more than 250 airstrikes against Hamas sites in the Gaza Strip , with targets including Hamas tunnels , command centers , rocket launching positions , and dozens of operatives . חיסלו הלילה את מדחת מבאשר , מפקד גדוד מערב חאן יונס בארגון הטרור חמאס . מדחת לקח חלק בפיגועי צליפה ומטענים גדולים לעבר כוחות ולעבר יישובי ישראל . כמו כן , ביממה האחרונה תקף מעל מטרות של ארגון הטרור חמאס ברצועת עזה , ביניהן , מנהרות טרור , עשרות מחבלים דובר דניאל הגרי Daniel Hagari October 27 , 2023 The military also confirmed a Skylark 3 drone crashed in the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City earlier Friday , as a result of a technical error , but said there was no fear of sensitive information leaking from the device . Also Friday , the military said that at least 233 hostages were kidnapped and taken to the Gaza Strip during the devastating assault on October 7 . Advertisement IDF spokesman Rear Daniel Hagari said the military has notified the families of 229 hostages that their loved ones are currently being held in the enclave . The number does not include four released hostages mother and daughter Judith and Natalie , who were freed a week ago , and elderly women Yocheved Lifshitz and Nurit Cooper , freed on Monday night . Hagari said the number is not final as the military continues to investigate new information . However , a member of a Hamas delegation visiting Russia claimed that the terror group still does not know where all the people kidnapped by Palestinian terrorists during their attack are being held . The Hamas official , named as Abu Hamid , claimed in an interview with Russia semi official Kommersant news outlet that the terror group has always been willing to release civilians , but needs time to find them . He additionally claimed members of various groups are holding hostages , and that a ceasefire was needed to allow Hamas to carry out its search , find the hostages and then release them . The updated hostage figures from the military came after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday promised to make every effort to return the hostages as he reiterated that a ground operation was looming and vowed to win the war , asserting that the country next 75 years largely depend on it . In a primetime televised address , the defense minister said : We are in decisive moments . This is a war for our home and we will win it . It either us or them . Advertisement Gallant said again that the planned ground offensive will occur soon . Additional stages in the war will also come , we are creating the conditions for them and we will carry them out . I am determined to ensure the State of Israel is victorious over this tough and evil enemy over this epitome of evil . Nothing like this has happened in Israel 75 years of existence , he continued , referring to the scale of the carnage and destruction , and the number of abducted Israelis . What will happen in the next 75 years depends largely on the achievements in this battle . On Wednesday , The New York Times reported that Israel had agreed to a request from the United States to temporarily delay the planned Gaza ground incursion to give Washington more time to deploy additional air defense systems to protect its troops in the region . The US was also reportedly concerned that Israel lacks achievable military goals for its operations in Gaza , leading to fears that the IDF is not yet ready for a ground incursion . The campaign is also understood to have been postponed to allow for extensive internationally brokered negotiations with Hamas over the potential release of hundreds of Israeli and foreign hostages it is holding . The negotiations have also resulted in a trickle of humanitarian aid entering Gaza for its besieged and devastated civilian population . Led by Hamas and carried out with other terror groups , the October 7 assault saw some terrorists burst across the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip by land , air and sea , killing some people and seizing more than 230 hostages of all ages , under the cover of thousands of rockets fired at Israeli towns and cities . Israel says its war against Hamas is aimed at destroying the Iran backed terror group infrastructure and has vowed to dismantle the organization after the massacres while minimizing harm to Gaza civilians . The IDF has been calling on Palestinians to evacuate from northern Gaza southward , as it intensifies strikes in the Gaza City area . An airstrike on Thursday killed the deputy head of Hamas intelligence directorate , Shadi Barud , the military said . The IDF accused Barud of planning the October 7 massacre along with Hamas leader in Gaza , Yahya Sinwar . Barud previously served as a battalion commander in the Khan Younis area and held other roles in the terror group intelligence directorate , and was responsible for planning numerous terror attacks against Israeli civilians , the IDF said . Another strike killed the head of Hamas North Khan Younis rocket array , Hassan al Abdullah , according to the army , which added that fighter jets had struck and killed several more Hamas members and destroyed several sites belonging to the terror group throughout the day . And in the evening , the military said it had killed three senior commanders in Hamas Daraj Tuffah Battalion : the battalion commander , Rifaat Abbas ; the deputy commander , Ibrahim Jadba ; and a combat support commander , Tarek Maarouf . According to the IDF , the Daraj Tuffah Battalion is part of Hamas Gaza City Brigade , which is considered the most significant brigade of the Hamas terrorist organization . Israeli Air Force sources say that more than sites belonging to Hamas and other terror groups have been struck since the beginning of the war . Gaza Hamas run health ministry says the strikes have killed over people , many of them children . The figures issued by the terror group can not be independently verified , and are believed to include its own terrorists and gunmen killed in Israel and in Gaza , and the victims of what Israel says are hundreds of errant Palestinian rockets that have landed in the Strip since the war began . Israel says it killed Hamas terrorists inside Israel on and after October 7 . On Thursday , Hamas released a list of almost names of people it said had been killed in Israeli strikes , after US President Joe Biden cast doubt on the toll issued by the terror group controlled Gaza health ministry . That list too could not be independently verified . The death toll on both sides is expected to rise significantly once Israel launches its ground offensive and begins entering Gazan cities . Troops are expected to have to contend with Gaza network of tunnels dug by terror groups , booby traps and bombs , as they battle through tough urban environments . Friday also additional barrages of rocket fire from Gaza toward central and southern Israel . One rocket struck the top two floors of an apartment building in Tel Aviv , injuring four people . Each of them was evacuated to nearby hospitals two men , 53 and 20 , were moderately wounded from shrapnel and two men , 78 and 52 , were lightly wounded from smoke inhalation . The Hamas al Qassam Brigades claimed responsibility for the barrages , saying in a statement that they were in response to Zionist massacres against civilians , it said .

              " 'IDF says apparent drone strike on Egypt town near Israel launched from Red Sea area IDF Spokesman Rear Daniel Hagari said Friday that a strike in the Egyptian Red Sea town of Taba in the early hours of the morning originated from the Red Sea area , in an apparent reference to Iran backed Houthi rebels in Yemen . Taba sits on the border with Israel and is some 10 kilometers six miles , from the southern city of Eilat . The Al Arabiya broadcaster quoted an Egyptian military spokesman who said the strike was caused by a drone . In the last few hours , an aerial threat was detected in the Red Sea area . Fighter jets were scrambled to the threat and the issue is under investigation , Hagari said . To our understanding , the impact in Egypt originates from this threat . Israel will work together with Egypt and the US and tighten the defense against threats from the Red Sea area , he added .

Watch : A missile strike hits a medical facility in the Egyptian Red Sea town of Taba near Israeli border , injuring at least six people , local reports say . Read more : Advertisement Al Arabiya English October 27 , 2023 Al Qahera news , which has close ties to Egypt intelligence service , said the strike hit a medical facility where ambulances were parked and a hospital administration building . All six people had minor injuries and were being treated at a hospital , Egypt Health Ministry said . An unnamed security source cited by al Qahera said Egypt reserved the right to respond to the attack . Once the origin of the launch is determined , all options are available , he added . Meanwhile , two Egyptian security sources told the Reuters news agency that a projectile also fell in the Red Sea town of Nuweiba . Advertisement It was unclear whether the impact was the result of an interception . The sources said authorities were still gathering more information on the incident . The Egypt blasts came days after the Iran backed Houthi rebels in Yemen attempted to fire missiles at Israel via the Red Sea . Last week , the Pentagon announced that a US Navy warship intercepted three missiles that were heading north and had been fired by Iranian backed Houthi rebels in Yemen , and that they may have been aimed at Israel . US officials said the USS Carney , a Navy destroyer , was in the Red Sea and intercepted the three missiles . Unnamed Israeli officials told Hebrew language media that the missiles were fired in the direction of Israel . In addition to the Houthi threat , last year year National Unity leader Benny Gantz , a member of the war cabinet , warned that Iran maritime activity in the Red Sea was its most significant in a decade . Iran is expanding its activities in the maritime arena . Over the last year , Iran has seized international tankers and attacked vessels . Today , we can confirm that Iran is methodically basing itself in the Red Sea , with warships patrolling the southern region , Gantz told the Economist Government Roundtable conference held in Greece . Hagari said last week that the Israeli military was prepared to protect against potential attacks by the Iran backed Houthis . Advertisement This shows the defense capabilities of the US , and their ability to build a picture of the region , Hagari said shortly after the attack , noting the close relationship the IDF has with the US Central Command . Israel has some of the world best air defenses , and is prepared for threats like these , he added . Houthi rebels have expressed support for the Palestinians and threatened Israel amid the Israel Hamas war . The Iranian backed group slogan is Death to America , Death to Israel , Curse the Jews , Victory to Islam . Iran has warned repeatedly that Israel could face wider threats if it does not halt its war against Gazan terrorists , launched after Hamas October 7 terrorist rampage through southern Israel , in which Israelis were killed , mainly civilians . Israel has repeatedly accused Iran of being a key force behind the coordinated Hamas attack on Israel , in which it succeeded in disabling the high tech Gaza border fence with its terrorists streaming across the border to carry out a devastating assault on nearby communities , which included taking at least 230 people hostage . Israel says its war against Hamas is aimed at destroying the Iran backed terror group infrastructure and has vowed to dismantle the organization after the October 7 massacres , while minimizing harm to Gaza civilians . Amid concerns that the war could expand with the involvement of Iran and its proxies , including the Lebanon based Hezbollah terror group , Tehran has repeatedly threatened Israel that the region could spiral out of control if the war in Gaza continues . Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said Sunday that he warned the US and its proxy Israel that if they do not immediately stop the crime against humanity and genocide in Gaza , anything is possible at any moment and the region will become out of control .

              " 'Israeli tech workers bring innovation , AI to search for hostages held in Gaza It looks like any other scrappy Tel Aviv tech startup , with staff in hip clothing huddled around laptops and downing espressos , but they are the volunteers in a war room assembled to help Israel bring home the hostages . Gunmen from the Hamas terror group seized more than 220 people when they stormed across Gaza border with Israel on October 7 and killed more than people . Within days , volunteers from Israel thriving tech sector teamed up to lend a hand in the hostage crisis . We are a civilian war room . Our main purpose is to save lives , said Refael Franco , 48 , the chief executive of Code Blue , a cyber crisis management firm leading the effort at Gitam BBDO communications group in Tel Aviv . We collect . We compare .

Sign up for the Tech Israel Daily and never miss Israel top tech stories Newsletter email address Subscribe By signing up , you agree to the terms For years , Israel tech sector has emerged as a formative pillar underpinning the country economy , with cybersecurity firms in particular serving as a powerful driver of growth and innovation . Seemingly overnight , volunteers from the sector began meeting at the Gitam group offices where they pooled their expertise with artificial intelligence and innovative platforms to assist in identifying the missing in the aftermath of the devastating Hamas attacks . In this makeshift response center , volunteers have spent days combing through the deluge of social media posts across myriad platforms to gather information about the captives . Advertisement After amassing a database of images from social media in tandem with photos provided by families of the missing and kidnapped , the team then feeds the evidence into artificial intelligence software specializing in facial recognition . With assistance from experts in geolocating , programmers , and Arabic speakers , the team has rapidly pieced together an emerging picture of who was abducted , when they were last seen and where . The information is then shared with the Israeli military special unit overseeing the hostage crisis , with around 60 captives successfully identified by the team to date . Mobilization The tech community reaction to the hostage crisis represents just a microcosm of the sweeping mobilization happening across Israel , with the young and old volunteering en masse to support affected families , soldiers and a range of other response efforts after the October 7 attacks . The hostage crisis has been particularly haunting . Amid the trauma unleashed by the Hamas massacre , the hostage crisis remains an open wound , fueling anxiety and uncertainty during what Israeli leaders say will be a long war with the terror group . Advertisement People here left their jobs . There are CEOs and CTOs and founders of companies that put everything aside and just came here to help , said Ido Brosh , a 24 year old volunteer programmer at Gitam BBDO with expertise in military intelligence . It horrible that this event made us so unified , but that also the beauty of this country . In times of crisis , we come together . But even as the tech community pools its resources to help with the hostage response , the agony for the families of those held captive remains excruciating . For 82 year old Holocaust survivor Tsili Wenkert , the abduction of her grandson , Omer Weknert , from a music festival in southern Israel near the border with Gaza has brought an unending torrent of pain . What I been through in the past is small . I now living through a nightmare , she told AFP . It very hard for a grandmother at my age to know her grandson is a captive . The 22 year old was last seen in footage posted on a Hamas linked Telegram channel , showing him stripped to his underwear and bound in the back of a truck filled with armed terrorists , celebrating as they returned to Gaza . Bring her back Just four hostages have been released to date . Advertisement Yocheved Lifshitz , 85 , was among those freed . Following her release this week , she told reporters from a wheelchair of the hell they went through as her community was attacked , and that she was led through a spiderweb of tunnels under Gaza , where she was held with other captives . The presence of the hostages will likely complicate the widely anticipated ground offensive by the Israeli army following weeks of airstrikes across the Gaza Strip , with Israel reportedly agreeing to a request from the United States to temporarily delay its planned ground incursion into Gaza to give Washington more time to deploy additional air defense systems to protect its troops in the region , as well as to allow the ongoing efforts to secure the release of the hostages , many of whom hold dual citizenships . But even amid the exhaustion and trauma triggered by the October 7 attacks , the ongoing hostage crisis has stirred resolve in many . For Omri Marcus , a creative director working on a campaign to battle misinformation at Gitam BBDO , the project is personal . Marcus pointed to the wallpaper image on his laptop a picture of his best friend cousin who is among the kidnapped . The photo , he said , serves as a constant reminder of the mission at hand .

Sign up to get the rest free , including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know , sent to your inbox every weekday . Wp Get the full experience . Choose your plan ArrowRight In the grim aftermath of Hamas 7 attack on Israel , a slogan spread . Hamas is ISIS , declared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , linking the grotesque slaughter carried out by the Palestinian faction militants to the ravages of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria almost a decade prior . The latter driven by an apocalyptic , millenarian creed had embarked on a frenzy of killing , torture , grisly execution and abductions of civilians from communities of supposed apostates and enemies . The reports of what Hamas fighters did across towns and kibbutzim in southern Israel recalled the cruelty and savagery of the Islamic State rampage . And , in the Israeli view , it merited an equivalent response . Just as the forces of civilization united to defeat ISIS , the forces of civilization must support Israel in defeating Hamas , Netanyahu said . Advertisement The refrain became a hashtag , and has been echoed by Israeli officials and politicians across the spectrum , as well as by Israel allies . A week after the massacres , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin described what Hamas did as worse than ISIS . On Tuesday , French President Emmanuel Macron appeared alongside Netanyahu and took the analogy further , suggesting that an international coalition the likes of which fought al Qaeda and the Islamic State should now defeat Israel quarry . He said that Israel was not alone and that France is ready for the coalition , which is fighting in Iraq and Syria against ISIS , to also fight against Hamas . What that means in practice is still unclear . Israel is preparing for the next phase of its offensive against Hamas , which Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said on Tuesday must be erased off the face of the planet . Relentless Israeli bombardments of the besieged Gaza Strip killed Palestinians and compounded an already devastating humanitarian crisis . Meanwhile , the United States has rushed aid and military assets to the region . Along with European allies , the Biden administration is attempting to tamp down the possibility of the conflict turning into Middle East conflagration . Given the scale and horror of Hamas carnage , the invocation of ISIS is not surprising . 7 marked the single bloodiest day in Israeli history , and the bloodiest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust . More than two weeks later , journalists are still learning more grisly details from Israeli authorities of how Hamas militants butchered toddlers and babies , raped women and incinerated terrified civilians in their homes . Israeli officials have vowed a merciless campaign of retribution against human animals and framed their actions , which have led to soaring Palestinian civilian death tolls , in the same moral light as battles against Nazis , let alone the global campaign to defeat the Islamic State . Advertisement But scholars of the Middle East contend that such rhetoric deliberately flattens the deep forces at play . Saying there no distinction between Hamas and the Islamic State is an effective tactic to paint it and all Gazans , given many Israeli leaders generalizing language as inhuman , irredeemably evil and therefore legitimate targets for savagery in reprisal , argued Monica Marks , a professor of Middle East politics at New York University Abu Dhabi campus . She added that Hamas Islamist character and theological convictions were arguably less important than its self styled vision of being the armed standard bearer of Palestinian national liberation . Share this article Share Itzchak Weismann , an Israeli historian of Islamist movements at the University of Haifa , concurred . There a tendency to say that Hamas was always ISIS . But that not necessarily true . It an organization that responds to the situation , he told Israeli newspaper Haaretz last week , pointing to how Hamas has tolerated other religious groups in Gaza . Hamas tried to be inclusive of all of Gaza population . In contrast , ISIS would murder any Muslim who did pray at the correct time . You ca just say , ISIS slaughtered people and so did Hamas , so they the same . That very superficial . There also the small wrinkle , noted Aaron Zelin , senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , that ISIS literally views Hamas as apostates because of its ties to the Shiite theocratic regime in Iran . Israel desire to wholly eliminate Hamas may be understandable , but analysts query whether it actually possible . It would require a brutal ground war even more fraught and complicated than the effort to drive ISIS out of its redoubts in Iraq and Syria . Though chased from their so called caliphate , their ideology has hardly been expunged and ISIS offshoots proliferate in various parts of the world . Advertisement Andrew Exum , a former senior Pentagon official in the Obama administration who helped craft the anti ISIS strategy , warned of the hideous toll exacted on civilians as coalition forces recaptured the Islamic State main strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria . The human costs of recapturing Raqqa and Mosul were staggering , Exum wrote , adding that , like Gaza , too , Raqqa and Mosul are large urban areas : Avoiding large scale civilian casualties was impossible . And even if Hamas is crushed and shorn of its ability to threaten Israel with the horrific violence it unleashed on 7 , it wo address the context from which Hamas emerged and has since operated . That includes , as Secretary General António Guterres observed at the Security Council on Tuesday , more than five decades of Israeli military occupation of Palestinian territories , the predations of an Israeli settlement project emboldened by the far right government of Netanyahu , and the collapse of any political process to reckon with the absence of a Palestinian state or Palestinian political rights within Israel . For all of Israel efforts to paint it as the Palestinian branch of the Islamic State , and as reactionary and violent as it is , Hamas is an Islamic nationalist organization , not a nihilist cult , and a part of Palestinian political society ; it feeds on the despair produced by the occupation , and can not simply be liquidated any more than the fascist zealots in Netanyahu cabinet , wrote Jewish American author and critic Adam Shatz , in an essay in the London Review of Books .',\n",
              " 'Gaza kidney patients face dialysis crisis at jam packed hospitals The number of kidney dialysis patients has more than doubled at the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital , with hundreds of people now receiving reduced treatment sessions from just 24 machines . Deir el Balah , Gaza Strip Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital , the only hospital still functioning in the central Gaza Strip , reached full capacity days ago . Injured people lie on the hospital floors , medical tents and mattresses holding patients occupy the space outside the building , while dead bodies continue to arrive at the facility . Thousands of displaced Palestinians have taken refuge here , squeezing themselves in corridors and waiting rooms . Meanwhile , many patients with chronic diseases who were being treated at hospitals in the north of the besieged enclave are now at Al Aqsa Martyrs , having fled their homes after evacuation orders from the Israeli military . For kidney patients , dialysis treatment is a matter of life and death . Before the latest Israeli offensive began on October 7 , the hospital had 143 patients requiring dialysis . Now , the number of patients has more than doubled to about 300 , including 11 children who all have just 24 dialysis machines between them . Iyad Issa Abu Zaher , the hospital director general , said the facility is overwhelmed . We have resorted to rationing of all resources and medical supplies , he told Al Jazeera . A kidney dialysis patient now undergoes treatment once or twice a week for an hour or two , but before they used to come in three times a week . Even before the war , Gaza health ministry had warned that the lives of kidney failure patients , including 38 children , were at risk due to a lack of fuel and an acute shortage of the necessary medical supplies needed for dialysis . Last month , Alaa Helles , the director of the Hospital Pharmacy Department at Gaza Ministry of Health , said the territory hospitals provided dialysis sessions every month . This requires more than filters , blood collection tubes and blood cannulas per month , but since Israel and Egypt control the territory border crossings , even before the war patients were often left to wonder whether there would be enough supplies to treat them . The Gaza Strip has been under an Israeli blockade for 16 years with the movement of goods severely curtailed by Israel and Egypt . The blockade has only tightened since October 7 , following an attack by the armed wing of the Palestinian group Hamas in southern Israel . So far , only several dozen aid trucks have been allowed in a drop in the ocean in terms of the aid needed . Before the war , some 450 trucks entered daily with supplies . Breaking point Abu Zaher said the Gaza Strip healthcare system has reached a breaking point , echoing the health ministry statement on Tuesday regarding the remaining operating hospitals . Already , 12 hospitals and 32 health centres have been forced to stop functioning , the ministry statement said . And we fear that more will stop due to the Israeli targeting and the lack of fuel , it added . But keeping the doors of the remaining hospitals in the Gaza Strip open does not in itself mean these facilities are able to treat the wounded who flock to them , the statement said , saying that many medicines and medical supplies have already run out in hospitals . Abu Zaher said that without fuel , patients in operating rooms , intensive care units , babies being kept alive in incubators and others who rely on lifesaving machines are all at risk . Patients are stacked outside operating rooms as we do have enough beds , he said . Meanwhile , others recovering after operations have been moved to the outdoor tents a field hospital of sorts , he explained . But Abu Zaher also stressed that recovery for patients who have been treated is not guaranteed given that the overcrowded environment and lack of medical supplies can lead to serious infections . The outbreak of disease is inevitable , he said . There will be a humanitarian disaster after the war ends . Exhausted from this reality Manar Shreir from the Zeitoun neighbourhood in Gaza City used to go to the Al Quds Hospital for kidney dialysis . She and her family fled the intense Israeli bombardment of the city and made their way to Deir el Balah in the central Gaza Strip , where her sister lives , after the Israeli military ordered million Palestinians from the north to evacuate to the south . The Al Quds Hospital also received warnings from the Israeli military to evacuate , indicating that it could be targeted , the Palestinian Red Crescent has said . The hospital director responded to the Israeli military saying a large scale evacuation would be possible only if Israel provided buses to transport the people taking shelter at Al Quds including patients to the southern Gaza Strip and ensured a safe space for them there . The Israeli official reportedly hung up . But even those like Shreir , who have managed to make it to the south , face a struggle to get treatment . My sister house in Deir el Balah is close to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital , but I still have to queue for hours since the early morning , just waiting for my turn , said Shreir as she sits up in a hospital bed with a red blanket around her legs . Shreir has been on dialysis since 2015 , going to the hospital three times a week for four hour sessions . Now , she is lucky if she can get dialysis twice a week , for up to two and a half hours per session . It a huge difference , she said . The session is barely enough to get the toxins and accumulated fluids out of my blood . I have to watch what I eat and drink , and I barely let water pass my lips because I do want to have shortness of breath or swelling . After her last treatment , Shreir was on her way back to her sister house when Israeli air attacks hit the street parallel to the one she was on . It terrifying , she said . Even when you are in the hospital you scared . Windows have shattered before , the destruction is all around you , not to mention the horrific sound of the bombs . Inside , it not any better , with bodies of people killed piled up , blood on the floor , people missing limbs . We are exhausted from this reality . Enough criminality , enough war . Not enough Hajj Salah al Din Ahmed Suleiman Abu Iyadeh , 61 , a displaced patient from Gaza City receiving dialysis at Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital , said that without regular treatment , patients will suffer from severe fatigue and swelling . Dialysis that is two and a half hours once or twice a week is not enough , he said . These are toxins in the body which ca be allowed to stay . Right now , we are making do , but if this war continues , there will be serious problems due to the capacity and immense pressure the hospital is under . According to the health ministry , Israeli air attacks have killed Palestinians in 18 days , including children and women . More than others have been wounded . About people are trapped under rubble , including 830 children , according to the health ministry . The Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital alone has received injured people and the bodies of almost Palestinians , Abu Zaher said . Most of the casualties are men , women and children who were killed inside their own homes after an Israeli air raid targeted their building , he said . Staff at the hospital work under constant , tremendous pressure due to the overwhelming health situation as well as their personal circumstances . Some of our staff have received news that their families were targeted or killed in Israeli air attacks , he said . No hospital in the world operates like this .',\n",

A total of 704 Palestinians , including 305 children , were killed on October 24 , the Health Ministry in Hamas ruled Gaza said , a toll the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said was the highest reported in a single day since the conflict began nearly three weeks ago .

Deadly clashes have intensified between the Israeli military and Palestinians in the occupied West Bank , and resurged between Israel and Lebanon Hezbollah armed group along the Israeli Lebanon border . Iran , which has sought regional ascendancy for decades , backs both Hezbollah and Hamas , and has warned Israel to stop its onslaught on Gaza . Israel military said its jets struck Syrian army infrastructure and mortar launchers on October 25 in response to rockets launched from Iran ally Syria . The military did not provide further details . It did not accuse Syria army of firing the two rockets , which set off air raid sirens in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights .

              " 'Why India is leading the pro Israel disinformation campaign Analysis : Amid Israel ongoing bombardment of Gaza , right wing and Hindu nationalist accounts in India have surfaced on social media amplifying anti Palestinian and Islamophobic disinformation . In the wake of Israel war on Gaza , brought about by the unexpected attack by Hamas on the of October , a curious trend has emerged on social media . In the past two weeks , Indian right wing accounts many of which depict the Indian flag side by side with the Israeli one have voiced some of the most staunch support for Israel online , and are among the leading producers and amplifiers of anti Palestine disinformation . These pro Israel advocates also make their presence felt on the streets of India , where rallies are organised in support of Israel , expressing unwavering support even in the face of controversial events such as the Al Ahli Hospital bombing , the deadliest attack of this war , which killed over 470 Palestinians . Right leaning accounts in India have attributed the strike to Hamas rather than Israel , despite evidence pointing to Israel responsibility . India Prime Minister Narendra Modi was one of the first leaders to express support for Israel on 7 October , stating , \" Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families . We stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour \" . \" Experts have observed that right leaning Indian accounts are significantly boosting the Israeli narrative to South Asian audiences , a demographic not easily reached by Western media \" In Israel war on Gaza , there has been a surge of disinformation and fake news on social media , amplified by platforms like X formerly Twitter , particularly focused on spreading anti Palestinian and Islamophobic claims . Experts have observed that right leaning Indian accounts are significantly boosting the Israeli narrative to South Asian audiences , a demographic not easily reached by Western media . This phenomenon could have real life implications for India Muslim community , with violent Islamophobic sentiment already widespread . Whereas support for Israel online has been on a mass scale , there have been only pockets of support for Palestinians , \" Azad Essa , journalist and author of Hostile Homelands : The New Alliance Between India and Israel , told The New Arab . \" Many Muslims in India have told me there is a lot of fear that should they come out on the streets en masse , it would be used as another excuse to label them terrorists or make them targeted on the streets . So there is a lot of helplessness . A unique bromance In India , the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party BJP has forged strong connections with Israel , both on the political and social levels . Essa explained that Hindutva , the ideology and movement of Hindu nationalism , shares Israel approach to confronting terrorists referring to the perception of Muslims in both countries . Israel has even supported India in its past conflicts with Pakistan by providing mortars , ammunition , and advanced laser guided missiles . India is the largest buyer of Israeli made arms , splurging over 1 billion annually . In 2017 , Prime Minister Modi made history by becoming the first Indian PM to journey to Israel . During the visit , he stated that both countries share a \" deep , centuries old connection , \" thus ushering in a robust political alliance paired with military and cyber security agreements . \" Hindutva and Zionism both share a similar expansionist nature , \" Essa remarked . \" India considers all of south Asia Hindu , while Israel dreams of a Greater Israel extending beyond its present borders . In addition to spreading online disinformation , supporters of India ruling BJP party have taken to the streets in support of Israel war against Gaza . Getty In both these nations , certain faiths enjoy more privileges than others , with Hindus and Jews wielding more rights than any minority . Islamophobia has been on the rise since the ascent of Modi BJP . A report from the Australia based Islamic Council of Victoria revealed that the majority of Islamophobic tweets on X originate from India . The binding force of these nationalist ideologies lies in Islamophobia and the drive to put Muslims in their place , Essa added , explaining that for India , Israel serves as a model for governance . India aspires to be like Israel , envisioning itself as a first world , advanced liberal democracy , similar to Israel , which , as we know , is not an actual democracy , \" said Essa . Essa explained that Hindu nationalists dream of replicating the Israeli apartheid system against Palestinians , and this is reflected in endless vilification online . \" In some ways , apartheid is well underway in India , \" he noted . \" India is the most populous country in the world with many Internet users , especially English speaking users , so the mobilisation of Indian influencers or disinfluencers promoting disinformation is really significant \" Social media wars In many cases , anti Muslim and Islamophobic sentiments are tools used by populist leaders to gain popularity by exacerbating social conflicts and pitting one group against another , explained Associate Professor of Middle East Studies at Hamad bin Khalifa University and disinformation researcher Marc Owen Jones . \" This could be deliberate to drive popularity for Modi . It could be a political strategy designed to rally his base , \" Jones told The New Arab , explaining that India digital media power and influence on people perceptions of world events should not to be underestimated . \" India is the most populous country in the world with many Internet users , especially English speaking users , so the mobilisation of Indian influencers or disinfluencers promoting disinformation is really significant , \" Jones said . \" If you look at the most popular Tweets posts on X about Israel and Palestine , the majority are from Indian journalists who tend to support Israel and misrepresent Palestine , \" he added . Furthermore , the BJP IT Cell the department that manages social media campaigns plays a key role . According to Swati Chaturvedi \" I Am a Troll \" book , volunteers are hired to follow instructions from the social media cell and its affiliated organisations to share propaganda . The amount of disinformation is staggering this time , \" Essa remarked . Thousands of Indian right wing accounts are bolstering Israeli propaganda and helping Israel reach South Asian audiences . \" Essa points out that these false narratives serve a dual purpose , not only portraying Palestinians as stereotypical terrorists but also as predators against women . Both Zionism and Hindutva share a common fear of being outnumbered by Muslims , which strengthens the case for nationalism . Anyone daring to oppose these ideologies is labelled as anti nationalist , Essa said . It increasingly challenging to discuss Palestine in India . RELATED Does Israel have an endgame in Gaza ? Analysis Paid to spread fake news One individual actively working to debunk misinformation and counter Israeli propaganda while amplifying Palestinian voices is Mohammed Zubair , an Indian journalist and co founder of Alt News , an Indian nonprofit fact checking website . Zubair has faced backlash from official accounts , including the Consul General of Israel to Midwest India , Kbbi Shoshani , who urged him to Stop spreading fake news and hatred about Israel , \" in his post on \" People often fail to fact check information and tend to use any piece of information to justify the attacks on Palestinian civilians , Zubair told The New Arab . Given that India has more WhatsApp users than social media users , Essa argues that most misinformation and disinformation originate from WhatsApp , particularly within large group chats . However , Zubair contends that X remains the primary platform for the spread of misinformation and disinformation : \" Numerous right wing Indian influencers with substantial followings , some even followed by high ranking officials such as Modi himself , play a pivotal role in disseminating Israeli propaganda \" . The spread of Islamophobic information online could have real life consequences for India Muslim community , which already faces severe persecution . Getty These accounts intentionally share emotional content , even if it is false , so that they can attract a large audience , Zubair explained . Additionally , X current regulations permit these accounts particularly subscribers to X Premium with substantial followings and interactions to earn money , providing additional incentive to keep posting . Despite the availability of community notes , which allow audiences to explain facts beneath each post , some people remain unfazed and keep posting to generate revenue , Zubair added . By doing so , disinformation campaigns become lucrative businesses . \" Prior to Elon Musk acquisition of the platform in 2022 , accounts that posted inappropriate or false content would receive warnings before being suspended . Now , these accounts get amplified , especially if they have a blue checkmark , Zubaied explained . Despite efforts from individuals speaking up for the Palestinian side , the pro Israeli stance remains dominant among the public . \" Prior to Elon Musk acquisition of the platform in 2022 , accounts that posted inappropriate or false content would receive warnings before being suspended . Now , these accounts get amplified , especially if they have a blue checkmark \" In a recent incident , a 20 year old Muslim from Karnataka Hospet district was arrested for posting a WhatsApp status that appeared to support Palestine . Although some local reports described the post as provocative , the content featured a picture of war torn Palestine with the words We Stand with Palestine Palestine Zindabad . \" \" This wave of misinformation is undoubtedly going to have implications for Muslims in India , as they will have to address every terrorist attack occurring worldwide , and justify how they are not associated with militant groups like Hamas , \" Zubair noted . Jones notes that the Islamophobic sentiment can spill out to real life consequences for Muslims all over the world , similar to the tragic killing of Wadea Al Fayoume , six year old boy in Chicago , who was stabbed to death by a man who police say targeted him and his mother because they were Muslim and Palestinian Americans . \" Islamophobia stemming from Indian accounts will not only contribute to hate crimes inside India alone . Who says it wo affect the experiences of Muslims abroad , including those living in the US for instance ? \" Jones asked .

Key Points to Ponder : What the ongoing Even as the Law Commission is now close to finalising its report on the conduct of simultaneous polls , the Election Commission EC , in its meeting with members of the law panel earlier this year , is learnt to have underlined the need for a definite lead time of up to a year before implementation , citing steep logistical challenges in manufacturing voting machines . What Election Commission said regarding one nation , one poll ? What the Law Commission , headed by Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi , former Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court said regarding the one nation , one poll ? Advertisement What are the issues and concerns flagged by the Election Commission EC ? Advertisement What is the significance of semiconductors and chips in the context of simultaneous elections ? Advertisement For Your Information Sources told The Indian Express that in its feedback to the law panel earlier this year regarding the feasibility of conducting simultaneous polls , the EC flagged concerns about the global shortage of semiconductors and chips , which is an essential component for manufacturing Electronic Voting Machines EVMs Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail or VVPAT machines . This shortage posed significant challenges in meeting the EC additional voting machine requirements about 4 lakh for just the Lok Sabha polls in 2024 , not taking into account the additional number required for conducting all elections together . They EC felt that a definite lead time of up to a year would be required for ramping up the voting machine production lines , keeping in view the current commitments of the two manufacturers Bharat Electronic and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd . Moreover , the shortage of semiconductors , in the wake of the pandemic and the Russia Ukraine war , has further messed up the timelines for EVM procurement , said a source who did not want to be identified . The EC has never opposed the idea of holding simultaneous elections , as long as the logistical arrangements for EVM procurement are addressed , there is consensus among political parties , and there are corresponding amendments to the Constitution . The poll panel , however , wants six months to a year to prepare for it . This is the first time the EC has raised concerns about production challenges related to the semiconductor shortage . Earlier this year , in its submission to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel , Public Grievances , Law , and Justice , the poll panel attributed its inability to spend over 80 per cent of the budget allocated for procuring EVMs in 2022 2023 , till January 31 , to the global shortage of semiconductors , which resulted in delays in the machine manufacturing process . The EC is firmly against roping in private manufacturers to increase production capacity , fearing potential damage to the credibility of the electoral process and public faith . The EC has provided estimates to the Law Commission on the additional number of EVMs and VVPAT machines it would require if assembly and Lok Sabha polls are held simultaneously in 2024 and 2029 . A voting machine essentially consists of three parts : a control unit , a ballot unit , and a VVPAT . For 2024 , an additional lakh control units which initiate the voting process , lakh ballot units on which voters casts their vote , and lakh VVPATs which produce a printout post voting to verify the voter choice will be needed , with an additional cost of approximately Rs crore . If elections were to be held simultaneously in 2029 , the EC would require a total of lakh ballot units , lakh control units , and lakh VVPATs . The anticipated shortfall is lakh ballot units , lakh control units and lakh VVPATs , for which the government would need to allocate close to Rs crore . The increased demand for voting machines and VVPATs in 2029 is due to the growing number of voters and polling stations . The latter is expected to increase from lakh in 2024 to lakh in 2029 . Know about Electronic Voting Machines EVMs and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail VVPAT What are Electronic Voting Machines EVMs ? What are Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail VVPAT ? Do You EVM or Electronic Voting Machines are used to cast vote without revealing your identity . It is used in Indian General and State Elections . It has replaced paper ballots in local , state and general parliamentary elections in India . EVM has two parts , it consists of a control unit and a balloting unit , connected by a 5 metre cable . The control unit is with the Election Commission appointed polling officer ; the balloting unit is in the voting compartment into which the voter enters to cast the vote in secret by pressing the button against the name and symbol of the candidate of her choice . The control unit is the EVM brain the balloting unit is turned on only after the polling officer presses the Ballot button on it . The EVM runs on a 6 volt single alkaline battery fitted in the control unit , and can even be used in areas that have no electricity . The use of EVM started back in 1982 Kerala Assembly elections . Prior to this only ballot papers and ballot boxes were allowed . There are only two Indian PSUs that manufacture EVM machines . Bharat Electronic Limited BEL being the first and Electronics Corporation of Indian Limited ECIL the other . The secret source code is only accessible to a few engineers . Engineers who are in the factory have no clue about the constituency wise deployment of the machine . Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail VVPAT machines are used during election process to verify that the vote polled by a voter goes to the correct candidate . VVPATs are a second line of verification and are particularly useful in the time when allegations around Electronic Voting Machines tampering crop up . Parties have been making regular demands for VVPATs to be used during elections after alleging EVMs may not be completely secure and tamper proof . VVPAT system gives instant feedback to the voter showing that the vote polled has in fact been allotted against the candidate chosen . After a voter presses the button on the EVM against the chosen candidate , the VVPAT prints a slip containing name of the candidate and the election symbol and drops it automatically into a sealed box . The machines give the chance for the voter to verify their vote . The machine is placed in a glass case in a way that only the voter can see it . The slip is displayed to the voter for seven seconds after which the VVPAT machine cuts it and drops in into the storage box with a beep . The machines can be accessed , though , by the polling officials and not by the voter . Other Important Articles Covering the same topic : The 360 UPSC Debate Does India Need Simultaneous Elections ?

This sums up the much awaited verdict in the marriage equality matter Supriya Chakraborty v Union of India . Forget the recognition of marriages for sexual minorities or civil unions of queer people , it appears that even others seem to have lost the fundamental right to marry in heterosexual marriages . Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court unanimously rejected to grant legal recognition to same sex marriage What exactly Supreme Court Said in Supriya Chakraborty v Union of India ? Despite dissenting opinions articulated by the Chief Justice of India and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul , who accorded recognition to the right to establish unions and jointly undertake adoption , the bench was surprisingly unequivocal in asserting that there is no fundamental right to marriage under the Indian After months of anticipation , the pronouncement is a profound letdown for the community and constitutional law ? The decision appears to have succumbed to the prevailing ethos of majoritarian morality rather than oft repeated constitutional you agree with the same ? majoritarian morality vs constitutional morality compare Could you provide further instances in which judicial rulings have yielded to the dominant ethos of majority morality rather than adhering to constitutional morality ? Do you agree with the authors that the judgment become a classic case of judicial restraint ? What institutional limitations Supreme Court cited in its verdict ? Supreme Court Verdict The bench was unanimous that marriage is a statutory right and not a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution and , hence , a subject matter for the Parliament and state legislatures . This Court can not either strike down the Constitutional validity of SMA or read words into the SMA because of its institutional limitations . This Court can not read words into the provisions of the SMA and provisions of other allied laws such as the ISA Indian Succession Act and the HSA Hindu Succession Act because that would amount to judicial legislation . The Court , in the exercise of the power of judicial review , must steer clear of matters , particularly those impinging on policy , which fall in the legislative domain , the CJI said , a view that other judges agreed with . In the four separate judgments by the CJI , Justice Kaul , Justice Bhat and Justice Narasimha there was agreement in the bench that queerness is a natural phenomenon and is not urban or elite , that there exists no fundamental right to marry under the Constitution that the Special Marriage Act , 1954 SMA , is neither unconstitutional nor can it be interpreted in such a manner so as to enable marriage between queer persons ; and that transgender persons in heterosexual relationships , have the right to solemnize marriage under existing legal frameworks . According to CJI , in pursuance of the power conferred by Articles 245 and 246 read with Entry 5 of the Concurrent List , Parliament has enacted laws creating and regulating the socio legal institution of marriage . The State legislatures have made amendments to such laws with the assent of the President since the subject of marriage is in the Concurrent List . The petitioners seek that the Court recognise the right to marry as a fundamental right . As explained above , this would mean that even if Parliament and the State legislatures have not created an institution of marriage in exercise of their powers under Entry 5 of the Concurrent List , they would be obligated to create an institution because of the positive postulate encompassed in the right to marry . This argument can not be accepted . Though it concluded that there is no fundamental right to marry , the CJI ruling said there is a right or freedom to enter into a union as laid down in various judgments of the court Navtej Johar , K S Puttaswamy , NALSA , Shakti Vahini , Shafin Jahan etc and that having regard to our constitutional values , which entail respect to the choice of a person whether or when to enter into marriage and the right to choose a marital partner . The three judges , who formed the majority view , called this the right to relationship . The five bench Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice of India CJI D Y Chandrachud , which declined to recognise same sex marriages , also considered the issue of adoption by non heterosexual couples . The current adoption rules of the country under the Central Adoption Resource Authority CARA allow unmarried persons to adopt children only in an individual capacity . Unmarried couples , including queer couples , can not jointly adopt a child . The eligibility criteria for prospective adoptive parents under Regulation 5 3 require a couple to have been in at least two years of stable marital relationship . CJI Chandrachud said that this Regulation was discriminating against the queer community and hence was violating the Article 15 of the Constitution . The majority view by Justices S Ravindra Bhat , Hima Kohli and P S Narasimha acknowledged that the needs of such couples to have and raise family in every sense of the term has to be accommodated within the framework of the law , but held that the regulation can not be held void . This exclusion has the effect of reinforcing the disadvantage already faced by the queer community . Law can not make an assumption on good and bad parenting based on the sexuality of individuals . Such an assumption perpetuates a stereotype based on sexuality that only heterosexuals are good parents , the CJI read out . The CJI said that the regulation shall be read down to exclude the word marital so that it includes both married and unmarried couples as well as queer couples so that they too can jointly adopt a child . Though the additional criteria adopted by the state notifications would also affect a heterosexual person eligibility to adopt a child , it would disproportionately affect a non heterosexual couple , as their unions are not recognised by the law in the form of marriage . An unmarried heterosexual couple has the option of marrying to meet the eligibility but this option is not available to a non heterosexual couple , the CJI said . He said that while the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection Act granted CARA the power to subscribe additional criteria , it can not exceed the scope of legislative policy . He said that the JJ Act does not preclude unmarried couples from adopting a child stating that the best interest of the child has to be the main objective . While Justice S K Kaul agreed with the CJI , Justices S Ravindra Bhat , Hima Kohli and P S Narasimha had a different view . This is not to say that unmarried couples whether queer or heterosexual are not capable or suitable to be adoptive parents . However , once the law permits , as it has done adoption by both single individuals , the likelihood of their joining and cohabiting can not be ruled out . In such an event , de facto family unit can and does come about , Justice Bhat said . He added that the Regulation 5 3 of CARA can not be held void , at the same time the CARA and Central government should appropriately consider such family units where single individuals have committed to adopt and thereafter start living in a non matrimonial relationship . In an unforeseen eventuality , the adopted child in question could face exclusion from the benefits otherwise adopted by the children of married couples . This aspect needs consideration for which the court is not the appropriate forum , Justice Bhat said . The three judges also said that the underlying assumption in law that unmarried heterosexual or queer couples should not adopt needs to be closely examined . It said that the state needs to explore every possibility and not rule out any policy or legislative choice to ensure maximum welfare and benefits reach the largest number of children .

Key Points to Ponder : What the ongoing story With 5 billion forex swap between the Reserve Bank of India RBI and banks set to mature today , a majority of lenders have arranged for dollars to be delivered to the RBI . In April last year , the RBI conducted a dollar rupee USD INR sell buy swap auction for an amount of 5 billion . Under the swap , the central bank sold dollars to banks with an agreement to buy back those dollars at maturity , which is October 23 . What is a swap in forex ? What exactly is meant by the term Dollar Rupee Swap Auction ? The absorption of 5 billion forex swap by the RBI will release Rs crore of rupee liquidity into the banking this is significant ? What is the liquidity of the banking system ? What is the liquidity deficit of banks in India ? How liquidity is managed by RBI ? Do You Know Higher demand for dollars created some temporary dollar liquidity shortage in the banking system . In order to meet their dollar demand , banks , in the last few days , bought dollars under USD INR buy sell swap either from the interbank market or from exporters or other forex market participants to deliver dollars to the RBI . These swaps are of shorter tenure with maturity of one to two days . Forex dealers said it is the RBI which is supplying dollars to the market through select banks . Though banks are expecting the forex swap to mature today , they are not certain how the RBI is going to take the delivery of dollars . Some market participants feel that the central bank may stagger the absorption of dollars over a few days so that banks do not have to supply the entire 5 billion in one go . Spreading of the dollar delivery will not exert pressure on the rupee . This will also mean that the entire Rs crore rupee liquidity will not come back to the system in one day . The RBI has been maintaining that it does not want excessive liquidity in the system as it can pose risks to both price and financial stability . Bankers said that even if the Rs of rupee liquidity comes back to the system today , the RBI can use instruments such as variable reverse repo rate auction or OMO sales open market operations sales to manage liquidity . According to Investopedia , a foreign currency swap is an agreement between two foreign parties to swap interest payments on a loan made in one currency for interest payments on a loan made in another currency . A foreign currency swap can involve exchanging principal , as well . This would be exchanged back when the agreement ends . Usually , though , a swap involves notional principal that just used to calculate interest and is actually exchanged . One purpose of engaging in a currency swap is to procure loans in foreign currency at more favorable interest rates than might be available borrowing directly in a foreign market .

Mains Examination : General Studies II : Effect of policies and politics of developed and developing countries on India interests . Key Points to Ponder : What the ongoing 2024 is going to be a massively significant year for the global economy because it will witness elections in some of the biggest and most influential economies . These include India , Russia , the UK , the EU and the US . Together , the GDP of these countries is more than 54 trillion that around 52 of the global GDP in 2023 . Thanks to a deeply interconnected , between them , these countries and their leaders would not only decide the course of their respective economies but also influence the shape of policymaking in other countries . From the global standpoint , however , the most important election within these could be the one in the US where , as things stand , President Joe Biden is likely to run for re election . However , with just about 12 months left , Biden is facing a stiff challenge from Donald Trump the man he defeated in 2020 . Most opinion polls suggest that President Biden approval ratings are at their lowest point . What is Bidenomics ? For Your Information According to the White House , Biden economic vision is centred around three key pillars : 1 . Making smart public investments in America 2 . Empowering and educating workers to grow the middle class 3 . Promoting competition to lower costs and help entrepreneurs and small businesses thrive In other words , Bidenomics involves policies that improve US physical and digital infrastructure , reduce its trade dependence on rivals such as China , raise the living standards and opportunities available for the middle 40 and the bottom 50 of the US population and , in doing all these things , boost job creation within its borders . To achieve these goals , the Biden administration has tweaked both the tax regime as well as its spending choices . On the one hand , it aimed to raise 737 billion via more and higher taxation , while on the other , it decided to make fresh spending worth 500 billion towards investments in clean energy and in reducing healthcare costs . It has also taken several steps to contain the concentration of economic powers in the hands of the few and tried to empower labour unions to safeguard labour rights . Why Bidenomics matters ? When it comes to Bidenomics , there are two main concerns What are they ? What is the rationale behind Bidenomics ? For Your In common parlance , Bidenomics is a term that is used to refer to any and every policy choice made by the Biden administration . But the term was not coined by Biden or his team even though they have adopted it over the years . That is not to say that Bidenomics does have a cogent idea behind it . It does , even though it is a reaction to the dominant way in which the US economy was structured , especially since 1981 when Republican President Ronald Reagan took office . Under Reaganomics , the idea was to provide tax cuts to the businesses in a bid to incentivise economic activity even as the role of the government in the economy was reduced . The hope was that the resultant benefits of lower taxes and faster economic growth will trickle down to the broader economy . To some extent this happened . But broadly speaking , over the decades since , this top down approach made the rich richer without necessarily bringing about as much widespread prosperity as its proponents had promised . The sharp rise in inequality be it of income or wealth in the ensuing decades is a damning indictment of this approach . There were many who were not surprised by its failure . Noted economist , and a former US Ambassador to India , John Kenneth Galbraith had said the following for the trickle down theory : it is the less than elegant metaphor that if one feeds the horse enough oats , some will pass through to the road for the sparrows . A June statement by the Biden White House explained why Bidenomics was unveiled : Even as they faced an immediate economic and public health crisis with a raging pandemic , elevated unemployment , snarled supply chains , and hundreds of thousands of small businesses at risk of shuttering the President and Vice President understood that it would be enough to simply go back to the economy we had before the pandemic . That economy was saddled with longstanding challenges that held America back including rising inequality and disinvestment from communities across the country . President Biden recognized that some of those challenges were rooted in a failed trickle down theory that supported slashing taxes for the wealthy and big corporations , shrinking public investment in critical priorities like infrastructure and education , and failing to safeguard market competition . Biden bluntly stated : trickle down economics has never worked . It time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out . Did it work ? Why are so many people unhappy with Bidenomics ?

A popular video on social media shows local Israelis expressing their gratitude to a Bedouin commander named Ashraf for putting up an effective defence against Hamas fighters . The Bedouins are a nomadic Muslim Arab people who live mainly in the Negev desert of southern Israel . They have traditionally been pastoralists with no powerful or exclusive national affiliation , who would , until about a century and a half ago , wander the area between Saudi Arabia and the Sinai with their livestock . How did the Bedouins come to join the Israel Defence Forces IDF ? Is it compulsory for the Bedouin to train with the IDF ? To what extent are the Bedouin integrated in Israeli society ? For Your Information Many of the Bedouin serving in desert reconnaissance units hail from the north of Israel . In communities like Shibli in the north , Bedouin have coexisted with Jewish and Arab communities since the . One individual who underwent army conscription and now works with the Israeli civil services , told this reporter in an interview last year that training with the Israeli army helped him appreciate aspects of Jewish culture , even though he did struggle with the Hebrew language initially . The Bedouin population in Israel currently numbers individuals residing in various regions of the state , with a significant presence in the Negev desert in the South . In 2020 , the Israeli foreign ministry appointed Ishmael Khaldi as Israel first Bedouin ambassador . The first Bedouin high tech company in Israel , Sadel Technologies , was co founded by Ibrahim Sana , a Bedouin , and his two partners . In November 2022 , the Israeli government launched Operation Negev Shield , one of the goals of which is to help Bedouin communities integrate into society through educational programmes aimed at steering young men away from criminal activity . Each week , IDF officers visit schools in various Bedouin communities to educate children .

              " 'Occupation , annexation and other terms you should know related to the Israel Hamas war During a war , political actors , human rights groups , and the media can use unfamiliar terminology without adequately explaining it or even using it correctly . That especially true of the Israel Hamas war and the broader historical context behind it . To that end , Vox is writing a glossary to define and contextualize some of these terms , when possible relying on the accepted laws of conflict and international humanitarian law , or IHL . We include terms that apply specifically to the history of Israel and Palestine , as well as some that apply to conflict generally . Broadly speaking , laws around conduct during armed conflict are found in the Geneva Conventions , the post World War II agreements that form the basis of IHL . Customary IHL principles either reflected in international manuals on the laws of war or in precedents from previous legal cases fills in some of the gaps left by the Geneva Conventions or other treaties . IHL in the context of the Israel Palestine conflict is often difficult to understand mostly because the situation exceeds the concepts and language set out in the law , Laurel Fletcher , co director of the International Human Rights Law Clinic at the University of California Berkeley , told Vox . That true for many reasons ; one of which is that the conflict is between a nation state Israel and Hamas , which is technically a non state actor though it governs Gaza . What harder in this conflict is that Hamas does not follow the laws of war , Fletcher said , reportedly using human shields and concealing their operations in civilian infrastructure in Gaza blurring the lines between a legitimate military target and areas that must be protected under IHL as well as deliberately killing and kidnapping Israeli civilians . Another complicating factor is the status of Gaza itself whether it occupied under the terms of international law or whether that occupation is not official but de facto . That informs Israel legal interpretation of what obligations it is under to Palestinians in Gaza under IHL , Fletcher explained . International laws did not contemplate this situation , Fletcher told Vox , and in some senses , the Israeli Palestinian conflict explodes some of the concepts of IHL ; there is not always a clear cut aggressor in a given round of violence , and the way IHL understands occupation as a temporary status in which the occupied territory retains its own laws , for example does apply to the Israeli Palestinian context . But IHL still governs armed conflict and all parties are obligated to adhere to it , even if they often do . With that in mind , we point out when the situation on the ground complicates IHL concepts , in recognition of the fact that this is a messy , emotional , evolving conflict and add to this glossary as the war unfolds . Occupation Under international law , a territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army such that the army has effective control . There are three elements to consider when determining whether the term fits : whether the foreign army is present without the consent of the local government when it invaded , whether the local government can exercise its powers , and whether the occupying forces exert their own powers over the territory instead . By that definition , many experts in international law say that Israel has occupied the Gaza Strip , as well as the West Bank , East Jerusalem , and the Syrian Golan Heights , since 1967 . Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 , and under the 1947 UN partition plan for the region , the other territories were reserved for a future Palestinian state , while all of Jerusalem was to be governed by an international body . The nature of Israel occupation has varied across these territories and across time , but in all these areas , Israel controls basic utilities , such as water and electricity . The West Bank , for instance , is under military occupation and has been settled by Israelis , who have become increasingly violent toward Palestinians in the last year . The Golan Heights are also under Israeli military occupation , and there are more than 30 Israeli settlements in the Golan , home to about people . For decades , Syria has refused to sign any peace treaty with Israel unless it cedes control of the Golan Heights . Though Israel has claimed to have annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights , it has not done so by the standards of international law , which requires that both the occupying and occupied powers consent to annexation . Then , there Gaza : Though Israel withdrew its settlements from Gaza in 2005 , it has still exercised effective control of Gaza . While there is not international consensus that this amounts to an occupation , many experts consider it sufficient to meet the international law definition . Even before this war broke out , Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza that restricted access to basic goods and restricted the movement of people in and out of the territory . It controlled all heavily militarized access points to Gaza with the exception of the Rafah crossing with Egypt , which coordinates with Israel to manage it . Occupying powers are charged with certain obligations to the civilian population . That includes taking measures to ensure public order , safety , and sufficient hygiene and health standards , and to provide food and medical care . Occupying powers are also prohibited from forcibly transferring the population from or within the occupied territory and exerting collective punishment on the local population . Finally , occupying powers must allow access to international humanitarian aid . Israel has deliberately ignored those obligations , especially amid the war in Gaza . According to international legal authorities , Israel remains an occupying power , which means that it has all of the obligations toward civilians that an occupying power would have , which of course does not fulfill , said Joel Beinin , a professor of Middle East history at Stanford University . Open air prison Open air prison is terminology under international humanitarian law IHL like some of the other words and phrases on this list ; rather , it used specifically in this context to describe the living conditions in Gaza particularly , the control and surveillance Palestinians in Gaza live under , but also the general difficulty of accessing basic necessities . Different groups , from pro Palestinian activists to reporters to human rights groups , have applied the concept to Gaza at least since the late , Ilana Feldman , a professor of anthropology , history , and international affairs at George Washington University , wrote in 2015 . At the term point of origin , Gaza was still under military occupation by Israeli forces an occupation that lasted 38 years and ended with the complete withdrawal of those troops in 2005 . In that context , the term refers to the lack of independence , the inability to come and go freely ; the heavy surveillance of the security state ; and the fact that these conditions are being imposed upon Gaza by an outside actor , Israel . Today , many of these factors remain , albeit under a slightly different framework . Since Hamas took power in 2007 , Israel with the help of Egypt has imposed a blockade on the territory that some human rights groups say amounts to an ongoing occupation that carries legal responsibilities . Gaza does not control its land , sea , or air borders . In all but rare cases , Gaza residents can not leave the 141 square mile territory through the border crossing with Israel for travel , study , or work opportunities there are some limited exceptions , like for work permits within Israel . These policies , which Israel justifies on security grounds , do just preclude international travel through Israel but also effectively sever Palestinians in Gaza from the West Bank a territory of Palestinians separated from Gaza by Israeli territory . Egypt , meanwhile , restricts movement through Rafah , its one border crossing , and has at times closed it completely due to concerns that extremists and weapons might make their way to Sinai , where they could launch attacks against Israel and draw Egypt into conflict with Israel . Palestinians in occupied territories are subject to an intense surveillance state . Israel uses facial recognition technology to monitor Palestinians in cities like Hebron , as well as significant CCTV surveillance in public spaces in the Palestinian territories . Poor living conditions caused largely by the blockade on goods have also eroded the quality of life in Gaza , as have repeated , escalating cycles of violence between Hamas and Israel . Poverty rates are 53 percent in Gaza , compared to 14 percent in the other occupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank , according to the International Monetary Fund . Now , under the combined effects of the 16 year blockade and the current conflict , conditions in Gaza are more horrific than ever . The present conditions essentially make Gaza less of an open air prison and push it more , as Helen Ottens Patterson , Doctors Without Borders former Gaza head of mission , told Vox , toward the abyss . Collective punishment Collective punishment refers to a government or occupying force harming a person or group of people based on the actions of another member of their group in the context of an armed conflict . It is a war crime , and it is prohibited under the third and fourth Geneva Conventions , which were ratified after World War II , as well as additional protocols established in 1977 . In its strictest definition , collective punishment applies to sanctions and harassment of any sort , administrative , by police action or otherwise , according to customary international law . This is meant to apply specifically to legal and criminal punishments in the context of armed conflict things like confiscating passports or other documentation , arresting individuals , or imposing other legal penalties on a person not for something they themselves did , but because of the actions of another member of their group or perceived group . The Syrian civil war provided some examples of this narrow sense ; in 2019 , for example , the regime of Bashar al Assad seized assets of the families of people the regime had deemed terrorists . Colloquially , the term is often applied to a variety of other actions . The term is used more broadly to include strikes on civilians in response to something that someone else did their state or some members of their community as a form of retaliation or revenge , Adil Haque , a professor at Rutgers University who studies the international law of armed conflict and the philosophy of international law , told Vox in an interview . A UN panel of independent experts said in an October 12 statement that Israel airstrikes on Gaza in response to Hamas murder and kidnapping of Israeli civilians on October 7 is collective punishment . But the siege in Gaza is actually violating the laws of occupation rather than collective punishment in the strictest sense , Haque explained , if one considers Gaza to be occupied territory . And if one accepts that Gaza is occupied , the siege can credibly be called a war crime . Though there is debate about whether Gaza is technically occupied there are no troops on the ground , but Israel controls Gaza air , sea , and land borders and many other aspects of life in the territory occupying powers are obligated under IHL to provide the necessities of life for people in the occupied territory including food , water , medical care , fuel and electricity , and education . Indiscriminate attacks and bombings are also considered to be collective punishment in the colloquial sense of the term , but from an international law perspective , they relate more to the concepts of proportionality and the obligations of all parties to a conflict to protect civilians . For more on those concepts , the International Committee of the Red Cross is a helpful resource . Forced displacement Forced displacement , sometimes also referred to as forced migration , is permissible under IHL only if it occurring to protect civilians in the course of a necessary military operation as part of an international or national conflict . Because it can be considered legal in certain circumstances , then , it difficult to prosecute as an individual crime . That prosecution becomes even more complicated when the forced displacement is carried out by a party that could be considered an occupying power . Therefore , it often prosecuted as part of other crimes , like ethnic cleansing and genocide , but only if the displacement is motivated by the ethnicity of the group in question . Under IHL , whoever orders the displacement must ensure that the civilians will eventually be able to return to their homes , that they will be evacuated to a relatively safe location , and that they will be provided with necessities like food , water , shelter , and medical care when they arrive . The evacuation of British cities during World War II could be considered an instance of legal forced displacement : At the behest of the British government , million people left their homes for their safety during the course of an international conflict . They were provided basic necessities when they got to their destinations , and it was understood that they would be able to return to their homes when it was safe to do so . On October 13 , the Israel Defense Forces told the approximately million Gaza residents in the north of the territory to leave their homes and head south to avoid being hurt or killed in a military operation . They are not to return to the area until given an order from the authorities . But Israel did follow IHL in ordering this displacement ; the state provided none of the basic necessities it is required to under IHL and in fact has prevented civilians from obtaining those necessities under the ongoing siege . Only after days of negotiations and intense international pressure did authorities in Israel and Egypt allow 20 trucks of humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing at Gaza southern border . Israel will defend its operations in northern Gaza as necessary in the course of the war ; it unclear that international bodies like the International Criminal Court or the United Nations would agree . Another critical aspect of forced displacement under IHL is that it temporary : The civilians who have been moved for their safety must be allowed to return to their homes after the operation or other incident is over . But it not clear that this will happen in the context of the Israel Hamas war . This concern , deepened by Palestinians continued displacement since 1948 , is part of the reason Egypt has been unwilling to take in Palestinian refugees from Gaza . What is happening now in Gaza is an attempt to force civilian residents to take refuge and migrate to Egypt , which should not be accepted , Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi said in a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last week . Annexation Annexation is a unilateral act of a State proclaiming its sovereignty over the territory of another State by force or threat of force , per IHL . It is forbidden by international law . Prohibitions against annexation have been part of international law since World War I , though the concept took on more significance in light of Germany actions in World War II . Unlike occupation , annexation is never considered legal under international law . From an international law perspective , annexation does not happen , Haque said . That means that while a country might claim territories in conflict or by use of force , and might formally draw their maps to include those territories and impose their laws on the people within them , international law does not recognize those claims . One clear example of annexation is Russia claim that parts of Ukraine Crimea and the Donbas are actually Russian . This annexation began as a military operation in 2014 , when Russia sent little green men into Crimea , and culminated in its ongoing invasion of Ukrainian territory . Moscow made formal announcements when it annexed Crimea and the Donbas ; Russian laws now govern those territories , even though international law does not recognize those claims . Regarding the current conflict , there are several contexts in which annexation is discussed . First : Israel understands the Golan Heights to be part of its territory and formally annexed it in 1981 ; however , international law considers it to be Syrian territory occupied by Israel since the 1967 war . The extent to which Israel views this territory as its own can be seen in the way some politicians speak about it : I actually consider the last 50 years as the slow process of Israel defining its borders , Einat Wilf , a former Labour member of the Knesset , said on the podcast The Hated and the Dead a few days before Hamas October 7 attack . With the peace agreement with Egypt and the peace agreement with Jordan and the getting out of Lebanon and the annexation of the Golan Heights , Israel enters a process of determining its final borders . Then there the matter of East Jerusalem and the West Bank territories that do not belong to Israel , according to a 1947 United Nations partition plan for the region . Over time , Israel has encroached on East Jerusalem , building settlements and evicting Palestinian families from their homes . Tensions over access to the al Aqsa mosque , or Temple Mount a holy site to both Muslims and Jews have flared in recent years . And finally , there the West Bank , an area that was reserved under the UN plan for a future Palestinian state . Israeli settlements in the West Bank , which has a majority Palestinian population but is occupied by Israel , are , for some settlers , part of a project to ultimately annex the region . Over time , messianic Religious Zionist ideology developed as a significant driver of the settlement movement , based on the notion of a religious imperative for Jews to settle the entire Land of Israel , according to a brief by the Israel Policy Forum , an American Jewish organization working for a two state solution . Settlements established as part of this religious movement were often placed in regions with a large Palestinian population in order to secure Jewish dominance over the territory , prevent a Palestinian state , and secure the entire West Bank for Israel . The US later recognized the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights under Trump and reaffirmed it under Biden . The US under Trump also moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2017 a move made in recognition of the fact that Israel had made unified Jerusalem its capital , but a decidedly controversial one in the international arena , given the international legal issues . Trump administration also argued in 2019 that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are not necessarily illegal , lending legitimacy to Israel claims on the territories . But the annexations and moves toward it are widely regarded as illegal under international law , and no other country has recognized them . Normalization Normalization refers to efforts to establish diplomatic relations between Israel and neighboring Arab countries with the aim of achieving stability , if not peace , in the Middle East . Beginning in 1945 , Egypt , Iraq , Lebanon , Saudi Arabia , Syria , Yemen , and what is now known as Jordan formed an Arab League that opposed the state of Israel because of the Palestinian Arab population that was displaced as a result of its inception in 1948 . It sought to advance the Palestinian cause , often by use of force . Some member countries repeatedly and violently clashed with Israel including in the 1948 Arab Israeli War , the 1967 Six Day War , and the 1973 Yom Kippur War and helped create the Palestine Liberation Organization , a coalition of Palestinian nationalists , initially as a form of militant opposition to Israel . It been decades since those Arab League countries directly fought Israel , and two of them have signed peace treaties with Israel Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994 . That even though the plight of Palestinians remains unresolved , with US led talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority , which controls the West Bank , frozen since 2014 . The US has consequently sought to establish diplomatic , economic , and security channels between Israel and its Arab neighbors with the objective of achieving a level of regional stability that would allow it to turn its attention to other parts of the world , including Russia and China . The Trump administration facilitated the Abraham Accords to normalize relations between Israel and several of its Muslim majority neighbors the United Arab Emirates UAE , Bahrain , Morocco , and Sudan members of the now expanded Arab League , but not ones that have ever been at war with Israel . The Biden administration also sought to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia , in part so that they could form a united front against Iran , a common adversary that financially supports Hamas . Public support in Arab countries for normalization has been low . But for the leaders of the UAE , Bahrain , and Morocco , signing a normalization agreement with Israel made sense since relations between those countries already were in some respects quite close , if not public before those Abraham accords were signed , said Beinin , the professor of Middle East history at Stanford University . It also has facilitated arms sales between the signatory countries . Since the outbreak of war in Gaza , the Saudis have been talking to Iran , seemingly dooming the prospect of a normalization deal for now . Zionism Zionism is a movement that supports the establishment of a permanent homeland for Jewish people in the region now known as Israel and Palestine . Its roots as a political movement date back to the late century following the outbreak of pogroms targeting Jews in what was then Russia , present day Ukraine , and Poland , where Jews were unfairly blamed for the assassination of Czar Alexander II . The violence and the broader rise in antisemitism in Europe in that period drove many Jews toward political activism , including nationalist movements such as Zionism . Not all Jews were Zionists and not all Jews are Zionists now , either . In fact , it was initially a minority movement led by Austrians and Germans . Austrian journalist Theodor Herzl is regarded as the father of modern Zionism , formalizing the ideology in his 1896 German language pamphlet The Jewish State . In it , he argued that the only way Jews could be freed from persecution and discrimination amid rising antisemitism in Europe was to establish , with the support of the international community , their own secular nation . He argued that Palestine was the ideal location because of its historical and religious significance to Jews , the Land of Israel promised to them by God in the Bible and from which they were forced into centuries of exile . Herzl unsuccessfully sought support for the program from the Ottoman Empire , which then controlled Palestine . But he found an ally in Britain , which offered Zionists square miles of uninhabited land in Uganda or locations in other countries . But the Zionists wanted Palestine , and tens of thousands of Jews from Europe began to emigrate there anyway . The British would later come around , however , in their 1917 Balfour Declaration , which unilaterally called for the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine , despite the fact that Jewish people made up less than 15 percent of the population there at the time . Though the declaration vowed that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non Jewish communities in Palestine , it did not outline what those communities were , what specific rights they had , or how they would be protected , and it did take into account their thoughts about how their land should be used . After World War I , the Allied powers backed the declaration , and the newly created League of Nations gave Britain a mandate to temporarily rule Palestine until the Jewish state could be created . Jewish immigration to the area increased , particularly in the early to and after the horrors of the Holocaust , and the influx sparked violent clashes at various times . After World War II , the United Nations agreed to partition Palestine into two states , one for the area Jewish population and another for the Arab population , with the city of Jerusalem to be governed by a special international entity . However , local Arabs and Arab countries objected to the plan . Following a period of extreme violence before , during , and after the war particularly on the part of Zionist militias British forces withdrew from Palestine , and Israel declared its independence on May 14 , 1948 . It won the war with neighboring Arab states that followed , capturing 77 percent of the previous Palestinian mandate territory , including land that the UN had intended to allocate to the Palestinian Arab population . Israel later ended up giving some of that land back to neighboring Arab countries as part of agreements brokered to end various bouts of armed conflict that broke out over the decades . But in 1980 , it also annexed East Jerusalem home to holy sites of significance to Jews , Muslims , and Christians in a move violating international law , as well as occupied and encroached on Palestinian territory in the West Bank and in Gaza . In 2005 , the Israeli government under right wing Prime Minister Ariel Sharon withdrew entirely from Gaza and dismantled four Israeli settlements in the West Bank in a bid to improve Israeli security . Today , with the Jewish state of Israel firmly established , Zionism remains a diverse movement that encompasses people with a broad range of beliefs , including on the policies of the Israeli government . Many Jews feel a kinship to Israel , even if they do not explicitly identify as Zionist . Leftist Zionists believe in Israel right to exist peacefully but may also support a two state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict and Palestinian self determination . Right wing Zionists , on the other hand , have promoted expansionist policies and Israeli settlements in occupied territory . In recent years , it those right wing Zionists who have had control of the Israeli government . They have since built more settlements in the West Bank , undertaking a de facto annexation in parts , and there are fears that Gaza may be next .',\n",
              " 'Nehru Word : How British imperialism created the Palestine problem The Jews are a very remarkable people . Originally , they were a small tribe or several tribes in Palestine , and their early story is told in the Old Testament of the Bible . Rather conceited they were , thinking themselves as the Chosen People . But this is a conceit in which nearly all people have indulged . They were repeatedly conquered and suppressed and enslaved , and some of the most beautiful and moving poems in English are the songs and laments of these Jews as given in the authorised translation of the Bible . I suppose in the original Hebrew they are equally , or even more , beautiful . I shall give you just a few lines from one of the Psalms : By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept ; when we remembered thee , O Sion . As for our harps we hanged them up : upon the trees that are therein . For they that led us away captive required of us then a song , and melody , in our heaviness : Sing us one of the songs of Sion . How shall we sing the Lord song : in a strange land ? If I forgot thee , O Jerusalem : let my right hand forget her cunning . If I do not remember thee , let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth : yea , if I prefer not Jerusalem in my mirth . These Jews were finally dispersed all over the world . They had no home or nation , and everywhere they went , they were treated as unwelcome and undesirable strangers . They were made to live in special areas of cities , apart from the others these areas were called ghettos so that they might not pollute others . Sometimes they were made to put on a special dress . They were humiliated , reviled , tortured , and massacred . The very word Jew became a word of abuse , a synonym for a miser and a grasping money lender . And yet these amazing people not only survived all this , but managed to keep their racial and cultural characteristics , and prospered and produced a host of great men . Today , they hold leading positions as scientists , statesmen , literary men , financiers , businessmen , and even the greatest socialists and communists have been Jews . Most of them , of course , are far from prosperous ; they crowd in the cities of eastern Europe and , from time to time , suffer pogroms or massacres . These people without home or country , and especially the poor among them , have never ceased to dream of old Jerusalem , which appears to their imaginations greater and more magnificent than it ever was in fact . Zion they called Jerusalem , a kind of promised land , and Zionism is this call of the past that pulls them to Jerusalem and Palestine .',\n",

The Israel Defence Forces IDF released video of the raid showing a bulldozer leveling a raised bank amid explosions and tank fire in the Hamas run Palestinian territory . The timing of a long expected full scale Israeli ground invasion remained unclear Thursday , but the consequences of Israel relentless airstrikes , which started immediately after Hamas brutal terror attack on Israel , have already been catastrophic for the million people trapped inside Gaza . The United Nations estimates that some million people have been displaced from their homes within the densely populated region . Gaza health care system is on the verge of total collapse , with over half of its health care facilities no longer functioning , according to the World Health Organization . Water is running out , along with stocks of anesthesia and other vital medicines . Some aid has started flowing in this week , but crucially , no fuel supplies have been allowed across the border into Gaza . The stream of injured being rushed to Gaza hospitals after airstrikes continues . Many of the victims are young children , even babies . People mourn as they collect the bodies of Palestinians killed amid ongoing Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip , 26 , 2023 , in Khan Younis , Gaza . Ahmad Hasaballah Getty Gaza Hamas run Ministry of Health said Wednesday that over 750 people were killed in the previous 24 hours the second day in a row that it claimed a toll over 700 . The total toll in Gaza since Israel started its airstrikes stands at over , according to the ministry , including the disputed death toll from an explosion at the al Ahli hospital last week . Israel says Hamas killed more than people in its unprecedented attack on October 7 and with its ongoing rocket attacks . The Israeli military said Thursday that 224 people were still believed to be held hostage by Hamas in Gaza . Hamas military wing said , meanwhile , that Israel had killed 50 of the hostages with its airstrikes on Gaza . Aid agencies and many countries in the region have warned that an Israeli ground incursion will mean even greater loss of civilian life . Muhammed Kandeel , who works at the Nasser Hospital in Gaza , told CBS News he does even have water to wash his hands sometimes , risking infection among the many wounded people he treating . \" They will know they are going to die , because the hospitals have nothing to offer them , \" he said . \" It can not be described by words . It hell . \" He said the situation is so horrific that he has almost given up . \" We feel we are not a part of the human community , \" Kandeel told CBS News . \" If we are sub human , just tell us , so we can take action by ourselves . \" Those who can not be saved are taken to morgues where overwhelmed staff have been running out of the traditional Islamic shrouds used to prepare bodies for burial . And every day brings new airstrikes and fresh trauma . Overnight , Al Jazeera journalist Wael Al Dahdouh said he learned that his wife , daughter and son were killed alongside 12 other members of his family . They had relocated to the south of Gaza , where they hoped to find relative safety as Israel military has repeatedly urged Palestinians to evacuate to the area . \" Strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law , including the taking of feasible precautions to mitigate civilian casualties , \" the IDF said in a statement shared with CBS News on Thursday . \" Regarding this specific case , the IDF targeted Hamas terrorist infrastructure in the area . \" Palestinian militants from Hamas and other groups have fired barrages of rockets into Israel since the war began , most of which have been intercepted by Israel Iron Dome defense system . The IDF says it only strikes militant targets in Gaza and accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields , hiding weapons and command centers in schools , mosques and other civilian infrastructure . Israel has allowed 74 trucks carrying aid into Gaza through the Rafah crossing from Egypt , the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Thursday . Aid workers say it nowhere near what is necessary , and is only a fraction of the aid that was coming in every day before the war . Israel says it wo allow fuel deliveries into Gaza because Hamas will use it to continue its assault , and it has accused the group long designated a terror organization by the , Israel and most European nations of hoarding fuel there .

              " 'Sponge bombs : How Israel plans to tackle Hamas terror metro NEW DELHI : One of the most formidable challenges awaiting Israeli forces if they decide to invade Gaza is the Hamas terror metro , a network of hundreds of kilometres of tunnels that are used by Hamas fighters to carry out attacks and transport material . Hidden up to a 100 feet below the surface , the intricate city of passages is full of dark twists and turns , laden with traps and heavily reinforced with concrete . The entrances are enclosed under the floors of homes , mosques and schools allowing the terrorists to move unseen through Gaza and evade Israeli airstrikes . Top US officials have repeatedly warned Israel that its forces will not able to easily breach the underground labyrinth and is likely to suffer massive casualties . Lot of IEDs and traps The tunnels are also the main location where Hamas is keeping over 200 hostages taken during the October 7 attack , and will likely be the first casualties if Israel decides to send ground forces . US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said Iraq nine month long battle to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State might prove to have been easier than what awaits the Israelis . There are likely to be a lot of IEDs improvised explosive devices , a lot of booby traps , and just a really grinding activity , he said . Despite nearly three weeks of continuous bombarding of the Gaza Strip , Israeli officials admit that the tunnel network has sustained only minimal damage . \" Although we have been attacking for days and days , the Hamas leadership is pretty much intact , as is the ability to command and control , the ability even to try and launch counter attacks , \" Amir Avivi , a former brigadier general whose senior positions in the Israeli military included deputy commander of the Gaza division , tasked with tackling tunnels told Reuters . New weapon Recognising the need for an efficient way to take down Hamas fighters in their own territory , Israel is field testing sponge bombs , which uses a chemical reaction that explodes foam and can potentially be used to seal off tunnel openings . Israeli troops are said to have been practising with sponge bombs on mock tunnels ahead of an expected ground invasion of Gaza The IDF have not officially commented on their use of \" sponge bombs \" , however they are said to be currently testing the devices , said some media reports . IDF soldiers were first seen using the devices in 2021 as they practised inside their mock tunnel system at the army base close to Gaza border . While engaged in tunnel warfare , the \" sponge bomb \" should prevent Israeli troops from being ambushed by Hamas fighters as they move through the dense burrow system . They can set off the \" bomb \" which will spray foam that rapidly expands and hardens sealing off any entrances Hamas could emerge out from . Two liquids are held inside a plastic container separated by a metal divider and once this is removed , the foamy mess explodes .

              " 'What is Gaza Ministry of Health and how does it calculate the war death toll ? JERUSALEM AP How many Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the war between Israel and Hamas started ? With Israel besieging and bombing territory at a scale never seen before , arriving at a precise answer is easy . Cell service is spotty . Internet and power are out . Airstrikes have pulverized roads and leveled neighborhoods , slowing rescue work . Doctors scribble on notepads in overflowing morgues and hospital halls , struggling to account for bodies trapped under rubble and tossed in hastily dug mass graves . The chaos has added to the likelihood of errors . Yet the Gaza based Ministry of Health an agency in the Hamas controlled government continues to tally casualty numbers . It released its first detailed report on the casualties Thursday , giving names , ID numbers , ages and gender for Palestinians it says have been killed . The total toll is Palestinians , including minors , according to the ministry . The ministry is the only official source for Gaza casualties . Israel has sealed Gaza borders , barring foreign journalists and humanitarian workers . The AP is among a small number of international news organizations with teams in Gaza . While those journalists can not do a comprehensive count , they viewed large numbers of bodies at the sites of airstrikes , morgues and funerals . The United Nations and other international institutions and experts , as well as Palestinian authorities in the West Bank rivals of Hamas say the Gaza ministry has long made a good faith effort to account for the dead under the most difficult conditions . The numbers may not be perfectly accurate on a minute to minute basis , said Michael Ryan , of the World Health Organization Health Emergencies Program . But they largely reflect the level of death and injury . In previous wars , the ministry counts have held up to scrutiny , independent investigations and even Israel tallies . But an outlier is the ministry death toll from an explosion at al Ahli Hospital in Gaza City last week . There were conflicting accusations of who was responsible , with Hamas officials blaming an Israeli airstrike and Israel saying it was caused by a an errant rocket launched by Palestinian militants . and French intelligence services also concluded it was likely caused by a misfired rocket . An AP analysis of video , photos and satellite imagery , as well as consultation with experts , showed the cause was likely a rocket launched from Palestinian territory that misfired and crashed . However , a definitive conclusion could be reached . There have also been conflicting accounts of the explosion death toll . Within an hour , Gaza ministry reported 500 Palestinians killed , then lowered that to 471 the next day . Israel says the ministry inflated the toll . American intelligence agencies estimate 100 to 300 people killed , but have said how they arrived at the numbers . The confusion has called into question the ministry credibility in the Hamas ruled territory . Here a look at how Gaza Health Ministry has generated death tolls since the war started . HOW DOES THE MINISTRY ARRIVE AT A DEATH TOLL ? Gaza most widely quoted source on casualties is Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al Qidra . From an office at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City , al Qidra receives a constant flow of data from every hospital in the strip . Hospital administrators say they keep records of every wounded person occupying a bed and every dead body arriving at a morgue . They enter this data into a computerized system shared with al Qidra and colleagues . According to screenshots hospital directors sent to AP , the system looks like a color coded spreadsheet divided into categories : name , ID number , date of hospital entry , type of injury , condition . Names are always available , al Qidra said . He and colleagues face disruptions because of spotty connectivity but say they call to double check the numbers . The ministry collects data from other sources , too , including the Palestinian Red Crescent . Every person entering our hospital is recorded , said Atef Alkahlout , director of Gaza Indonesian Hospital . That a priority . The ministry releases casualty updates every few hours , providing the number of dead and wounded with a breakdown for men , women and minors . The ministry generally does provide names , ages or locations of those killed . That information comes from reporters on the ground or the Hamas run government media office . But Thursday , in response to doubts over its figures , the ministry released a 212 page report listing every Palestinian killed in the war so far , including their names , ID numbers , ages and gender . A copy of the report shared with the AP names Palestinians and says an additional 281 bodies have not yet been identified . The list did not provide a breakdown by location . The ministry never distinguishes between civilians and combatants . That becomes clearer after the dust settles , when the and rights groups investigate and militant groups offer a tally of members killed . The Israeli military also conducts post war investigations . The Health Ministry does report how Palestinians were killed , whether from Israeli airstrikes and artillery barrages or other means , like errant Palestinian rocket fire . It describes all casualties as victims of Israeli aggression . That lack of transparency has drawn criticism . When the Hamas health agency comes out with the numbers , take it with a pinch of salt , Lt . Col . Richard Hecht , Israeli military spokesman , said in a briefing Thursday . But he repeatedly declined to offer any alternative number of Palestinian casualties . Israel says more than civilians and soldiers were killed and over 200 hostages seized when Hamas invaded Israel . The army has identified 309 of those killed as soldiers so far . WHO WORKS IN THE MINISTRY ? Hamas , as Gaza ruling authority , exerts control over the Health Ministry . But it different than political and security agencies that Hamas runs . The Palestinian Authority , which controlled Gaza before Hamas overran the area in 2007 , retains power over health and education services in Gaza , though it based in the occupied West Bank . The ministry is a mix of recent Hamas hires and older civil servants affiliated with the secular nationalist Fatah party , officials say . The Fatah dominated authority that administers Palestinian cities in the Israeli occupied West Bank has its own health ministry in Ramallah , which still provides medical equipment to Gaza , pays Health Ministry salaries and handles patient transfers from the blockaded enclave to Israeli hospitals . Health Minister Mai al Kaila in Ramallah oversees the parallel ministries , which receive the same data from hospitals . Her deputy is based in Gaza . The Ramallah ministry said it trusts casualty figures from partners in Gaza , and it takes longer to publish figures because it tries to confirm numbers with its own Gaza staff . Hamas tightly controls access to information and runs the government media office that offers details on Israeli airstrikes . But employees of the Health Ministry insist Hamas does dictate casualty figures . Hamas is one of the factions . Some of us are aligned with Fatah , some are independent , said Ahmed al Kahlot , director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza . More than anything , we are medical professionals . WHAT IS THE TRACK RECORD FROM PAST WARS ? Throughout four wars and numerous bloody skirmishes between Israel and Hamas , agencies have cited the Health Ministry death tolls in regular reports . The International Committee of the Red Cross and Palestinian Red Crescent also use the numbers . In the aftermath of war , the humanitarian office has published final death tolls based on its own research into medical records . In all cases the counts have largely been consistent with the Gaza Health Ministry , with small discrepancies . 2008 war : The ministry reported Palestinians killed ; the reported . 2014 war : The ministry reported Palestinians killed ; the reported . 2021 war : The ministry reported 260 Palestinians killed ; the reported 256 . While Israel and the Palestinians disagree over the numbers of militants versus civilians killed in past wars , Israel accounts of Palestinian casualties have come close to the Gaza ministry . For instance , Israel Foreign Ministry said the 2014 war killed Palestinians just a bit lower than the ministry toll . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has killed thousands of militants in the current war , without offering evidence or precise numbers . International news agencies , including AP , as well as humanitarian workers and rights groups , have used the ministry numbers when independent verification is impossible . These figures are professionally done and have proven to be reliable , said Omar Shakir , Human Rights Watch Israel and Palestine director , adding he remained cognizant of different blind spots and weaknesses such as the failure to distinguish between civilians and combatants . WHAT ABOUT THE HOSPITAL BLAST ? Less than an hour after images of the explosion surfaced on social media , the ministry reported that 200 to 300 people had been killed at al Ahli Hospital . A half hour later , the ministry put that toll at a staggering 500 . The next day , it revised the number down to 471 , without releasing details . Western intelligence agencies said they believed the toll was considerably lower . President Joe Biden said he had no confidence in the accuracy of the ministry reporting . However , the government annual human rights assessments from the region frequently cite the Gaza ministry . Gaza Health Ministry stands by the 471 figure and includes it in the total death toll . When asked about conflicting accounts , authorities emphasize the difficulties of their work and vigorously deny any fabrication . We had a uniquely hard time because the bodies were so dismembered , body parts were everywhere , Health Ministry official Mehdat Abbas said .',\n",

              " 'Gaza healthcare crisis deepens as casualties rise The wounded keep dying in front of your eyes but there nothing you can do , and I think that is a trauma I will carry with me for all my life , Bassel Amr , a volunteer ICU physician told Middle East Eye . He called the aftermath of ground attacks beyond worst case scenario as the situation on the ground in Gaza unfolds . Gaza hospitals were already at full capacity , tending to patients , including those who were wounded , pregnant women , children , and newborn infants in the aftermath of Israeli airstrikes . Unfortunately , with the recent ground invasion , the situation has further deteriorated . In addition to the existing patients , healthcare personnel are now also confronted with trauma injuries resulting from ground attacks . The smell of blood and sand is everywhere , Dr Mohammad Mattar , head of radiology department at Al Shifa Hospital which is Gaza strip largest and as of now only operational medical complex since other places have run out of fuel told NPR . We are left in a situation where we have to make the difficult decision to risk the life of one patient in order to save the life of another , Dr Amr said . We already warned a few days ago that the hospital wo be able to deal with any other crisis in coming days since the equipment and necessary tools were already running out , now after the ground raids , it has become impossible to hunt for any resources , hence we have to utilise whatever is left , he added . When Israel started to prepare for its planned ground invasion of Gaza , it warned the residents in the north to flee south so that they do become a target , that included hospitals too . But healthcare community in Gaza insisted that the evacuation of the wounded and displaced would be impossible . As of now , around 600 babies are in incubators and out of them , 120 are in critical life or death situation . With no fuel , we left with no choice but to choose between who we can save and who we can not , and I have never endured a more heart situation in my entire career , Dr Amr said . Al Shifa hospital currently accommodates displaced individuals , and the rapid spread of viruses is a growing concern . This exacerbates the issue of inadequate sterilisation within the hospital , leaving patients susceptible to infections . , most hospitals had to make morgues in the functional wards to accommodate the dead bodies which are still there and the count of everyday is in hundreds . All of it can not be evacuated suddenly , an intern at Al Shifa told Reuters . International groups have issued warnings regarding the potential for water borne diseases and scabies due to the shortage of clean water in the area . Amr further noted that the nature of injuries treated at his hospital , primarily involving scarring and disfigurements , foreshadows an impending health crisis following the conclusion of hostilities . Hussam al Madhoun echoed a comparable scenario at the Al Awda hospital in the northern Gaza region which has become partially non functional as of now since it has completely run out of fuel . He emphasised that the hospital is extremely overcrowded , with no space to walk , as thousands of civilians have sought shelter there due to the Israeli airstrikes . Similar to the situation at Al Shifa , Al Awda is grappling with insufficient capacity to handle casualties and is facing a critical shortage of medical supplies , especially after ground invasion . He added that Gaza is now suffering from a shortage of shrouds . is nothing worse than not finding enough shrouds to cover the martyrs , so you wrap them with garbage bags and old pieces of cloth , he said . Now , with the ongoing siege and the fuel running out , a humanitarian catastrophe is imminent , and we will lose patients in our department and possibly thousands of patients in the entire hospital , he added . Previously , in a video released by DW Cut , doctors have pleaded several times that Gaza is about to experience a total collapse of the healthcare system due to supplies running out like sand in hand and the number of casualties increasing each day .

Israel has launched a massive counter offensive against Hamas after unprecedented attacks by the militant group on October 7 killed more than people . Advertisement Biden told reporters at a joint news conference with the visiting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese that his analysis is based on his instinct and does not have any proof for this . I convinced one of the reasons Hamas attacked when they did , and I have no proof of this , just my instinct tells me , is because of the progress we were making towards regional integration for Israel , and regional integration overall . We ca leave that work behind , Biden said . This is the second time in less than a week that Biden has mentioned the India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor as a potential reason for the terrorist attack by Hamas .

              " 'Israel releases graphic video of Hamas terror attacks as part of \" narrative battle \" over war in Gaza In an auditorium at an Israeli military base north of Tel Aviv on Monday , I joined dozens of foreign journalists who were shown 43 minutes of graphic , gruesome video and photographs that the Israel Defense Forces said were made during Hamas 7 attack on Israel . Some of the images had circulated online before , in some cases in truncated and edited form , but most of what we saw was unedited and very disturbing . The IDF said it compiled the images from militants body cameras , victims dash cams and cellphones , security cameras at kibbutzim , and other sources . The IDF decided to share them , international spokesman Lt . Col . Richard Hecht told me , as part of his country \" narrative battle . \" It comes as international criticism mounts over civilian casualties in Israel military campaign in Gaza . \" We understand that there a narrative battle here and that we have to show the world what happened here , \" Hecht said . \" We doing everything we can to show the media that there a reason why we doing what we doing . Hamas started this in the most heinous way . \" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Maj . Mickey Edelstein speaks to an auditorium full of journalists at a military base north of Tel Aviv , 23 , 2023 . CBS News Cameron Stewart We were not allowed to record the images played for us by the IDF we were told , out of respect for grieving families . The Hamas militants who launched the surprise attack on Israel operated on a much different policy , filming and livestreaming parts of their murderous rampage with body or helmet cameras . Not all of the material could be independently verified by the news media . This is some of what we were shown : Hamas militants lobbing a grenade into what appears to be a home bomb shelter , killing a father before he could slam the door shut . His young sons , wearing only their underwear , were splattered with blood but survived . In another clip , the boys are in their kitchen , crying out for their mother , as one attacker pulls a Coca Cola from their refrigerator and takes a leisurely sip . The younger brother says he ca see out of one eye and asks , \" Why am I alive ? \" Some journalists in the hall gasped and held their heads in their hands . In another clip , a militant stands over a man who appears to have been shot in the gut and hacks at him multiple times with a garden hoe . As Hamas fighters raged through another kibbutz , we watched them set fire to a home ; shoot a black Labrador trotting toward them ; and execute a man in a living room chair through his screen door he groans and slumps over . We also saw clips of militants firing at close range at two women huddling in fear under a desk ; spraying bullets at unsuspecting drivers until their cars slow to a halt ; dragging bloodied bodies out of one car and driving it away . At the Nova music festival , we saw young Israelis smiling and dancing ; later , Hamas militants fire at festival goers hiding under cars and then meticulously shoot into a line of portable toilets . They toss hostages bloodied and barely moving into a pile in the back of a pickup truck . During the screening , most journalists sat silently watching . A few peered at the videos through their fingers . At least one was crying . Then there is a chilling cellphone recording the IDF said it retrieved from a call recording app on a phone found at the scene a Hamas fighter call to his parents in Gaza , boasting , \" Dad , I killed 10 Jews with my bare hands . \" \" Mahmood , where are you ? \" his father asks . Mahmood names a kibbutz in southern Israel , adding , \" Please , be proud of me . \" We hear his mother cry in the background , \" Promise you return home ! \" After the viewing , IDF Major General Mickey Edelstein explained why the IDF had invited international journalists there to watch the videos : He said he was \" shocked \" to see some media trying to equate Israel actions in Gaza with Hamas atrocities in Israel . \" Is it equal ? I can not understand such a comparison , \" he said . Israel says Hamas attacks have killed more than people and left wounded . More than two weeks of Israel retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza have killed nearly people and injured almost , according to Gaza Health Ministry , which is run by Hamas . As images of the devastation in Gaza including Palestinian women and children displaced , maimed , killed or weeping for their loved ones have filled the airwaves and social media , Israeli authorities have become keenly aware that the sympathy their country received after the 7 attacks has been waning as international condemnation grows a shift that Hamas appears ready to exploit . \" I think at this point Hamas is winning the information campaign , \" Karin von Hippel , director general of the London based Royal United Services Institute RUSI thinktank , told CBS News . She said that was necessarily because of the militant group own public relations efforts , but because it has many \" multipliers and enablers \" and because of the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza . \" The Israelis need to be incredibly careful because they generated a lot of sympathy from various quarters in the immediate aftermath of the October 7 attacks , \" she said , \" but it appears they killing too many civilians now in Gaza . \" \" We are not fighting the civilians , the kids in Gaza , \" Lt . Col . Hecht told CBS News . \" But this is a very complex situation , and we will make sure Hamas is eradicated . \" When I asked him about criticism that Israel must do more to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza and that it has struck civilians who had evacuated to southern Gaza after Israel warned them to leave the north , Hecht responded that Hamas is \" using their people as human shields Hamas wants their people to get hurt . \" \" We doing everything we can to notify civilians to move , \" he said . \" But you saw the visuals . Hamas came in and they went for anyone they could , and we have the obligation for this not to happen again . We protecting our nation . \" \" Israel is playing catch up , which is why they did the international press briefing , \" said Fran Townsend , who was a National Security Advisor to President George Bush and is now a senior CBS News national security consultant . Townsend added , however , that even if Hamas was commanding the narrative by tapping \" into the heat of emotions in a way governments seem incapable of doing , \" officials in Washington and Israel , \" tend to think that the righteousness of our argument will carry the day . \" When I pointed out to Hecht that many people felt sympathy for Israelis who suffered in the 7 attacks , but they also feel sympathy for Palestinian civilians in Gaza , he said , \" So do we . \" \" But this is a very complex situation , and we will make sure Hamas is eradicated , \" he said . The current \" narrative battle \" is nothing new , noted Von Hippel at RUSI . \" Obviously , there has been a lot of sympathy for the Palestinians over many years and in many parts of the world , and it very easy to rile up that base . \"',\n",

Abdollahian arrival in New York , where the UN headquarters are located , came after the United Nations Security Council failed to address the war during a session on Wednesday , rejecting both US and Russian resolutions on the matter . Speaking to Iranian state media outlet IRNA News upon his arrival , Abdollahian confirmed Iran role in ensuring that the resolution put forward Wednesday by the US , which would have reaffirmed Israel right to defend itself , failed to pass . The work of Iran representative in the United Nations helped ensure that the US resolution be accompanied by vetoes from China and Russia , he said . There were consultations in Tehran two nights ago with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in this regard . Consultations were also held with China , but my colleagues and the honorable ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani in New York worked hard to ensure that this resolution does come to fruition with one sided content . Get The Times of Israel Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up , you agree to the terms The vetoed resolution is not the only way in which the country has influenced the Israel Hamas war , and its involvement began long before October 7 . A report published in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday alleged that hundreds of terrorists from the Gaza Strip underwent specialized combat training in Iran in the run up to the violent massacre . Citing people familiar with the intelligence surrounding October 7 , the newspaper reported that some 500 members of both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad took part in training led by Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps last month . Advertisement Iran support for Hamas has been extensive over the years , with the Iranian government providing the terrorist group with weapons , technology , and financial aid to the estimated tune of 100 million a year , among other things . In addition to its support for Hamas , Iran continues to back other destabilizing forces in the region , including Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza , Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen . Iran has welcomed the Hamas assault but denies it played a role in its planning . According to the WSJ report , Iranian Brig . Esmail Qaani , the head of Quds Force , attended the training activities led by the IRGC . The country influence on the Israel Hamas war , and on the region as a whole , can be seen in the warnings issued against the US and Israel by Iranian officials since October 7 . Earlier this week , the BBC reported that during a press conference in Tehran , Abdollahian warned the US and its proxy Israel that if they do not immediately stop the crime against humanity and genocide in Gaza , anything is possible at any moment and the region will go out of control , Following the Security Council failure to pass a resolution on the Israel Hamas war , a UNGA vote on a draft resolution put forth by Arab states calling for a ceasefire is scheduled to take place on Friday . Advertisement In addition , a Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly has been called for Thursday on the topic of illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory . During his visit , the Iranian foreign minister is expected to meet with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to discuss Iran position on the war , telling IRNA News that the support that the United States and a few European countries blindly but wholeheartedly provide to the Zionist regime has reached a worrying point for all the countries in the region . Abdollahian will also present Iran views during the UNGA Thursday session , where he will reiterate that any resolution passed regarding the war must advocate for the immediate cessation of war crimes and genocide against civilians in Gaza and the West Bank , the immediate and extensive delivery of humanitarian aid and combating the forced relocation of Gaza residents . The Iranian minister sent a letter to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk on Wednesday in which he stressed that Iran expects the United Nations to immediately call for a halt on Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and described the inaction on the part of the international community against the Zionist regime crimes as a catalyst for the Zionist war criminals to intensify their campaign . Israel launched its operation against Hamas 19 days ago , after some terrorists poured into Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7 , killing people , mostly civilians , and injuring some others in a violent massacre . An additional 228 people were taken hostage , of whom just four have been released . In response , Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas from the Gaza Strip , where they have ruled since 2007 , and to destroy the group infrastructure in its entirety . Earlier this week , Israel stopped issuing visas to UN officials after Guterres implied that Hamas October 7 massacre was caused by Israel treatment of Palestinians and Palestinian territories . It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum , he said in his strongly criticized remarks . Advertisement The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation . They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence ; their economy stifled ; their people displaced and their homes demolished . Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing . Contrary to Guterres statement , Israel has not had any military or civilian presence in the Gaza Strip since its unilateral withdrawal in 2005 . Since then , both Israel and Egypt have maintained tight control of Gaza borders in response to the ruling terror group years of rocket fire and attacks against Israel . Following the UN chief comments , Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen canceled a meeting with him , and Minister Benny Gantz branded him a terror apologist . Guterres on Wednesday rejected the criticism and doubled down on his position , saying his remarks had been misrepresented . I am shocked by misrepresentations by some of my statement yesterday in the Security Council as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas , Guterres told reporters , without naming Israel . I spoke of the grievances of the Palestinian people . And in doing so , I also clearly stated , and I quote : But the grievances of the Palestinian people can not justify the appalling attacks by Hamas . Israel Ambassador to the UN , Gilad Erdan , rejected Guterres clarification and reiterated the call for him to resign . Times of Israel staff contributed to this report .',\n",

The meeting is likely to draw condemnation from , whose foreign ministry slammed decision to invite Hamas representatives to Moscow as \" an act of support of terrorism , \" and called for the delegation to be expelled from Russia . The Kremlin had responded by saying that Moscow believes it is necessary to maintain contacts with all parties . The visit of the Iranian deputy foreign minister and the Hamas delegation highlights how Russia is trying to assert its role as a power broker in the Middle East conflict even though it continues to be occupied with its war in Ukraine . It is not clear if representatives from Russia , Iran and Hamas all met together on Thursday . President Vladimir Putin spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , said the Kremlin did not have any contact with Hamas during the visit . Tass reported that Ali Bagheri Kani , Iran deputy foreign minister for political affairs , told Abu Marzouk , who led the Hamas delegation , that Tehran \" priority \" in negotiations \" is an immediate cease fire , providing assistance to the people and lifting the repressive blockade of Gaza . \" On Thursday , Kani also met with Russia Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov , who serves as the Kremlin envoy for the Middle East . The Russian Foreign Ministry said their talks also focused on ceasing hostilities in Gaza and providing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians . In a separate meeting , Bogdanov met the Hamas representative to discuss the release of hostages in the Gaza Strip and the evacuation of foreigners . Although busy with its war in Ukraine , Russia is trying to still take on a key role in the Middle East conflict . Putin declared earlier this month that Moscow could play the role of mediator thanks to its friendly ties with both Israel and the Palestinians , adding that \" no one could suspect us of playing up to one party . \" Despite that claim of even handedness , a UN Security Council resolution that Russia previously submitted condemning violence against civilians made no mention of Hamas . It was rejected by the council . Russia has issued carefully calibrated criticism of both sides in the war between Israel and Hamas as it is trying to balance ties between Israel and Iran , which supports Hamas . Since the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia and Israel have steadily expanded trade and security ties and many Russians moved to Israel after Putin invaded Ukraine . But that invasion has tested relations Israel has voiced support for Kyiv but refused to provide it with weapons , while many Israelis were angered by Putin claim that Ukraine Jewish president , Volodymyr Zelenskyy , is a neo Nazi .

Moments later , the Qatari based satellite channel switched to footage of Dahdouh entering al Aqsa Hospital in Gaza before giving way to grief as he peered over the body of his dead son . Also read Israel Hamas war , Day 20 LIVE updates They take revenge on us in our children ? he said , kneeling over his son bloodied body , still wearing his protective press vest from that day work . Dahdouh grandson also was declared dead two hours later , the network reported . The video was sure to reverberate across the Arab world , where the 53 year old journalist is well known as the face of Palestinians during many wars . He is revered in his native Gaza for telling people stories of suffering and hardship to the outside world . According to Al Jazeera , Dahdouh family members were killed by an Israeli airstrike that hit Nuseirat Refugee Camp , located in an area of Gaza where the military had encouraged people to go to stay safe . It said a number of other relatives were still missing , and it remained unclear how many others were killed . Dahdouh family were among the more than 1 million Gaza residents displaced by the war , now in its day , and were staying in a house in Nuseirat when the strike hit , the network said . The Israeli strikes have killed more than Palestinians , Gaza Health Ministry says . The fighting has killed more than people in Israel mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack , according to the Israeli government . Late Wednesday , Al Jazeera replayed the moment Dahdouh was informed about the deaths . In an audio recording he is heard picking up a phone and telling a frantic caller multiple times : Who are you with ? Earlier , Dahdouh was on air , covering the aftermath of a separate strike that had killed at least 26 people , according to local officials . Throughout the war , Dahdouh has remained in Gaza City , despite Israeli calls for residents to head south ahead of an expected ground offensive . Hundreds of thousands of people have fled to Nuseirat and other locations in central and southern Gaza , believing them to be safer . But Israeli strikes have continued to pound these areas , which are suffering dire shortages of water , medicine and fuel under an Israeli siege . This is the safe area which the occupation army talked about , the moral army , said Dahdouh with bitter sarcasm to a fellow a Al Jazeera reporter at the al Aqsa hospital . In a statement , Al Jazeera said Dahdouh family home was targeted in an indiscriminate assault by the Israeli occupation . The Israeli army had no immediate comment . It says it strikes only Hamas military targets , but the Palestinians say thousands of civilians have died . Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields . Israel has threatened to shut down Al Jazeera over its coverage of the war . Al Jazeera is a Qatari state owned media network , and is deeply critical of Israel , particularly its treatment of Palestinians . Over the last week , the gas rich nation of Qatar has emerged as a key intermediary over the fate of more than 200 hostages captured by Hamas militants during their 7 assault . Qatar has hosted Hamas political office in its capital of Doha for over a decade . The capital , Doha , is home to Ismail Haniyeh , Hamas supreme leader , and also Khaled Mashaal , Haniyeh predecessor . Four of the hostages have been released , a mother and daughter on Friday and two more on Monday . In an interview with Sky News this week , Mashaal said all Israeli hostages could be released if Israel stopped its aerial bombardment of the Gaza .',\n",

              " 'How the US has used its veto power at the UN in support of Israel The US has used its veto power at least 34 times to block UN Security Council resolutions that were critical of Israel . The United Nations Security Council failed to adopt a resolution on the ongoing situation in Gaza after two competing draft resolutions were rejected by member states on Wednesday . Russia and China vetoed a US drafted resolution that called for humanitarian pauses and Israel right to defend itself . A second draft resolution sponsored by Russia , which called for a humanitarian ceasefire , failed to garner enough votes to pass . The United States was expected to veto the resolution had it garnered enough votes to put it on the path to approval . The two resolutions were put to vote on Wednesday at the UN headquarters in New York after an intense open debate by members on the situation in the Middle East , including the Palestinian question . This was the second UNSC draft resolution put to vote since the Israel Palestine war started three weeks ago . The first one was held on October 18 , when the US blocked a resolution calling for humanitarian pauses . Twelve countries voted in favour . A history of US vetoes protecting Israel The US response to the UNSC resolutions amid this conflict is in line with its historical use of its veto power to block any resolutions that might be critical of Israel or call for Palestinian statehood . Since 1945 , a total of 36 UNSC draft resolutions related to Israel Palestine have been vetoed by one of the five permanent members the US , Russia , China , the United Kingdom , and France . Out of these , 34 were vetoed by the US and two by Russia and China . The majority of these resolutions were drafted to provide a framework for peace in the decades long Israel Palestine conflict , including asking Israel to adhere to international laws , calling for self determination for Palestinian statehood , or condemning Israel for the displacement of Palestinians or settlement building in occupied Palestinian territories . The US has vetoed resolutions on Israel a total of 46 times , including over Israel invasion of southern Lebanon as well as Israel annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights , which remains under Israeli occupation . Washington formally recognised Israeli sovereignty in 2019 over the Golan Heights , reversing decades of US policy . The 1972 draft resolution the only time the US did not veto was brief and generic , calling upon all sides to cease immediately all military operations and to exercise the greatest restraint in the interest of international peace and security .

Israel has heavily bombarded the Gaza Strip since Hamas gunmen stormed across its border with Israel and , according to Israeli officials , killed more than people , most of them civilians . The Hamas controlled health ministry said on Wednesday that people have been killed in Gaza since the conflict broke out , including children . \" America is a definite accomplice of criminals , \" said Khamenei during a speech in Tehran . \" The United States is in some way directing the crime that is being committed in Gaza . \" Khamenei said the hands of Americans \" were tainted with the blood of the oppressed , children , patients , women and others \" . The United States , the sworn enemy of Iran , has moved two aircraft carriers into the eastern Mediterranean in a move it says is to deter Iran and Lebanon Hezbollah , both allies of Hamas , from getting involved in the Hamas Israel war . It has also confirmed this week that it has sent a \" few \" military advisers to Israel as part of its support for its close ally . Iran , which financially and militarily backs Hamas , hailed the October 7 attacks on Israel as a \" success \" . But the Islamic republic has insisted it was not involved in the onslaught , during which more than 220 people were also taken hostage , according to Israeli authorities . \" Let everyone know that in this matter and future matters , the Palestinian nation is victorious and the future world is the world of Palestine , not the world of the Zionist regime , \" Khamenei said , referring to Israel . On Tuesday , Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Iran that the United States would respond \" decisively \" to any attack by Tehran proxies , as tensions rise over the conflict . \" The United States does not seek conflict with Iran . We do not want this war to widen , \" Blinken told a UN Security Council session . \" But if Iran or its proxies attack US personnel anywhere , make no mistake . We will defend our people , we will defend our security swiftly and decisively , \" he said .

Just this past week , the PRC vessels acted dangerously and unlawfully as our Philippine friends conducted a routine resupply mission within their own exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea , Biden said at the White House on Wednesday during a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese . I want to be very clear : The United States defense commitment to the Philippines is ironclad , he said . Any attack on the Filipino aircraft , vessels , or armed forces will invoke our Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines . A China Coast Guard vessel collided with a Philippines contracted resupply boat early Sunday as it made its way to a rusting World War II era ship grounded in Second Thomas Shoal more than two decades ago . Two hours later , a Chinese maritime militia boat ran into a Philippine coast guard ship during the same operation to deliver supplies . The remarks from the US president come as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visits Washington this week for high level meetings , including one with Biden on Friday . Meetings are also scheduled with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan as the US and China continue a series of diplomatic engagements intended to manage tensions . China opposes IDF offensive in Gaza , says Israel acting beyond self defence Wang trip is seen as part of an effort that could lay the groundwork for a Biden Xi meeting next month in California . China has repeatedly urged the Philippines to remove the ship known as the BRP Sierra Madre that it said was illegally and deliberately ran aground at the shoal a move Manila took in response to China occupation of nearby Mischief Reef .

REUTERS Anas al Shareef Acquire Licensing Rights Summary Companies LATEST DEVELOPMENTS : Medics and 10 trucks of water , food and medicine enter Gaza says 57 of its relief workers killed so far in Gaza Hamas says Israeli forces attempted beach landing Three wounded in missile strike on Tel Aviv apartment medic GAZA MOSCOW , Oct 27 Reuters A Hamas official tied the release of hostages held in Gaza to a ceasefire in Israel bombardment of the enclave , launched after a deadly rampage by Hamas militants into southern Israel nearly three weeks ago . Israel says it is preparing a ground invasion , but has been urged by the and Arab countries to delay an operation that would multiply the number of civilian casualties in the densely populated coastal strip and might ignite a wider conflict . Two fighter jets struck weapons and ammunition facilities in Syria on Friday in retaliation for attacks on forces by Iranian backed militias since the Gaza war erupted . An opinion poll published on Friday suggested almost half of Israelis now wanted to hold off on a ground invasion out of fears for at least 224 hostages reported to be held there . The Russian newspaper Kommersant quoted a member of a Hamas delegation visiting Moscow as saying time was needed to locate all those who had been abducted by various Palestinian factions in the Hamas attack on 7 . \" They seized dozens of people , most of them civilians , and we need time to find them in the Gaza Strip and then release them , \" Abu Hamid said . He said Hamas , which has freed four hostages so far , had made clear it intended to release \" civilian prisoners \" . But this required a \" calm environment \" , he said , repeating an assertion that Israeli bombing had already killed 50 of those held . Palestinian militants clashed with Israeli troops in at least two areas inside the Gaza Strip , the latest of several small scale incursions , Hamas affiliated media reported , though the Israeli military did not immediately confirm the reports . Residents of central Gaza said they had heard an apparent exchange of fire as well as heavy shelling and air strikes along the border , with Israeli planes dropping flares and bombs . Hamas al Qassam Brigades said Israeli forces had attempted to land on a beach at the southern end of the Strip . Israel said its fighter jets had struck three senior Hamas operatives who played significant roles in the 7 attack , though there was no announcement by Hamas . In early afternoon , rocket sirens sounded throughout southern Israel and an Israeli medic said three people had been wounded when a missile hit an apartment building in Tel Aviv . In the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza , an air strike killed the pregnant wife of a Palestinian lawyer , Jehad Al Kafarnah . \" My life , my heart , I love you , \" Kafarnah wrote , weeping , on the white sheeting wrapped around his wife body . He held the body of her 8 month old stillborn child , also wrapped in white , in his arms . GAZA CIVILIANS GROW MORE DESPERATE As Gaza million civilians grow more desperate under a siege that has cut power and water as well as supplies of food , fuel and medicine , the issue of aid comes before the 193 member General Assembly in New York on Friday . Unlike in the Security Council , where resolutions on aid for Gaza failed this week , there can be no veto on the resolution by Arab states calling for a ceasefire , which will not be binding but carry political weight . The agency for Palestinian refugees , UNRWA , says more than Gazans have been made homeless , at least three times more than its shelters can hold . Ten more trucks of food and medical supplies arrived in Gaza from Egypt , along with 10 foreign doctors the first to enter since Israel tightened its blockade nearly three weeks ago , a Palestinian official said . This made for around 84 trucks in three weeks . The says Gaza needs around 100 relief trucks every day , and the official said negotiations were taking place with Israel , which wants to prevent resources reaching Hamas , to find a faster mechanism . UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said 57 UNRWA workers had been killed in Israeli bombardments , and human rights spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani became emotional when describing conditions for staff : \" Many of them are sleeping out in the open You have to make calculations about whether a ceiling collapsing on you or being hit by shrapnel is more likely to happen . \" A World Food Programme representative said only one of two bakeries it had contracted to feed thousands of displaced families had fuel to make bread , \" and tomorrow there might be none \" . STRIKES SYRIAN BASES USED BY IRANIAN PROXIES Calls for restraint stem not only from concern for Gaza civilians and Israeli hostages , but also fears that the crisis could spark conflict across the Middle East . President Joe Biden ordered overnight strikes on two Syrian bases used by Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps and militias that it backs , the Pentagon said , after issuing a rare direct warning to Iran on Thursday not to attack troops . and coalition troops have been attacked at least 19 times in Iraq and in Syria by Iranian backed forces in the past week . Israel says Hamas killed some people including children in its 7 rampage . The Hamas controlled Gaza health ministry said Palestinians had been killed in the retaliatory air strikes , including around children . Biden has cast doubt on casualty figures provided by Palestinian officials in Gaza , but international aid agencies say they are broadly accurate and have been reliable in the past . In a poll in Israel Maariv newspaper , 49 of Israelis said \" it would be better to wait \" before beginning a large scale ground offensive , while 29 disagreed . A week earlier , 65 had backed a ground invasion . \" It is almost certain that the developments on the matter of the hostages , which is now topping the agenda , have had a great impact on this shift , \" Maariv said .

Mohammad Hussein has been glued to the television in recent weeks , watching Gaza destruction by Israeli air raids . And when an Israeli air raid killed the family of Al Jazeera Gaza Bureau Chief Wael Dahdouh on Wednesday , Hussein watched the story unfold . It a crime , the 45 year old taxi driver said , his left hand fiddling with prayer beads as he sat on a busy throughway in Beirut . And a violation of human rights . On Wednesday , the news broke that Dahdouh family was killed in an attack in southern Gaza . His family had fled northern Gaza to the south on Israel advice but were killed anyway . Dahdouh lost his wife , a daughter , a grandson and a 15 year old son who wanted to follow in his footsteps into journalism . They are among the more than people killed of whom are children in Gaza since the start of the hostilities . The images of Dahdouh entering the morgue and identifying his family members were widely carried on Al Jazeera Arabic . It was shocking news , said Maan Al Haj Ali , a journalist working for Palestine WAFA News Agency . As if he was a member of the family , as if someone very close was broken in front of you . They seek revenge through your children To those in Gaza , Dahdouh presence on their screens has been a constant in recent years . Many in the media praised his work and expressed their sorrow that a man so used to covering the tragedies of others now had to face his own . As a journalist and writer , Wael is a beacon of brave reporting and authentic journalism , Mohammed R Mhawish , a Palestinian journalist and writer based in Gaza , told Al Jazeera . I was listening to the live broadcast when he received the news of the killing of his family members . It shocked me to see him break down on screen . The attack came only a couple of weeks after US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken reportedly told Qatar emir to tone down Al Jazeera Arabic coverage of the war on Gaza . When he saw his slain family , Dahdouh was recorded saying , They seek revenge through our children . The attack is on Wael and his family only , but on the entire people of Gaza , Ahmed al Yazil , a student of media and mass communications in Gaza , said .

Users shared images of a distraught Dahdouh or a clip of the anchor who delivered the news nearly breaking down in tears . My Instagram is filled with people sharing it since yesterday , Aya Mhanna , 38 , a Lebanese clinical psychologist now living in Istanbul , told Al Jazeera . Mhanna said she recognised Dahdouh from his reporting and lamented that the journalist had become the news . It breaks my heart . Even those who had not known his name before Wednesday said the story was on everyone lips . Abdulrahman Bashar Itani sat outside his shop in Beirut next to two other men . I watch all the channels , the sprightly 90 year old said . I did see the news but everyone is talking about it . Itani also brought up Issam Abdallah , the Lebanese Reuters journalist killed in south Lebanon on October 13 . Haram , he said . Why are they targeting journalists ? At least 24 journalists have been killed in the latest round of hostilities , including 20 Palestinians , three Israelis and Lebanon Abdallah . In the West Bank , Palestinians have grown accustomed to Dahdouh presence and reporting on the decades long occupation of Palestine and the genocide of its people . Respect and compassion have flowed as he reels from Israel killing of his family in the south of Gaza . It is shameful for the people who see our children , women and elderly being killed while they are sitting by , Ali , the WAFA journalist , said . As if the children of Palestine are worthless As the eyes of the world have turned to Gaza , Syria is also still suffering air raids , albeit from Russia . Nonetheless , many in Syria were also gripped by the news and took a minute to lend their solidarity . The pain and sorrow felt by Wael were felt by all of us despite our distance from him , Osman al Khader , a lawyer and activist in the Syrian revolution , said . Wael refused to do anything but give us a lesson in patience and courage .

He often reminds me of Shireen Abu Akleh , may she rest in peace , al Sayed said . He added that she was the voice of truth that was killed by the Israeli army gunfire , which continues to kill children and women in plain view of the world . Dahdouh pain was evident for the world to see on Wednesday .

Amirabdollahian also issued a warning in his speech , saying that if Israel rocket strikes into the Gaza Strip in retaliation for Hamas October 7 attack in Israel does not end , then the US will \" not be spared from this fire \" , Reuters reported . \" I say frankly to the American statesmen , who are now managing the genocide in Palestine , that we do not welcome of the war in the region . But if the genocide in Gaza continues , they will not be spared from this fire , \" he said . Amirabdollahian said that Iran is ready to play its part in the \" important humanitarian endeavour \" along with Qatar and Turkey . \" Naturally , the release of the Palestinian prisoners is another necessity and responsibility of the global community , \" he added . Earlier this week , US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told the United Nations that though they do want a conflict with Iran , but Washington would act \" swiftly and decisively \" if Iran or its proxies attacks US personnel anywhere . Blinken statement came amid increasing global fear that the war between Israel and Iran backed Hamas in Gaza could transform into a wider war , involving Lebanon heavily armed Hezbollah , which is also backed by Tehran . Furthermore , the US military is adopting new measures to protect its troops in the Middle East as concerns about attacks by Iran supported groups are increasing , officials told Reuters . The US has sent warships and fighter aircraft to the Middle East in an attempt to thwart Iran and groups backed by the nation , including two aircraft and carriers . Nearly 900 additional troops have either arrived in the Middle East or are en route to the region to bolster air defences for US personnel , Reuters reported on Friday , citing the Pentagon . The deadly war between Israel and Hamas , which entered its day on Friday , has so far claimed more than lives on both sides . It was triggered by the unprecedented and surprise attack by Hamas against Israel on October 7 , in which the terrorist group launched over rockets from the Gaza Strip and also infiltrated into southern Israeli towns , shooting civilians dead on streets and butchering them inside their homes . Israel retaliation counterstrikes has caused a massive humanitarian crisis in Gaza , with world leaders calling for a ceasefire immediately . Hamas has taken around 200 hostages from Israel , and released four so far including two Americans and two Israelis . Edited By : sharangee Published On : Oct 27 , 2023',\n",

              " 'With Congress In Words And Deeds : What The Dussehra Rally Revealed About The New Uddhav Thackeray Two Dussehra rallies took place on Tuesday in Mumbai . One at Shivaji Park where Uddhav Thackeray spoke . The second one was at Azad Maidan where CM Eknath Shinde addressed his supporters . In Shivaji Park , the crowd at Uddhav Thackeray Dussehra rally was nowhere near expected . While the crowd was humongous at Shiv Sena rally in Azad Maidan too , Chief Minister Eknath Shinde was flanked by a large group of elected representatives on the stage . These leaders were MLAs , MPs , and even the deputy chair of Maharashtra Legislative Council . Uddhav fears Uddhav Thackeray speech for the Dussehra rally appeared to be written by a new writer this time . The buzz going around is that it was his son , Aaditya , who had a major role in deciding some of the key points that Uddhav raised in his address . His direct attack on Adani , in relation the Dharavi Redevelopment Project , especially came as a surprise because the Thackeray have had good connections with the business families . They are regulars at events hosted by the Ambanis and barely a few days ago when the Adani group secured the tender for the Dharavi redevelopment , Gautam Adani had visited Uddhav at his residence . So what explains Thackeray attack ? One reason could be that Uddhav wants to visibly align himself with what Rahul Gandhi has been saying for the last few years . Also , Aaditya has opposed multiple development projects earlier too . For example , he was vocal in opposing the Carshed for Mumbai Metro at Aarey , in spite of his party being in the ruling alliance then . Over and above this though , Uddhav speech exposed a fear that he has probably realized will soon come true . Thackeray in his speech spoke about how only a coalition government will be formed in the state . This betrays that Uddhav knows he will never be able to get a majority or a large numbers of MLAs in his camp in future elections . Many who have followed Uddhav would consider the above statement as a case of the author reading too much into a standard political speech , but the truth is that this is probably is the first time when Uddhav has openly said so . Before this , he would always say that chief minister would be from his party and would rarely give any importance to coalition . Uddhav also expressed his dissatisfaction with his own former party colleague , and now Speaker of Maharashtra Assembly , Rahul Narvekar . He accused Narvekar of purposely delaying the verdict on the disqualification plea . He also focused on the Maratha reservation issue , and accused the BJP and Chief Minister for not acting on it on purpose . Meanehile , what was missing at Uddhav rally was visible at Shinde rally , Shinde was flanked by the same Shiv Sena leaders who were seen on the stage during Dussehra rallies when Balasaheb Thackeray would address them . Shinde attacked Uddhav where he knew it would hurt the most . He spoke about corruption , and called Uddhav government as Lena Bank . On Uddhav recent political statements and allies , Shinde said that he who has already joined hands with Congress and Samajwadi Party , can also ally with the AIMIM and hug Hamas . Uddhav Thackeray , since he joined hands with Congress and Sharad Pawar , has managed to position himself as the next big leader for the minority community and has got a good following amongst them . Shinde pointed out the same in his speech . He also put a full stop to speculations that his government was in any danger and he being unhappy with Ajit Pawar inclusion in it . On the contrary , he claimed that Pawar becoming a part of the government has strengthened him . Shinde , also professed his confidence in PM Modi and claimed that BJP Sena NCP alliance will win 45 seats of the 48 in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections . A figure close to what those on ground have been predicting . In the run up to Dussehra , Shinde was accused of being soft on Uddhav , for not fighting for Shivaji Park and settling for Azad Maidan for his rally . But he explained that he is the CM of the state and he would take any step that will endanger the peace of the state and hence , he chose an alternative . In the political theatre of Maharashtra , Tuesday stage was put in Mumbai . In his act , Uddhav Thackeray unexpected rhetoric revealed strategic shifts , possibly influenced by his son , Aaditya . Meanwhile , Eknath Shinde exuded the sense of being in control , all while countering Thackeray narrative . The stage is set , alliances forged , as Maharashtra walks into 2024 when it holds both the Parliamentary and Assembly elections .',\n",
              " 'Shashi Tharoor Hamas reference at IUML pro Palestine rally triggers political row in Kerala October 27 , 2023 pm Updated pm IST Thiruvananthapuram Congress Working Committee CWC member Shashi Tharoor , MP , appeared to have put his party in an awkward spot by purportedly referring to Hamas as a terrorist organisation at the mammoth rally organised by the Indian Union Muslim League IUML in Kozhikode on October 26 , 2023 to proclaim solidarity with the Palestine cause . Congress leadership in Kerala was yet to react to the contentious usage , which drew onstage criticism from IUML leaders Muneer , MLA , and Abdussamad Samadani . Both termed their opposition to Israel expansionist policies in Gaza and the West Bank as legitimate resistance . IUML is a staunch Congress ally and a prominent constituent in the United Democratic Front UDF Opposition in Kerala . Speech cherry picked On October 27 Friday , Tharoor denied the imputation . He said some quarters had cherry picked his speech to inject parochial politics into a global humanitarian cause . He said the address was solidly and unequivocally pro Palestine when viewed in its entirety . IUML national general secretary Kunhalikutty , MLA , sought to end the row . He welcomed Tharoor clarification and said provincial politics had no bearing on the IUML decision to rally public opinion in favour of Palestine oppressed , starved , and terrorised people . He said the IUML had invited Tharoor as the chief guest to the rally in recognition of his global experience and international stature . The IUML would defeat efforts to rob the pro Palestine rally relevance , political message and sheen . Communist Party of India Marxist State secretariat member Swaraj was bitingly critical of Tharoor speech . In a Facebook post , Swaraj alleged that Tharoor had used the IUML public platform to relay his solidarity with Israel . Tharoor appeared to imply somewhat reductively that the incendiary Palestine problem had its genesis in Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 . And the current genocidal attacks on the besieged people of Palestine were Israel legitimate response . Tharoor seemed pointedly disinclined to term Israel a terrorist nation , wrote Swaraj . Left independent legislator and a sharp critic of the IUML , Jaleel , MLA , said the IUML rally seemed to express solidarity with expansionist and imperialistic Israel and its backers instead of solidly rallying behind the tyrannised and terrorised people of Palestine . State secretary Govindan seemed to take a relatively softer line , given the party outreach to minority communities to whittle the electoral prospects of the right wing Bharatiya Janata Party BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and its empathy towards the anti BJP INDIA bloc opposition partnership . Govindan seemed reluctant to confront Tharoor by stating that the Congress leader had explained . Govindan also seemed to pussyfoot around whether the party viewed Hamas as a terrorist outfit . He merely said the stance on the Palestine question was clear . Last week , Govindan had fielded the same question by stating that he would not elaborate on Hamas class nature . I am not going to elaborate on the class nature of Hamas . The is concerned about the rights of the Palestinian people . Communists reckon them as an oppressed class and exiles in their land . A hostile Israel has hedged in Palestine from three sides . Palestinians have only the sea to flee to , Govindan had said . Suresh Gopi support Tharoor found some support in BJP leader Suresh Gopi , who termed Hamas a terrorist organisation inimical to the welfare of Palestinians . Tharoor would not make an off the cuff statement , Gopi said . BJP State president Surendran appeared to take a harsher line against Tharoor and the IUML . He called the rally an open display of support for Hamas , a terrorist outfit that massacred Israeli civilians . Tharoor had no business attending the rally that went against the grain of India stance on the issue in the United Nations , Surendran said .',\n",
              " 'Why Tharoor comments on Hamas and terror from a Muslim League stage are significant In March 2022 , when the Congress ally Indian Union Muslim League IUML top leadership went into a huddle at Panakkad House in Malappuram to anoint Sadiq Ali Shihab Tangal as the new party chief succeeding his departed elder brother Sayyid Hyderali Shihab Tangal , there was only one non IUML leader on the occasion : Shashi Tharoor . The Congress Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram had gone to pay his last respects to Sayyid Hyderali Shihab Tangal , when the IUML leadership requested him to stay on as they went through the motion of handing over Sadiq Ali the reins of the party . It is rare for any party to allow an outsider to attend such a crucial , high level meeting . Advertisement Last November , when Tharoor undertook a tour of Malabar soon after he lost the profile contest against Mallikarjun Kharge for the Congress president post , he went to Panakkad and held discussion with Sadiq Ali Thangal before attending an interaction with students of the Hyderali Shihab Thangal Academy for Civil Services , an institution run by the Muslim League . Tharoor , in many ways , shares a very cordial relationship with the Muslim League leadership . Hence his reference to Hamas as terrorists , in the context of its October 7 attacks on Israel , at a Palestine solidarity rally organised by the IUML in Kozhikode on Thursday surprised many despite the point that his views on Hamas are well known . No one should underestimate the depth of concern among large sections of the Indian public about the ongoing violence the dangers of it worsening . India is one of the handful of countries that maintains Ambassadors in both Israel Palestine and enjoys good relations with both . Shashi Tharoor October 27 , 2023 Tharoor was among the first Congress leaders to call the Hamas attack a terror act . There is never any excuse for terrorism and India must condemn it unreservedly . But there is no excuse for dehumanizing occupation either and that too must end . Both the Israeli people and the Palestinans deserve to live in peace , dignity and security in their own lands , Tharoor had said in a post on X on October 8 even as the Congress officially refrained from using the word terror . The Indian National Congress condemns the brutal attacks on the people of Israel . The Indian National Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self respect , equality and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people . Violence of any type never provides a solution and must stop , Congress communication head Jairam Ramesh had said in a post on X on October 8 . Advertisement Tharoor was one of the leaders who had argued in the October 9 meeting of the Congress Working Committee CWC that its resolution should condemn the Hamas attack on Israel , name the outfit and use the word terror . Advertisement That Tharoor reiteration of Hamas as terrorists came at a pro Palestine IUML rally in Kerala makes it more significant , politically . And it is not just the Muslim League . The mainstream political parties in Kerala across the political divide have traditionally backed the Palestinian cause and often slammed Israel for its aggression . Advertisement However , despite speaking his mind , Tharoor , the diplomat turned politician , was cautious . He made it a point at the IUML rally to argue that the conflict in the Middle East should not be framed as a Muslim issue , rather it was a matter of human rights . He also condemned the bombing of Gaza by Israel . In fact , he called both the attacks by Hamas on Israel , and by Israel on Gaza as acts of terrorism . Senior Muslim League leader M K Muneer , speaking after Tharoor , repeated his party line that the fight of Palestinians was nothing less than a freedom struggle and we should be able to differentiate between defence and attack . Advertisement Tharoor and the IUML may agree to disagree but the point that the IUML invited Tharoor as the keynote speaker at the event despite his pronounced views on the issue reflected the bond between the Congress leader and the Muslim League leadership . It is to be seen whether Tharoor rivals in the Congress in Kerala and there are many would use his Hamas remark to target him again . Interestingly , Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had mentioned Hamas in his first statement on the raging war a few days ago but he too had chosen not to use the word terrorism . He said the Congress had condemned the brutal attacks by Hamas on the people of Israel and argued also unacceptable are the indiscriminate actions by Israel military forces in civilian areas , that includes a siege of the Gaza Strip and bombings in it . Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too slammed Israel on Friday . In a post on X , she said that even after the killing of people in Gaza , the cycle of bloodshed and violence has not stopped . Out of these people , were innocent children , she noted . There is no international law that has not been trampled upon . There is no such limit which has not been crossed . There is no such rule which has not been flouted When will humanity wake up ? After losing how many lives . After sacrificing how many children . Does the consciousness of being human remain ? Did it ever exist ? Priyanka stated .',\n",

The rally was organised by the Indian Union Muslim League , an ally of the Congress . Tharoor speech at the rally on the ongoing Israel Palestine conflict dragged him into a fresh controversy as CPM criticised Tharoor calling Hamas attack on Israel a terrorist strike . \" Tharoor is not a man who does not know the meaning of words . He is also not a person who was unaware that history had not begun on October 7 , \" CPM leader M Swaraj alleged . Tharoor in reply said he is bemused that out of his 32 minute speech , only 25 seconds were highlighted to attack him . \" If that all it takes to negate my support for the human rights of the Palestinian people , then I have nothing more to say , \" Tharoor said . Shashi Tharoor was the guest speaker at a pro Palestine rally in Kozhikode . The Congress leader was caught in the same Israel Palestine controversy as he earlier pointed out that PM Modi first statement after Hamas October 7 attack on Israel had no mention of Palestine . Tharoor was also criticised for not calling Hamas a terrorist organisation in a television interview which he said was consistent with India approach to Hamas . The new controversy is over Tharoor calling Hamas terrorists at a pro Palestine rally . CPM leader Swaraj said Tharoor did an Israel solidarity meeting at the expense of the IUML . The Congress in its official statement reaffirmed support for Palestine and condemned the Hamas attack on Israel . India official stand is that India condemns terror attack and supports for the establishment of a \" sovereign , independent and viable state of Palestine . IUML leader MK Muneer at the rally said Bhagat Singh and Subhas Chandra Bose were also called terrorist in British history . When Bhagat Singh and Subhas Chandra Bose fought for the freedom of the country , it was recorded in British history as an act of terrorism and extremism . At Gaza , the fight of Palestine for freedom would be an act of terrorism in the eye of imperialistic forces . But the children at Gaza now say that they were now offering namaz not five times a day , but six times . The children say every day they have janaza funeral prayer . The fight of Palestine is freedom struggle and that of Israel is genocide . We are with that defence of Palestine . We should be able to differentiate between defence and attack , Muneer said .

              " 'IUML Rally : Muslim league holds massive pro Palestine rally in Kerala , calls Israel a terror state KOZHIKODE : Tens of thousands of people converged on Kozhikode beach on Thursday afternoon in the largest pro Palestine rally to take place in the country which was organized by IUML ever since the Palestine conflict . Chanting Solidarity with Palestine and Down with Zionism and holding banners which were written even in Arabic which read Indians with Palestine , End the Genocide in Gaza , IUML activists , including hundreds of women , formed a sea of humanity along the beach . Inaugurating the rally , IUML state president Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal said that Israel was the biggest terrorist nation in the world and added that the Indian government was trying to whitewash Israel . Thangal said that while all the Prime Ministers from Jawaharlal Nehru to Manmohan Singh , including even A B Vajpayee , had sided with justice and had taken a stand against Israeli occupation of Palestine , the current central government was trying to dilute that stand and whitewash Israel . However , Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who was the chief guest at the function , in his keynote address tacitly referred to Hamas as terrorists which prompted a response from IUML leader M K Muneer . \" Terrorists attacked Israel on October 7 and killed people and took 200 as hostages and in retaliation Israel has killed over people in the bombings carried out in Gaza which has still not stopped , \" Tharoor said , however , adding that the Israeli response to the attack was disproportionate and in contravention of the human rights conventions . \" When the terrorists killed innocent children and women , the world condemned it . Now , we the world , including all of us , are condemning the Israeli bombings as well , \" Tharoor said . However , Tharoor remarks prompted a response from Muneer . Without naming Tharoor , Muneer said in his speech that when Bhagat Singh and Subhas Chandra Bose fought for the independence of the country , their actions were termed as extremism and terrorism by the British and likewise the fight for independence of Palestine in Gaza is being portrayed by the imperial forces as terrorism . \" It is fight for independence by Palestinians but what Israel is doing is ethnic genocide . We are with the resistance of the people of Palestine , and we should be able to identify between resistance and attack , \" Muneer said . \" Just because this rally is organized by IUML , one should not think that it is a Muslim issue . It is a human rights issue . The bombs fall on people irrespective of their religion , \" Tharoor said , adding that it might well be one of the most important political rallies seen in India and perhaps across the world in defence of human rights and in favour of peace . The rally began with Sadikali Thangal reciting prayers for peace in Palestine . IUML national secretary P K Kunhalikutty presided over . IUML had also intended to make the rally party show of strength and the influence the Thangal family holds among the Muslim community . The party had not invited any of the Muslim organisations , including Samastha . However Samastha frontal organization leader Nazer Faizi Koodathayi attended the programme .',\n",

Tharoor clarified that he was with the people of Palestine . He also said that a portion of his speech was being used to unleash a misleading campaign that he backed Israel .

              " 'Vandita Mishra writes : Is TMC MP Mahua Moitra guilty that is not the question Dear Express Reader , The allegations against Trinamool Congress MP from Krishnanagar , Mahua Moitra , are certainly serious . She is accused of taking cash and expensive gifts from a businessman , Darshan Hiranandani , with whom she allegedly shared her Parliament login and password , for asking questions in the House . The matter is with the Ethics Committee of Lok Sabha , and there are several steps to go before guilt or innocence can be proved or disproved . Advertisement And yet , you might ask , is anyone really waiting for the verdict that will come after the due process of law plays out in full . Is the truth , or untruth , of the allegations against MP Moitra whose party , by the way , appears to have abandoned her to face them alone at the heart of this matter ? In times of social media , and with an important set of elections round the corner , the cash for query case has already achieved two things it arguably intended to it has thrown a large question mark at an articulate member of the Opposition who may be a political lightweight but who has stood up in Parliament , again and again , to ask questions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the House of Adani . And in so doing , it has underlined , ahead of an electoral campaign for five states , an opposition that the BJP has vigorously sought to paint and project for some time of Modi versus Them , the latter category comprising those who are in the dock , from Rahul Gandhi , who nearly lost his membership of Parliament to a conviction in a criminal defamation case , to the AAP arrested trio , Satyendra Jain , Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh , to the now embattled MP of the TMC . The impatience with and disregard for the process of justice that is visible in the Moitra case can not just be attributed to an older syndrome comprising people short attention spans and parties smear campaigns shifting the onus of proving their innocence on to the accused . It is compounded by at least two more recent factors : The first is a dominant player like the BJP , which nurtures an abiding sense of siege and casts itself in the role of righteous insurgent . Advertisement The BJP bears a deep grudge against the System and its institutions and norms that it felt shut out of for the decades the Congress presided over it . It is now armed with both the power and the drive to knock them down and recreate them in its Leader interest and image . This combines with the second factor the waning credibility of almost all mediating institutions that could have salvaged less hijackable notions of truth and upheld impersonal norms in the space between Leader and the people . Advertisement It did not need the Modi government slamming a case under the stringent anti terror law , UAPA , against a news portal to draw attention to just how vulnerable a place the media as a whole finds itself in today not only can it be targeted by a power drunk government , it also finds it increasingly difficult to access , in its defence , an institutional cache of goodwill and credibility built over decades . Advertisement The latter has been eroded partly because of the past and present abdications of a section of the media itself , and partly because of the multiple onslaughts on it in the present social media age . A competition has been set up , on an unlevel playing field , between journalism and its more eye catching and much more polarising hit and run variant . The media authority and truth telling has been displaced by a noisy , anything goes battle of narratives . In this scenario , it is not just Moitra who stands the risk of being judged many times over before she has a chance to argue her case . As election campaigns get going on the ground , important issues from Israel vs Palestine , to the Supreme Court marriage equality verdict at home most recently are also likely to get cavalier treatment . These are complex issues there are victims and villains , more victims than villains , on both sides of the divide in the tortured and prolonged confrontation between Israel and Palestine , and there can be no excuse for using the conflict for minority baiting at home . The Court withholding recognition to same sex marriage raises complicated questions about social and constitutional morality , and the lag between the two . But the ability of society and polity to navigate thorny issues is being severely compromised by the potent combination of a ruling party that calls on both to only trust and follow the Leader , whom it puts at the centre of every denuded frame , and the depleted capacity , for now , of the mediating and countervailing institutions that could have invited and hosted a wider and more open ended conversation and debate .

While Tharoor said that innocent women and children had suffered casualties , initially in Israel and subsequently in Gaza , he also condemned the October 7 multi pronged attack by Hamas on Israel . The Congress leader said that this was not an issue confined to Muslims alone , but a matter of fundamental human rights . \" The bomb falls without asking anyone religion . Christians constitute one to two percent of the Palestinian population . They too have perished in this conflict , \" he asserted . Tharoor remarks later caused a controversy after leader and former MLA M Swaraj alleged that some of Tharoor remarks were pro Israel , and the Congress MP failed to admit that Israel was a \" terrorist nation \" . Taking a dig at Tharoor , Swaraj , a state secretariat member of the , said what he had done was an \" Israel solidarity meeting at the expense of the IUML \" . \" Tharoor is not a man who does not know the meaning of words . He is also not a person who was unaware that history had not begun on October 7 , \" Swaraj further said .',\n",

Balasaheb Thackeray used to talk about the country and the people . But his Shinde entire speech was about strengthening the BJP , strengthening Modi ji , strengthening JP Nadda ji , \" he said . \" It was Dussehra yesterday , an auspicious day . We should talk about auspicious things . But you are talking about these things . He Shinde is Hamas , Al Qaeda of Maharashtra . He betrayed the Shiv Seva that gave birth to him in politics , promoted him till he became the chief minister , \" Raut added . Shinde , in his Dussehra speech , also questioned Shiv Sena UBT alliance formed with Akhilesh Yadav Samajwadi Party , that he claimed had resorted to using bullets against karsevaks . The reference was to a 1990 incident , when Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav had instructed police officials to open fire on karsevaks in Ayodhya , aiming to deter them from advancing towards the Babri Masjid . Thackeray and Shinde , leaders of the split factions of the Shiv Sena , organized separate Dussehra rallies this year in Mumbai for the first time in the history of the party .

He reiterated that he always stood for the Palestinian cause . Taking to X , the Thiruvananthapuram MP wrote : Somewhat bemused to learn of the attacks on me by those who , out of a 32 minute speech , have chosen to dwell on the 25 seconds in which I denounced the terrorist attacks of October 7 that triggered the current cycle of violence disproportionate retribution . If that all it takes to negate my support for the human rights of the Palestinian people , then I have nothing more to say . However , he did not elaborate on the criticism for terming the Palestinian actions terrorist attacks . At a Palestine solidarity rally organised by Congress ally Muslim League in Kozhikode on Thursday evening , Tharoor termed the Hamas action on Israel on October 7 a terrorist attack .

              " 'Khokasur , General Dyer : Uddhav Thackeray , Eknath Shinde Trade Barbs at Dussehra Rallies For the second year in a row , two factions of Shiv Sena held Dussehra rallies in two different parts of Mumbai on Tuesday where Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and former CM Uddhav Thackeray engaged in a war of words . Launching scathing attacks on Shinde , Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray referred to him as Khokasur and General Dyer , who ordered firing on a gathering of Indians in a compound called Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar , Punjab during in then British ruled India . The Thackeray faction has alleged that Shinde , who rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray in 2022 , took crores of money or several khokhas to switch sides . Raavan too was a Shiv Bhakt . But Ram had to kill him as he had become egoistic Khokasur . We will finish them . They are scared that why they have stolen the bow and arrow as well Lathicharge in Jalna like General Dyer . You have been so heartless . Maratha agitation was there when I was the CM too . Did the police use and brutality ? Who is the Dyer of Jalna ? he asked . Addressing Shiv Sena workers at Shivaji Park , Thackeray said the BJP is trying to divide people on the basis of caste . BJP will eat a full meal in a wedding , as an uninvited guest , and will get the groom married to someone else before going . They go with anyone for their interest , he added . The Supreme Court has been slamming them every now and then , but they are still shameless . Will the Constitution , and the Supreme Court exist now ? Will or democracy survive ? We will see what happens on the . People have already decided who has been disqualified . I challenge them . They should hold the elections before taking a decision on the disqualification plea , he said . Thackeray further said the country needs a strong government but not of one party with a brute majority . He said when the chair of ruler is unstable , the country becomes strong . We Gave Up Power For Hindutva : Shinde Shinde , who addressed Shiv Sena workers at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai , slammed Thackeray for forming an alliance with Congress and the Samajwadi Party while burying Hindutva thoughts of late Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray . At one time Bal Thackeray gave the slogan Garvase kaho hum Hindu hai say with pride we are Hindu , but now the new slogans being shouted at Shivaji Park are Garvase kaho hum Congressi hai , Garvase kaho hum Samajwadi hai . In future , Uddhav Thackery would form an alliance with the AIMIM and embrace even Hamas , Hizbul , will meet Lashkar e Taiba for power , he said . Shinde said he would never compromise for a seat for power . Shiv Sainiks have come from Maharashtra today , this is a saffron wave . This Azad gathering is being held today at Azad Maidan . Azad Maidan also has a history . Shiv Sena Dussehra gathering is being held on Azad Maidan . People have come since dawn . We are respecting other communities , respecting them too , we are moving ahead , he said . We will never compromise for a seat for power and therefore today Abdul Sattar is also a minister in our cabinet , he himself came with the workers in an ST car and he sat with the workers . I congratulate him from the bottom of my heart and thank him , he added . Without taking Uddhav Thackeray name , the Chief Minister said his love is not for Balasaheb thoughts but for money . We gave up power for Hindutva , it became helpless for power , Balasaheb did not take it to us . After the Election Commission came to us with the party and the symbol , they asked the bank for Rs 50 crore . The bank refused him . Then he shamelessly asked me for money . Accusing us of 50 boxes and demanding 50 crores from us . Your love is not for Balasaheb thoughts but for money . So I paid that money without thinking for a moment , he said . Shinde promised that he would make sure to give Maratha a reservation that would stand legally . I am committed to giving Maratha reservations without doing injustice to any community . I take the oath of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj . I request people not to take any extreme steps , your family is behind you . As long as even a single drop of blood is left in my body , I will work for the Maratha reservation . The committee that has been formed has been working on this for 24 hours , he said .',\n",

The rally was organised by IUML . The IUML activists , including hundreds of women , chanted \" Solidarity with Palestine \" and \" Down with Zionism \" on the beach , and held banners inscribed in Arabic that read \" Indians with \" and \" End the genocide in Gaza \" . Inaugurating the rally , IUML state president Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal said \" Israel was the biggest terrorist nation \" in the world and added that the Indian government was \" trying to whitewash \" . Thangal said that while all Indian PMs , from Jawaharlal Nehru to Manmohan Singh , including Atal Bihari Vajpayee , had sided with justice and had taken a stand against the Israeli occupation of Palestine , the current central government was trying to dilute that stand . However , Congress MP Shashi , who was the chief guest at the event , tacitly referred to Hamas as terrorists in his address , drawing a response from IUML leader M K Muneer . \" Terrorists attacked Israel on October 7 and killed people and took 400 as hostages , and in retaliation Israel has killed over people in bombings carried out in Gaza , which have still not stopped , \" Tharoor said , adding , that the Israeli response to the attack was disproportionate and in contravention of human rights conventions .

              " 'Mint Explainer : Decoding India reaction to Qatar death sentence to 8 Indians India strong , if unremarkable , relationship with Qatar may be in for a rough spell after a court in the Arab country sentenced eight Indian naval veterans to death . While Qatar has not made the charges public , media reports indicate that the men were held for espionage . Mint looks at the case and its implications for India Qatar ties . Case background In August 2022 , eight former naval veterans were arrested by Qatar and held in solitary confinement . No clear charges or reasons for their arrest were made public . The men were employees of Al Dahra , a consulting firm working with Qatar military . Media reports , citing government and intelligence sources , say that the eight men were arrested on charges of espionage . The trial began in March this year and on Thursday , India Ministry of External Affairs said that a Qatari court had sentenced the eight men to death . India Qatar relations : A snapshot Historically , India and Qatar have enjoyed a favourable relationship . Energy , especially liquefied natural gas LNG exports from Qatar to India , is a significant component of their trade relationship , which was valued at 5 billion in 2021 22 . Investment avenues have always been open , with Qatar investing 1 billion in Reliance Retail and its FDI in India growing five times since 2020 . Defence is another key area , marked by India offering training to Qatari forces and a defence cooperation agreement signed in 2008 . Qatar is also home to Indian workers . High level visits from leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi , vice presidents Dhankar and Naidu , and external affairs minister S Jaishankar further emphasize the closeness . India reaction India response to the verdict has been measured . The country leadership has refrained from publicizing the issue or criticizing Qatar overtly . New Delhi has consistently stressed the importance of the well being of the detained men , ensuring it does appear as intervention in Qatar legal affairs . The Indian Foreign Ministry official response has been subdued , saying that they will continue liaising with Qatari officials and support the affected families . Some experts suggest that India might work towards a governmental resolution for the detainees . It been noted that earlier attempts by Indian intelligence to convince Qatari security about the detainees innocence were successful . Potential impact on bilateral relations It uncertain how this will influence India Qatar ties . India restrained approach suggests it cautious about affecting its economic and energy ties with Qatar . However , this stance might be tested if there a significant domestic uproar in India over the issue . A significant twist , as reported by ThePrint , claims the detained men were suspected of relaying information about Qatar classified submarine project to Israel . This revelation , if true , could complicate matters , especially considering concerns that Qatar might share its submarine tech with Pakistan , a close ally .',\n",
              " 'India Canada Row : Surprise , Surprise ! New Zealand , Another Of The \" Five Eyes , \" Predictably Blinks However , the contents of the post should be a cause for explanation from a country that is part of the \" Five Eyes , \" an intelligence sharing alliance between the United States , United Kingdom , Australia , Canada , and New Zealand . As turmoil found another residence on the world map with the Israel Hamas conflict , a recent X post from New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs Trade flew under the radar . Australia , Canada , and the United Kingdom servile behaviour towards the Khalistani elements within the Sikh communities in their nations is well known and well documented . However , what has been going unnoticed is the way New Zealand is increasingly becoming a stage for the dangerous and violent extremism that characterises the Khalistan movement . Earlier this month , three people were convicted overwhelmingly by a 12 bench jury one with an 11 1 verdict finding the accused guilty for the attempted murder of radio show host Harnek Singh . What happened at the trial raises questions about a civilised nation understanding of crime . The defence attorney of one of the guilty parties had argued that Harnek Singh was a \" professional provocateur \" and purveyor of \" clickbait , \" as if almost trying to justify the attack . The trial was originally held against five people , two of whom were let go for lack of evidence . If anyone has heard Harnek Singh show , he has openly criticised the Khalistani movement and reminded people of the horrors committed by the Khalistani militants on ordinary people during the dark era in Punjab . While he may be considered critical of orthodoxy , it has always been about Harnek Singh criticising Khalistan and the terrorists fighting for the cause . Given his wide audience around the world , thanks to YouTube , it is not surprising that he got a mark painted behind his back . This trial , however , has only brought to surface the unnoticed politics of Khalistan being played out in gurdwaras and New Zealand Sikh community . Just four days earlier , the Sikh Press Association , a Khalistani propaganda site , put out a release about New Zealand Sikhs demanding a formal independent investigation by the New Zealand government into Indian interference in the country . This call for the demand , reported from an assembly of 200 people at Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib in Auckland , saw representatives of New Zealand Sikh Youth , Sikh Aspirations and Gurdwara sevadaars gather , with virtual appearances by Canadian speakers , British Columbia Gurdwaras Council spokesperson Bhai Moninder Singh , and legal advocate Bhai Prabjot Singh , editor of Panth Punjab . In April this year , there was news of the arrest of Baltej Singh nephew of Satwant Singh , one of Indira Gandhi assassins . He was arrested as part of a drug racket bust carried out by the Auckland Police . Baltej Singh was allegedly known to have been involved in pro Khalistan activities in New Zealand , and had amassed huge amounts of wealth through drug peddling . Meanwhile , propaganda flows unabated in New Zealand about \" Hindutva terror . \" A story by Ripu Bhatia from earlier this year talked about Sikhs afraid to go back to India , claiming they are becoming marginalised by the Hindu centric rhetoric and policies of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi . It is ironic , though , that the reason for fear is supporting Dubai based truck business owner who has turned into an extremist and secession advocate , Amritpal Singh Sandhu , with the fear of getting blacklisted by Indian authorities . While the story was full of unsubstantiated claims , it was fascinating to see how the quoted person was a spokesperson for Waris Punjab De , Amritpal Singh Sandhu organisation . In fact , a month prior to this story , a protest had been carried out in Auckland against the arrest of Amritpal Sandhu in Aotearoa . Of course , this is not new . The politics of Khalistan in gurdwaras of New Zealand is common . Videos can be seen of gurdwaras across New Zealand where pictures of Khalistani militants and Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale gloriously adorn walls , with some pictures even bigger than that of historical figures like Baba Deep Singh . For instance , in Gurdwara Kalgidhar Sahib in Takanini , which has one of the largest Sikh populations outside Auckland , one can see pictures of Bhindranwale , Satwant Singh , Gurdev Singh Kounke , and Harjinder Singh Jinda among others .',\n",

Most of the arrested men had been working at Dahra for four to six years at the time of their arrests . When were the men arrested by the Qatari authorities , and why ? The men were picked up by the State Security Bureau , the Qatari intelligence agency . The Indian Embassy first learnt about the arrests in mid September last year . On September 30 , the men were allowed brief telephonic contact with their family members . The first consular access a visit by an official of the Indian embassy was granted on October 3 , more than a month after they were taken into custody .

The charges against the men were never made public , but the fact they were put in solitary confinement led to speculation that they had been detained in connection with a security related offence . What is the nature of the relationship between India and Qatar ? The two countries have had friendly relations for decades . Since Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visit to Qatar in November 2008 , the first by an Indian Prime Minister , the relationship has burgeoned . The Emir of Qatar , Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani , visited India in 2015 , and Prime Minister Narendra Modi went to Qatar in 2016 . External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has visited the country on at least three occasions . The late Sushma Swaraj became the first Indian Foreign Minister to visit Qatar in 2018 . In 2021 , India was among the top four export destinations for Qatar ; it is also among the top three sources of Qatar imports . The bilateral trade is valued at 15 billion , which is mostly LNG and LPG exports from Qatar worth over 13 billion . Advertisement Defence co operation has been officially described as a pillar of Indian Qatar ties . The India Qatar Defence Cooperation Agreement , signed during Prime Minister Singh November 2008 visit , was a significant turning point . The agreement was extended for another five years in 2018 . A paper published by the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses IDSA at the time quoted reports of Indian officials describing the agreement as just short of stationing troops . The pact included training of the QENF by India , as well as mutual visits . Advertisement Indian Naval and Coast Guard ships regularly visit Qatar . QENF delegations participated in two maritime exercises in India in 2021 . Two editions of a joint naval exercise called Zair Al Bahr have been held .

He is a staunch Congress supporter . He is a companion of Mahatma Gandhi , Jawaharlal Nehru , Indira Gandhi , Rajiv Gandhi , Narasimha Rao and others . However , do not insist that certain truths should not be told . Those in Palestine are also humans . All war and killing must end . No terrorist should reign here and remain .

              " 'Carrot or stick : What can India do to seek concessions from Qatar on espionage row ? Qatar on Thursday Oct 27 surprised New Delhi by sentencing eight Indian nationals to death after a court found them guilty of spying for Israel . The eight men were working for a Qatari firm Dahra Global , which was linked to the Qatari military and reportedly advising it on a top secret submarine programme . The Qatari intelligence accused these eight Indians of passing on secret data to Israel and subsequently detained them in August last year . Reportedly , the owner of the firm , a retired member of the Royal Omani Air Force , was also arrested by Qatar along with the eight men but was released in November last year . Watch : Qatar court announces death sentence to eight Indian workers The Indian government expressed deep shock at the verdict , adding that all legal options are being explored . The development risks triggering a diplomatic dispute between the two nations , who share deep trade and people to people ties . What legal options are available to India ? The Indian government Thursday said it was following the matter closely and would take it up with the Qatari authorities . It must be noted that India and Qatar in 2015 signed an agreement on the transfer of sentenced prisoners during the Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani trip to the South Asian country . Under the agreement on extradition of convicts , Indian nationals sentenced in Qatar can be sent to their home country to serve the remaining part of their jail term . It remains to be seen whether New Delhi would invoke these provisions to seek the extradition of those eight individuals and whether Qatar would agree to it . Secondly , India can also escalate the matter to the International Court of Justice if it feels that due process is not being followed . Qatar has not yet revealed details of charges against the men , stirring concerns about the lack of transparency . For now , New Delhi might push for an appeal against the ruling within the Qatari judicial regime and seek immediate relief . A lot will depend on how the Qatari government responds to India requests for cooperation on this sensitive issue . Economic pressure India is one of the largest buyers of liquefied natural gas , and Qatar is hoping to secure a new long term LNG contract with India .

Israel is a significant trading partner in the Indian diamond sector and is important to the world diamond trade . India exported USD million worth of diamonds to Israel during 2022 23 . Israel , a major trading hub , exports raw diamonds worth USD million . The Gujarat Diamond Workers Association says 30 workers committed suicide in the city in about five months due to economic hardships and unemployment due to the downturn in the industry . The association pointed out that the diamond traders have stopped importing rough diamonds for the next two months , which will trigger a further rise in unemployment . Ramesh Jilaria , president of the Gujarat Diamond Workers Association , said , First it was the Ukraine war that affected the diamond industry . The Israel Palestine conflict has delivered a double blow , resulting in job losses to artisans across Gujarat . Each year , as Diwali approaches , diamond manufacturing units are usually open for 24 hours , but this time diamond workers are getting work for up to 10 hours . Many factories have begun offering a two day off per week . Due to a scarcity of diamonds and raw material , many small units in Surat have declared an early Diwali vacation , Jilaria said . Bhavesh Tank , vice president of the Gujarat Diamond Workers Association , said , In Surat , there are approximately 8 lakh artisans working in the diamond industry , on which approximately at least 4 lakh families depend . If the war continues , thousands of people will lose their jobs in the next few days . We have demanded an assistance package from the state government .

              " 'Will Respond Decisively If : US Issues Stern Warning To Iran Amid Israel Hamas War New York : In a strongly worded message , US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has delivered a significant warning to Iran , vowing that the United States would respond with unwavering determination if Iran or its proxies were to attack American personnel . This comes as the Joe Biden administration works to prevent Iran from becoming involved in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas . Blinken addressed the United Nations Security Council , making it clear that the United States aims to avoid conflict with Iran and does not desire an escalation of the conflict . However , he emphasized that any attack by Iran or its proxies on US personnel would prompt an immediate and decisive response . He also called upon other nations , including Russia and China , who are part of the 15 member Security Council , to dissuade Iran from opening a new front against Israel or attacking its allies . Furthermore , he stressed the need to hold Iran accountable should such actions occur . Hamas Vs LeT In his address , Blinken drew a parallel between the actions of Hamas in Israel and the Pakistan based terror organization Lashkar e Taiba . He underscored that all acts of terrorism , whether targeting people in different parts of the world , are \" unlawful and unjustifiable . \" The Secretary of State stressed the Security Council duty to condemn nations providing support to terrorist groups in the form of arming , funding , or training . This appeal was notably referencing the Mumbai terror attacks carried out by Lashkar e Taiba , resulting in the loss of 166 lives , including six Americans . Humanitarian Pauses In Gaza War Blinken also called for \" humanitarian pauses \" in the Gaza conflict to protect Palestinian civilians . This falls short of a ceasefire , which the US has refrained from endorsing , in order to ensure Israel right to respond to the October 7 attack on Hamas . He criticized the international community for failing to explicitly condemn the October 7 Hamas attack , highlighting the importance of world leaders acknowledging the right and responsibility to respond to terror attacks against their citizens . Israel Call For UN Chief Resignation In a separate development , Israel has demanded the resignation of United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres following his comments regarding the Israeli counteroffensive in Gaza . The Israeli envoy to the UN , Gilad Erdan , deemed Guterres \" unfit \" to lead the UN and called for his resignation . This demand came after Guterres stated that the attacks by Hamas could not justify the \" collective punishment of the Palestinian people , \" citing the decades of occupation , settlement expansion , and violence endured by the Palestinian population . Humanitarian Crisis In Gaza The Ministry of Health in Gaza reported a dire situation , with over Palestinians killed , including a significant number of children , women , journalists , medical workers , and first responders . Additionally , over people have been injured , highlighting the severity of the humanitarian crisis in the region .',\n",

              " 'Sponge bombs are Israel new secret weapon to block Hamas tunnels Israel will use novel sponge bombs as it fights through the network of Hamas tunnels under Gaza . The Israel Defense Forces IDF has been testing the chemical bombs , which contain no explosives but are used to seal off gaps or tunnel entrances from which fighters may emerge . The IDF has not commented on the use of the so called sponge bombs , which create a sudden explosion of foam that rapidly expands and then hardens . Its soldiers were seen deploying the devices during exercises in 2021 . The army has set up a mock tunnel system at the army base near the border with Gaza . Troops are likely to face a bloody battle through the tunnels known as the Gaza Metro when they launch their expected ground invasion . The network is thought to be hundreds of miles long and dense with traps . It is where Hamas has taken many of the 200 hostages and where its leaders will hope to survive the coming war . Israeli soldiers blinded mishandling new bomb The sponge bomb would prevent soldiers being ambushed as they move further into the network , sealing off gaps through which Hamas could attack . Contained in a plastic container , the specialist devices have a metal partition separating two liquids . Once this barrier is extracted , the compounds mix as the soldier positions the bomb or throws it further ahead . Specialised teams in the IDF engineering corps have been grouped into tunnel reconnaissance units and equipped with ground and aerial sensors , ground penetrating radar and special drilling systems to locate tunnels . They have also been issued with special equipment to see when underground . Standard issue night vision goggles need an element of ambient light to work effectively , but with all natural light blocked out when moving underground , troops will rely on thermal technology to see in the total darkness . Novel radios , optimised for working in the extreme conditions experienced underground , have also been developed . There are potential complications with the underground arsenal , however . The sponge bomb technically a liquid emulsion is hazardous to work with , and some Israeli soldiers have lost their sight through mishandling the mixture . Israel may also use robots and drones to help when navigating the tunnels but so far , there have been difficulties operating these underground . Some of the robots will be controlled by wires spooling out of the rear of the device . Others will rely on standard radio waves , but will need a series of repeater nodes to be dropped off en route as radio signals degrade quickly underground . Micro drones for reconnaissance , capable of being held in the palm of a hand , may also be used but will similarly suffer as the radio signal weakens . The Israel based Roboteam technology company has developed IRIS , a small , throwable drone that can be driven on large wheels via remote control .',\n",

However , ongoing conflicts in the region have raised concerns about the future of this project , at least in the short term , according to industry experts . Almost all the proposed routes for the corridor pass through the conflict zone before reaching the port of Haifa . The IMEC project was seen as a breakthrough in the relationship between the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Israel , two countries without any diplomatic relations . Lately , both nations have shown signs of softening their stance , with Saudi Arabia recently permitting Israeli airlines to use its airspace . Media reports indicate that a 27 billion rail link between the northern city of Kiryat Shmona and the Red Sea resort of Eilat in the far south is expected to play a crucial role in the project . \" A section of the project , up to the port of Haifa , will traverse this region .

But the blanket nature of the embargo , which is in place ahead of a widely expected military offensive by Israel , has been heavily criticized , and a small number of aid lorries have been allowed access via the Rafah Crossing between Egypt and Gaza . French channel BFMTV reported the ship Macron said on Wednesday would leave the port city of Toulon within 48 hours is a helicopter carrier called the Tonnerre . France , Macron continued , would be \" fully involved in securing access to medicines and care \" for people in Gaza . He made the comments in the Egyptian capital Cairo , on the second day of a trip in which he has also visited Israel , the West Bank , and Jordan . Egypt and Jordan were the first two Arab states to establish diplomatic relations with Israel , so have been strategically important mediators in times of high regional tensions . \" International law applies to everyone and France carries the universal values of humanism , \" Macron explained , while also saying a plane load of medical supplies would be sent to Egypt , to be forwarded to Gaza . \" All human lives are equal and all victims deserve our sympathy and our permanent commitment to promote a just and lasting peace in the Middle East , \" he added .

She expressed concern for people who are unable to evacuate due to various reasons , emphasising that advance warnings may not be effective in such situations . Hastings noted that when evacuation routes are targeted , people on both sides of the conflict are affected , and essential resources for survival become scarce . She stressed the importance of adhering to international law , which requires the protection of civilians and their access to essential needs , regardless of their choice to move or stay . She also called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages . Possible indications of a ground invasion The recent actions by the Israeli military , including the \" targeted raid \" and airstrikes , suggest a potential build up to a ground invasion in Gaza . While the images show tanks and armored bulldozers , there is no direct visual evidence of ground combat . The Israeli army language in its statement is notably stronger than in previous operations , indicating that this incursion is part of preparations for what they term \" the next stages of combat . \" This messaging is intended to maintain a sense of imminent ground incursion for several reasons : To boost morale among Israeli forces on the ground . For domestic consumption , demonstrating a forthcoming response . To exert pressure on Hamas , particularly regarding ongoing hostage negotiations . It worth noting that this is not the first time the IDF has confirmed an incursion into Gaza since the recent escalation of hostilities , with previous raids and troop movements occurring since October 7 .

              " 'Will Iran Seek to Leverage Its Nuclear Program as Middle East Tensions Soar ? Recent efforts to de escalate tensions between the West and Iran over Tehran nuclear program have been set back by the recent Hamas terror attack on Israel , and Iran could seek to use the atomic program as leverage , according to analysts . Western powers accuse Iran of supporting Hamas as a proxy militant group in the region , although they have not accused Tehran of direct involvement in the group October 7 cross border terror attack on Israel , which killed more than Israeli soldiers and civilians . Hamas is also holding more than 200 people hostage . Israel subsequent bombing of Hamas targets in Gaza had killed almost people as of Wednesday , according to Palestinian health officials , including more than children . Prior to the Hamas attack , relations between the West and Iran appeared to be cautiously improving . In September , the United States agreed on a prisoner swap with Tehran , brokered by Qatar . Five prisoners were exchanged on each side and Washington agreed to release 6 billion of frozen Iranian assets . The refroze that money following the attack by Hamas , which Washington has designated as a terrorist group . It was widely expected that after the detainee deal between Iran and the United States and the de escalatory understanding that the two countries had , which had brought about a much calmer context that there was room for direct negotiations towards the end of October between Iran and the , in Oman , said Ali Vaez , Iran Project director at the International Crisis Group in Washington . But that , I think , is now completely off the books , and there is probably no political space left for direct engagement between the two countries . \" Whether there is engagement or not , Vaez continued , the Iranian nuclear issue remains a major crisis , and I think the last thing that the Biden administration needs in the coming year , as it deals with the war between Israel and Hamas and the war in Ukraine , is a nuclear crisis in the Middle East . Future engagement President Joe Biden is unlikely to seek further engagement with Iran on the nuclear program , according to Peter Jenkins , a former British ambassador to the nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , or IAEA . If Iran gets blamed , at least in part , for those Hamas attacks because those militias are considered to be Iran backed , then I find it very hard to imagine that the Biden administration would want to expose itself to attack from the public or especially from Republicans in Congress and from Israel , or from Israeli lobbies like AIPAC , by opening negotiations with Iran , Jenkins told VOA . AIPAC is the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , a bipartisan , pro Israel political action committee and lobbying group . Iran is also unlikely to seek further talks , he added . The current Iranian administration is not an enthusiast for the JCPOA . And what just happened is that the United States has refrozen 6 billion belonging to Iran , but long frozen which the Biden administration had promised , pledged to unfreeze in return for the release of hostages . I assume that in Tehran people are feeling rather incensed about that , Jenkins told VOA . He was referring to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal , known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action . The West should not treat the Iranian nuclear threat in isolation from other concerns such as Tehran support for militant proxies like Hamas , argued Behnam Ben Taleblu , an analyst with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington . \" For me , the concern is a larger picture of both sides of the Atlantic disconnecting the dots between the patron Iran and proxy problem and between the politics of the major Iran issue of the day : the JCPOA , the general issue of sanctions relief , and the more localized nature of the conflict . I think this disconnecting the dots is unhelpful to seeing the bigger picture as it quite literally now unfolding in Gaza and in Israel , Taleblu told VOA . JCPOA talks Talks in Vienna to revive the nuclear deal stalled last year , although neither side has said the negotiations are officially finished . Then President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA in 2018 , saying it had failed to halt Iran enrichment activities or curb its missile program and support for militant proxies in the region . Tehran stopped complying with its commitments under the JCPOA soon afterward and removed the IAEA monitoring equipment in June 2022 while blocking some nuclear inspectors from visiting the country . The IAEA said in its latest report published in August that Iran was continuing to enrich uranium up to 60 percent purity , short of 90 percent weapons grade fuel . Iran decision to remove all of the agency equipment previously installed in Iran for JCPOA related surveillance and monitoring activities has also had detrimental implications for the agency ability to provide assurance of the peaceful nature of Iran nuclear program , the IAEA report said . Nuclear fuel enrichment Following the prisoner swap in September , Iran tentatively agreed to halt the stockpiling of some enriched uranium , Vaez said . As part of the de escalatory understanding between Iran and the , Iran stopped accumulating additional 60 enriched uranium . Well , that might now change , given the rising tensions between the two sides , he said . Further enrichment of uranium from 60 to 90 percent purity could take place in a matter of days . It would take Iran less than a week to enrich enough uranium for a single nuclear weapon . That is down from more than 12 months when President Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal . And that why this is literally a ticking bomb and there needs to be a solution one way or another to curb Iran nuclear activities , Vaez told VOA . No correlation IAEA chief Rafael Grossi recently told CNBC that he saw no correlation between the Israel Hamas war and Iran nuclear program . I do see a correlation between these two things , Grossi said in an October 20 interview . If you look at the bigger picture in terms of security and the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians , we have seen moments of increased tension , and this has not resulted in a direct change or shift when it comes to what happens in Iran . Jenkins , the former British ambassador to the IAEA , said there were no signs yet that Iran is seeking a nuclear bomb . There is still no evidence from the IAEA , whose inspectors continue to visit Iranian plants at very frequent intervals , or from the American intelligence community , which tends to make public its assessments there still no evidence that Iran is contemplating a move away from compliance with its essential Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty commitment , which is to refrain from manufacturing nuclear weapons , he said . Leverage Tehran could seek to use its nuclear program as leverage against the West , as tensions increase in the region . I can imagine them looking for ways of increasing concern and anxiety in the West about their nuclear program , but stopping short of actually , shall we say , crossing the line and ceasing to be in compliance with the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty . That is , after all , the game they been playing for the last five years . Bit by bit , they been increasing the level at which they are enriching uranium , Jenkins told VOA . Meanwhile , Israel has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon . Israel itself is widely believed to have atomic weapons , although it does not allow IAEA inspections of its nuclear sites and is not a signatory to the accord .',\n",
              " 'US strikes Syria sites used by Iran , its proxies after attacks on American troops The United States has carried out strikes on two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups in response to a recent series of attacks against American personnel based in Iraq and Syria by Tehran backed militias , US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday . US bases and personnel in the Middle East have been targeted in a slew of drone and missile attacks since October 17 . In assaults that used drones to target al Asad Airbase in Iraq and al Tanf Garrison in Syria , an American contractor for the US military died from a cardiac arrest while sheltering during one of the strikes and 21 US soldiers were lightly injured before returning to duty shortly thereafter , the Pentagon said . US President Joe Biden directed today action to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself , its personnel , and its interests , Austin said in a statement . Austin stressed that the US does not seek conflict and has no intention nor desire to engage in further hostilities , but these Iranian backed attacks against US forces are unacceptable and must stop . Get The Times of Israel Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up , you agree to the terms Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces . We will not let them . If attacks by Iran proxies against US forces continue , we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people , the US defense chief said . These narrowly tailored strikes in self defense were intended solely to protect and defend US personnel in Iraq and Syria . They are separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas , and do not constitute a shift in our approach to the Israel Hamas conflict , Austin clarified We continue to urge all state and non state entities not to take action that would escalate into a broader regional conflict , he said . Advertisement According to the Pentagon , there have now been at least 19 attacks on US bases and personnel in Iraq and Syria since 17 , including three on Thursday . A senior US military official said the precision strikes hit weapons and ammunition storage areas that were connected to the IRGC , which is a US designated terrorist organization . Two US fighter jets carried out the sortie on sites near the town of Boukamal near the Iraqi border , the official said . The area is thought to be a main conduit for weapons transfers between Iran and Syria or Lebanon , via Iraq . The official said there had been Iranian aligned militia and IRGC personnel on the base and no civilians , but the US does not have any information yet on casualties or an assessment of damage . The official would not say how many munitions were launched by the . Advertisement A senior defense official said the sites were chosen because the IRGC stores the types of munitions that were used in the strikes against US bases and troops . The official told reporters that the airstrikes will have a significant impact on the ability of Iranian proxy groups to continue to attack US forces . Asked which groups were targeted , the official said there are several that may have different names , but the US holds Tehran responsible for funding , arming , equipping and directing the proxies . The official said the airstrikes were not designed to expand the conflict in the region but to compel Iran to direct the militia groups to cease the attacks on American bases and personnel . The two officials briefed reporters after the strikes on condition of anonymity providing details on the mission that had not yet been made public . The strikes in Syria followed a direct warning Thursday from US President Joe Biden to Iran supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei against attacks on US troops , the White House said . There was a direct message relayed . That as far as I going to go , US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters , declining to say how it was delivered . Israel has repeatedly accused Iran of being a key force behind the coordinated Hamas attack on Israel , in which terrorists streamed across the border to carry out a devastating assault on nearby communities , killing some people , and taking over 220 people hostage . The vast majority of those killed as gunmen seized border communities were civilians including babies , children and the elderly . Entire families were executed in their homes , and over 260 were slaughtered at an outdoor festival , many amid horrific acts of brutality by the terrorists . Advertisement However , the Biden administration has not publicly accused Iran of having a direct role in the devastating 7 attack and has said it appears so far that Tehran was not aware of it beforehand . The US has noted that Iran has long supported Hamas and has raised concerns that Iran and its proxies could turn the conflict into a wider war . US officials have routinely stressed that the American response is designed to be proportional , and is aimed at deterring strikes against US personnel who are focused on the fight against the Islamic State group . While US officials have not publicly tied the recent string of attacks in Syria and Iraq to the Israel Hamas war , Iranian officials have openly criticized the US for providing weapons to Israel that have been used to strike Gaza . The Pentagon , meanwhile , has also beefed up air defenses in the region to protect US forces . Israel has reportedly agreed to delay its Gaza ground operation until the systems are in place . The US has said it is sending several batteries of Patriot missile systems , a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense THAAD battery and additional fighter jets . The THAAD is being sent from Fort Bliss , Texas , and the Patriot batteries are from Fort Liberty in North Carolina and Fort Sill in Oklahoma . An Avenger air defense system from Fort Liberty is also being sent . Advertisement Officials have said as many as two battalions of Patriots are being deployed . A battalion can include at least three Patriot batteries , which each have six to eight launchers . US troops have also deployed or are in the process of going to the Middle East region , including those associated with the air defense systems . The United States has already deployed two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean in a powerful show of support for Israel .',\n",

Infantry and engineering units struck targets overnight near the neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City under cover of air force helicopters , drones and jets , the Israel Defence Forces IDF said on Friday . It followed a substantial but limited raid into a northern part of the coastal strip the previous night in an effort to scout Hamas positions and tunnel networks . Israeli footage shows tanks carrying out targeted raid in Gaza video Fresh bombardments before dawn killed dozens , including children and a journalist , Yasser Abu Namous , the Palestinian Authority run news agency Wafa reported . Aid workers are preparing to send eight trucks with food , medicine and water into the territory . Philippe Lazzarini , the commissioner general for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees , said sporadic , limited deliveries were just crumbs when measured against the humanitarian needs of million people . The current system in place is geared to fail , he told a press conference in Jerusalem . What is needed is meaningful and uninterrupted aid flow . And to succeed , we need a humanitarian ceasefire to ensure this aid reaches those in need . Lazzarini said 57 of the agency staff had been killed in the conflict . He issued a tacit rebuke to sceptics of casualty figures from the Hamas run health ministry , which says more than people have died in Gaza since 7 October . The commissioner said its figures in previous conflicts had been considered credible . Satellite images provided by Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs show how the bombardment has reduced towns and cities to rubble , with rows of residential buildings erased . Leaders of the 27 EU member states have unanimously called for humanitarian corridors and pauses of the bombing to allow food , water and medical supplies to enter the territory . More than 250 British lawyers , including professors of law , urged the UK government to press for a ceasefire , saying serious breaches of international law were being committed . Fears of the crisis spreading across the region deepened on Friday after US warplanes bombed two locations in eastern Syria linked to Iran Revolutionary Guards . The strikes hit weapons storage facilities and were a response to drone and missile attacks by Iranian backed groups against US bases and personnel in Syria and Iraq , the Pentagon said . In the occupied West Bank , Israeli forces killed four Palestinians in the latest in a series of raids that have killed scores and injured hundreds . Israeli officials said one of the four killed was Ayser Mohammad Al Amer , a Palestinian Islamic Jihad field commander . Israeli military officials raised the number of people held hostage in Gaza to 233 , five more than the 228 cited a day earlier . Relatives of some hostages protested in Tel Aviv on Thursday against what they said was government inaction to free the hostages . They been there for 20 days , said Meirav Leshem Gonen , whose 23 year old daughter Romi was abducted , the Times of Israel reported . Twenty days in which we had no idea how they doing , how they being treated , if they OK , if they breathing . According to the Russian newspaper Kommersant , a member of a Hamas delegation in Moscow , Abu Hamid , said Hamas could not release hostages until a ceasefire was agreed . Concern about the fate of the hostages has appeared to soften Israeli public support for a ground invasion of Gaza . Almost half of Israelis 49 wish to hold off , according to a poll by the newspaper . It found that 29 of Israelis backed an immediate invasion , with 22 undecided . In a poll on 10 October three days after the conflict began when Hamas militants entered southern Israel and killed more than people 65 backed a major ground offensive . Israel defence minister , Yoav Gallant , said on Thursday night a full ground incursion would be launched soon . We are responding with fire and creating the conditions for the ongoing war . There will also be other stages , he told Kan radio . We are preparing them , and we will carry them out . I am determined to deliver victory .',\n",

              " 'The Hamas Threat of Hostage Execution Videos Looms Large Over Social Media One of the key ways that tech companies try to keep violent extremist content from going viral on their platforms is by using what are known as hashing databases . When content from a terrorist organization is identified , it is hashed to create a unique identifier that can then be shared among all companies to automatically prevent that video or image from being reshared elsewhere . The sharing of these hashes and communication around incidents like the Israel Hamas war are coordinated by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism GIFCT , a small team of experts whose mission is to stop tech platforms from being exploited by violent extremists . The group was founded in 2017 by Facebook , Microsoft , X then Twitter , and YouTube as a way of centralizing and coordinating the sharing of information . Companies like Dropbox , Amazon , Pinterest , and Zoom also provide funding to the group . GIFCT did not provide a spokesperson to answer WIRED questions , but a statement on the group website says it is providing regular situational awareness across member companies and support in addressing content relating to this conflict that violates their platform policies . Even when mainstream platforms have access to a shared database of verified terrorist content and centralized communications with experts who are tracking this content closely , they still have a lot of work to do in order to prevent violent videos from spreading on their platforms . This will be a big litmus test for the mainstream platforms , Hadley says . We would expect their algorithmic systems to be able to detect the Hamas logo , for instance , and respond accordingly . So actually , we quietly confident that those platforms will be alright to handle it . And I would hope that they been training their algorithms in anticipation of this , based on the very large amounts of existing content from Hamas and PIJ . But unfortunately , we have no insight into that at all . Updated at am ET , October 27 , 2023 , to add that Reddit does not offer livestreaming and has also banned Hamas .',\n",
              " 'Malaysia royal houses elect Sultan Ibrahim as new king In meeting with Biden , new Speaker Mike Johnson says GOP wo abandon Ukraine but will aid Israel first WASHINGTON : President Joe Biden met with new House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Thursday to discuss his request for nearly 106 billion for Israel , Ukraine and other national security needs . Johnson , a staunch conservative allied with Donald Trump , has shown little interest in providing additional money from Congress to support Ukraine in its war against Russia . Later , the new Republican speaker insisted Congress is not going to abandon Ukraine . Instead , Johnson said House Republicans would first bring a separate bill to provide billion in aid to Israel , but they need more information about the Biden administration Ukraine strategy . We ca allow Vladimir Putin to prevail in Ukraine because I do believe it would stop there , Johnson said on Fox News Hannity , referring to the Russian president . But he said , We must stand with our important ally in the Middle East and that Israel . The new Republican leader who swept into office nearly a month after the ouster of Kevin McCarthy as speaker had a busy first full day in office , having inherited many of the same political problems that tormented past GOP leaders and challenged their tenure as speaker . In the morning , Johnson said prayer is appropriate as a response to the mass shootings in Maine . Johnson , an evangelical Christian from Louisiana , declined to take questions , including about the possibility of any gun violence legislation from Congress . Prayer is appropriate at a time like this , that the evil can end and the senseless violence can stop , he said . The House convened with a bustle of activity , making up for lost time during the weeks of chaos since McCarthy ouster as speaker . But the initial goodwill toward Johnson blurs the political fault lines challenging his ability to lead the GOP majority in the face of daunting issues ahead . By 17 , the Congress must fund the government again or risk a federal shutdown . Biden wants nearly 106 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Israel and Ukraine . And Republicans are eager to resume their impeachment inquiry into Biden over his son Hunter business dealings . Enough of the chaos , enough of the dysfunction , said Jeffries , D , adding it was time for Congress to get back to business . Jeffries said Democrats were heartbroken over the latest shootings and stand with the people of Maine in every way possible , including discussing how Congress can address gun violence . Johnson said he and Biden met together for more than 15 minutes before the other party arrived . It was a productive meeting , Johnson told reporters back at the Capitol . I enjoyed my visit with the president . Biden met with Johnson and Jeffries before the House leaders joined a classified briefing with other congressional lawmakers on the assistance package , according to a White House official . The briefing in the Situation Room for Johnson and other House leaders on the emergency funding request was the first time the new speaker , who opposes the aid to Ukraine , was getting a close airing from White House officials about Biden case for the money . The White House has conducted similar briefings in recent weeks . Biden had called Johnson to congratulate him after his election Wednesday and said it was time for all of us to act responsibly to fund the government and provide that foreign aid . We need to move swiftly , the president said in a statement . Johnson , 51 , swept through on the first ballot with support from all Republicans anxious to put weeks of tumult behind and get on with the business of governing . He was quickly sworn as speaker and is now second in line to the presidency , after the vice president . While not the Republicans top choice , Johnson had few foes and an important backer in Donald Trump . At the Capitol on Thursday , Johnson sat down with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese , who told reporters afterward that he had a very good meeting with the new speaker . Johnson met later with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell , who said on social media they had a great meeting . He has also heard from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , D , who told the new speaker in a Wednesday call that a bipartisan agreement with Democrats is the only way to avoid a shutdown . In winning the gavel , Johnson , who has been in the House for less than a decade , drew together fellow Republicans through his faith , conservative roots and Trump nod after more seasoned leaders had failed . I a Bible believing Christian , Johnson told Fox Sean Hannity . The speaker said when he asked his views on the issues , he advises : Well , go pick up a Bible off your shelf and read it , that my worldview . That what I believe . Democrats said Johnson , a lawyer specializing in constitutional issues , was an extreme conservative , a strict opponent of abortion access and an architect of Trump legal effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election he lost to Democrat Biden . After Johnson election , lawmakers approved a resolution Wednesday saying the House stands with Israel and condemns Hamas brutal war . They next turned to a stalled government funding bill . Rather than take a scheduled work period at home , Republicans rearranged the House calendar to return to Washington next week and keep pushing through the various government funding bills before the 17 deadline . In a letter to colleagues , Johnson outlined priorities that include providing a short term funding bill , into next year , to prevent a November shutdown almost the same move that led to McCarthy ouster . Speaker Johnson has been very clear that we got to secure America border , we want to support Israel , said Majority Leader Steve Scalize , who conferred with Johnson ahead of the White House meeting . But all of the other items that the President is talking about run secondary . Republican Michael McCaul of Texas , the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , said Johnson is thoughtful and smart , and understands that aid for Ukraine is a national security issue , despite opposition from other Republicans in their majority . And what I saw in the Situation Room was I thought he was very open to the idea , said McCaul . To avoid a shutdown , Johnson will need to balance far right demands with the realities of keeping the government functioning . Most Republicans voted against the budget deal McCarthy , R , struck with Biden earlier this year , demanding steeper spending cuts . Similar Republican infighting has chased three other GOP speakers to early departures . The difference now is that Republican rules allow any single lawmaker to force a vote to remove the speaker from office .',\n",

              " 'Israel Hamas war : Satellite data shows Israel intensifying bombing of south Gaza For three weeks , Israel has been bombing the Gaza Strip as part of its war with Hamas . The two sides have published conflicting accounts of the toll taken by the airstrikes . Satellite data gives us an independent view . Every 12 days , NASA satellite passes three times over the Gaza Strip , firing out radar waves and listening for their echo . Buildings typically bounce the signals right back , but rubble scatters them in all directions . By comparing signals before the war with those taken more recently , we can estimate the scope and scale of the destruction . This map shows what Gaza looked like before the war , its population densely clustered in Gaza City , in the far north , and the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis . Image : Map of buildings in the Gaza Strip , with major cities highlighted . SOURCE : Open Street Map By 13 October , six days after Hamas launched its attacks in southern Israel , much of Gaza City had been hit by airstrikes . The satellite data suggests 15 of buildings in northern Gaza were damaged or destroyed in less than a week , along with 2 in southern Gaza . That same day , Israel ordered all million residents of northern Gaza to flee southwards to relative safety . Since then , however , Israel has stepped up its bombing of the south . The map below shows the estimated damage to buildings across Gaza on 13 and 25 October , with the most damaged areas highlighted in yellow . Almost half of all new damage detected between 14 and 25 October was in southern Gaza 47 , up from 14 before the evacuation order . While there was a decrease in new damage across the Gaza Strip during those two weeks , the level of destruction in southern Gaza increased by 85 . A spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces declined to comment . Many of those who fled the north after 13 October have ended up in the Gaza Strip second most populous city , Khan Younis . Since then , satellite data shows neighbourhoods across the city have sustained damage . The video below , uploaded to Snapchat on 24 October , shows smoke rising from behind a school in Khan Younis . Sky News has verified the location of the footage , and satellite analysis shows that a row of buildings immediately behind the school sustained damage between 14 and 25 October . The Gaza Strip has been under aerial bombardment since Hamas 7 October attack , in which the Israeli government says more than were killed . Israel says that Hamas is still holding more than 200 people hostage inside the enclave . Five British citizens remain missing . The airstrikes come as Israel prepares to launch an anticipated ground invasion of the Gaza Strip . According to Gaza health ministry , which is controlled by Hamas , more than people have been killed in the airstrikes two thirds of them women and children . Sky satellite data suggests that one in four buildings in northern Gaza 25 have been damaged or destroyed in the past three weeks , along with 8 of those in the south .

              " 'British roots of conflict in Palestine There are simply too many instances of these conflicts being traced back to the British Empire to imagine a coincidence Follow us on our Malay and English WhatsApp , Telegram , Instagram , Tiktok and Youtube channels . By Saurav Sarkar Israeli flags were flying over all government buildings in the UK recently , but this is the first time the former imperial hegemon has put its weight behind Zionism . In 1917 the British government issued the infamous Balfour Declaration . This brief document 67 words was a turning point in modern Palestinian history . It committed Great Britain to establishing a national home for Jewish people in Palestine . The initial language promised a Jewish state , but was changed later . The Balfour Declaration contained language that was meant to safeguard Palestinians , but we have seen how that has played out in the ensuing century . From World War One to 1948 , the British ruled Palestine , the bulk of that time under a mandate issued by the League of Nations . The population of Jewish settlers in Palestine increased over these decades the as the British government fostered their immigration . In 1922 only 11 of the population in the region was Jewish . By 1931 the figure was up to about 17 . By 1939 it was almost 30 . At that point , the British government sought to limit any further expansion of the Jewish population in order to ensure stability in the region . But by then , it was too late the facts on the ground had changed . What had been a region that was almost 90 Palestinian had become a contested land between two demographically numerous groups . Moreover , the British had confiscated land from Palestinians to hand it over to Jewish people and engaged in violent repression of incipient Palestinian nationalism . And in the , a British government commission recommended that Palestine be partitioned , laying the groundwork for the failed two state solution . In other words , this conflict is the product of specific imperial policies that were practised in the first half of the Century to foster a colonial project . The Jewish question Europe longstanding inability to adequately address its own anti Semitism was made into Palestinians Zionist problem by the British Empire . One of the key features of British rule was to play different groups against each other . One of the key methods adopted by them over the course of centuries and a global collection of provinces was to study the social history of their subjects to manage the politics and play different groups against each other . The support for Jewish migration to Palestine triggered resentment and mobilisation by indigenous Palestinians , eventually leading to the Great Revolt of 1936 1939 . The revolt , which included a general strike and peasant uprising , was violently repressed by the British government in collaboration with Zionist paramilitaries . However , after the revolt , the British began to limit further Jewish immigration to the region , turning against the group they had supported in order to protect their imperial interests . This led to violent attacks by Zionists in Palestine . Palestine is not alone in this fate . In region after region , the British used strategies of divide and rule to pit one people against another for the benefit of the empire . In British India , they pushed the Hindu Muslim divide , sometimes favouring one population , sometimes the other . In Cyprus , they pitted the Greeks against the Turks . In Sri Lanka , it was the Tamils against the Sinhalese . In Ireland , it was the Catholics against the Protestants . The list goes on . In all of these places , the supposedly ancient politics of inter group conflict have persisted beyond when the sun set on the British Empire . There have been territorial divides based on ethnicity religion . British India became India and Pakistan . Pakistan was then further subdivided into Pakistan and Bangladesh . Ireland was split up into the Republic of Ireland and the UK Northern Ireland . Cyprus is divided in two , and its legal status is still unresolved . In Sinhalese dominated Sri Lanka , a 30 year civil war , waged to establish a Tamil state , ended in 2009 in a similar fashion to what we are witnessing in Gaza today . And in 1948 , Palestine was formally partitioned , establishing a Zionist state and what was meant to be a Palestinian one , with the blessing of the former British rulers who oversaw the beginning of the Nakba . Each of these places has been marked with violent conflict based on ancient hatreds that can be traced to the last one or two centuries . It is this commonality that firmly establishes that the British Empire policies are the root cause of the violence in these regions ; there are simply too many instances of these conflicts being traced back to the empire to imagine a coincidence . While the proximate causes of Israeli apartheid , occupation and genocide clearly lie squarely at the feet of Israel and its chief sponsor , the US , the UK has a special responsibility to make right its historical sins in Palestine and everywhere else . A minimal first step would be to work to stop the current genocide instead of waving an Israeli flag . But this let alone reparations does not seem to be on the table .

              " 'Sudan rival generals to resume US and Saudi led talks on ending war By AFP More by this Author The Sudanese army and paramilitaries at war with each other for six months said Wednesday they had accepted an invitation to resume and Saudi brokered negotiations . Since April , the war between forces loyal to army chief Abdel Fattah al Burhan and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo , who commands the Rapid Support Forces , has killed more than people and displaced over million . Previous mediation attempts have only yielded brief truces , and even those were systematically violated . In a statement , the army said it had accepted an invitation from Saudi Arabia and the United States to travel to the Saudi city of Jeddah \" out of a belief by the armed forces that negotiations is one of the means that may end the conflict \" . The RSF later said their delegation \" arrived in Jeddah today \" , in hopes of \" reaching a solution that will stop the war and end the suffering of our people . \" But the army also said that \" the resumption of negotiations does not mean a halt of the national battle of dignity , for the defeat of the rebel militia , \" in reference to the RSF , which said \" our brave forces maintain full control on the battlefield \" . Advertisement Read : Sudan protagonists send mixed signals as fighting continues Before the first round of the Jeddah talks were suspended , mediators had grown increasingly frustrated with both sides reluctance to work towards a sustained truce . Experts believed that Burhan and Daglo had opted for a war of attrition instead , hoping to extract greater concessions at the negotiating table later . US officials said the talks would resume Thursday and aim for a ceasefire but that it was premature to discuss a lasting political solution . \" The new round will focus on ensuring unhindered humanitarian access and achieving ceasefires and other confidence building measures , \" a State Department official said on condition of anonymity . Another official told reporters that the United States hoped for a \" constructive spirit \" in the talks , saying , \" there is no acceptable military solution to this conflict . \" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken , who helped mediate at the start of the crisis , finalised details on the talks on a recent visit to Saudi Arabia as part of a trip largely devoted to the Israel Hamas war , US officials said . Also participating in the Jeddah talks will be representatives of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development IGAD , the East African regional bloc led by close US partner Kenya . The war in Sudan has decimated already fragile infrastructure , shuttered 80 percent of the country hospitals and plunged millions into acute hunger . Read : Sudan health crisis worsens amid violence \" For six months , civilians particularly in Khartoum , Darfur and Kordofan have known no respite from bloodshed and terror , \" said UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths . In the western region of Darfur , ethnically motivated attacks by the RSF and allied militias have triggered a new investigation by the International Criminal Court into possible war crimes . According to the United Nations , Sudan where many had fled their homes in previous conflicts is now the largest internal displacement crisis in the world , with over million people displaced within the country . The UN Griffiths said that six months into the conflict , \" basic services are crumbling \" , disease outbreaks are \" stalking the country \" and \" aid workers continue to be stymied in reaching people in need \" . A projection by the US Johns Hopkins University indicated that \" at least children under five years of age may die by the end of 2023 \" . Two years ago , Burhan and Daglo led a coup on October 25 , 2021 that derailed a fragile transition to civilian rule . They later fell out in a power struggle that erupted into all out war on April 15 . The United States has called for a return to the democratic path but has not brought in civilians to participate in the Jeddah talks . \" They need more time to prepare , organise themselves internally , \" another US official said .',\n",

              " 'India turn to learn from Israel how to combat disinformation warfare In an era dominated by rapid technological advancements and global interconnectedness , the nature of warfare has evolved . While traditional military conflicts still exist , a new form of warfare has emerged in recent years : disinformation warfare . This subtle , information based form of aggression leverages the power of the internet and social media to manipulate , deceive , and sow discord . On Saturday , October , incidentally , of great significance for Jews across the globe , Hamas carried out terror attacks on Israeli kibbutzim and settlements . These attacks involved a surprise infiltration by more than 1200 Hamas terrorists into Israeli territory , targeting towns , settlements , and kibbutzim near the Gaza Strip . The attacks included various methods such as storming Israeli beaches , engaging in firefights with Israeli forces , infiltrating towns , and settlements , opening fire on homes , and taking hostages . The attacks resulted in the killing and injuring of Israeli citizens , including children , women , and the elderly . The attacks caused significant devastation and loss of life in the affected areas and garnered a military retaliation by the Israeli Army . Incidentally , Oct 6 to October 25 is also the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War of 1973 . Yom Kippur is considered the holiest day in the Jewish calendar as it marks the observance of what is translated into the Day of Atonement . What has been remarkable amidst this shock , grief , outrage and mourning of the Israeli people , its citizens , its journalists and the IDF is their closing of ranks to counter the disinformation emanating from the mouthpieces of Hamas from Gaza and various media outlets across the Middle East and the West . The IDF held a Twitter Spaces event on the day , for more than three hours attended by more than listeners , clarifying the allegations of targeting refugees leaving Gaza towards the Southern border with Egypt into the Rafah crossing . The IDF spokesperson dispelled fallacies , disinformation , incorrect data and outright lies generated in the wake of the Hamas attacks and the inevitable Israeli military preparations for entering the Gaza Strip . Many Indians find themselves pondering why they are leading in the realm of disinformation warfare , given the ongoing need to counter Pakistani propaganda and address the continuous challenges posed by self serving politicians who question the motives of the Indian Army . This is particularly pertinent in the context of the recurrent scrutiny from left leaning political factions . Disinformation warfare often referred to as information warfare or hybrid warfare , involves the dissemination of false or misleading information with the intent to manipulate public opinion , undermine trust in institutions , and disrupt the social fabric of targeted nations . This tactic is executed through various channels , including state sponsored troll farms , fake news outlets , and social media platforms . While disinformation campaigns have been employed for decades , the digital age has enabled their proliferation and effectiveness on an unprecedented scale , especially after Elon Musk , the owner of X formerly Twitter opened the app for citizen journalism . The implications and objectives of disinformation campaigns are to destabilize target nations by exploiting divisions , exacerbating political , ethnic , or social tensions , and fostering public mistrust . This phenomenon is something Indian citizens are aware of by now , employed by not just the Pakistani ISI but also media houses in the West and the Middle East who employ our version of brown coolies or Indian origin analysts , experts , and academicians to sow discord and to weaken the nation narrative in order to gain fame , lucrative careers , incentives . This has been happening since our Independence struggle days the orientalist Western media tropes of the land of snake charmers and rope tricks never having really gone from the white colonial mind . Seeing the rise of India economic future , its geopolitical independence , its stabilising hold of its historical narrative and the rising awareness amongst the masses , the disinformation warfare has also reached peak levels , aiming to erode trust in our democratic institutions , tame our media , and even mock our scientific achievements as was evident during the recent Chandrayaan moon landing and our successful fight against pandemic . A population divided by conflicting narratives is less likely to make informed decisions or unite in times of crisis . Disinformation campaigns can lead to economic harm , particularly when targeting our local industries or native companies while falsely implicating them in wrongdoings . Stock prices can plummet , investments may dwindle , and businesses can suffer reputational damage . There are lessons to learn from the Israelis today . Even though they are preparing for their war of all wars , to bring peace and stability to the conflict ridden region and ensure Hamas the terrorist organisation is obliterated forever so that Israeli citizens are targeted ever again ; they are also successfully countering the propaganda emanating from Pallywood a colloquial term for the false and fake videos of brutalities and children death originating from Palestinian Territories , often accidentally leaked . Additionally , the global outrage against Israel , mostly engineered by leftists and woke groups is being countered daily by the social media app X , ensuring that community notes accompany questionable posts with false or misleading information . Citizen journalists are engaging with Hamas supporting rallies in various Western cities , videotaping their anti Semitic rants , and making sure their employers or educational institutions know about their existence , which has resulted in backlashes and got many rusticated or terminated . India is decades behind such a counter strategy but catching up fast . The cultural resurgence of India , generally labelled Hindutva , often disparagingly , is making sure that this time the nation has a hold on its narrative , its strategies , its plans , and foreign policies . But it has a long way to go as compared to the Israelis and Jewish supporting groups . The notorious allegations of an Aam Aadmi Party AAP politician Raghav Chadha regarding the funeral arrangements of a soldier , forced the ADGPI Additional Directorate General of Public Information , a department within the Indian Army to issue an official clarification on how the soldier died and that it does distinguish between soldiers deaths , which the politician had questioned . If the country resources and valuable time are used in clearing its position for malicious actors belonging to the country , when will we counter the huge network of anti India forces , charted out in Rajiv Malhotra and Vidya Vishwanathan book Snakes in the Ganga : Breaking India ? They are embedded in our domestic institutions as well as internationally , collaborating with those , particularly in Turkey and China . We have a nation to build our infrastructure is getting an upgrading and a revamping ; our educational institutions need overhauling , and our research and development are still not vibrantly active . We have just started defining our geopolitical independence and our insistence on home manufactured defence systems . We still have to mend our permanent religious fault lines a baggage of the Partition and Independence struggle days . There are scores of problems that need our attention socially , politically , economically ; that we can not afford to lag in countering disinformation in peaceful times . The Israelis , at war , are leading by example and their coordination teams , their collaboration , their precision plans , and their work ethics are something we , a parallel civilisation since ancient times , need to learn from and adopt . Addressing disinformation warfare is a multifaceted challenge that demands collaborative efforts from various stakeholders in India . Firstly , there is a critical need for public education , emphasizing media literacy to enable individuals to critically evaluate the information they encounter , fostering the ability to fact check and discern reliable sources from unreliable ones . Indians have been forcing tech companies , particularly social media platforms like X , Facebook , Instagram , and YouTube to play a pivotal role and proactively engage in combating disinformation by enforcing stringent content moderation , enhancing advertising transparency , and removing fake accounts and bots . Additionally , the Indian government has established policies and regulations to hold disinformation perpetrators accountable , such as withholding accounts of known perps and their accounts and channels in India . A delicate balance has to be struck between preserving free speech and discouraging malicious disinformation . Given the transnational nature of disinformation , forcing international cooperation by India is indispensable in setting norms and agreements for effectively countering this challenge . It is imperative that we Indians recognize the power of disinformation campaigns , work together to counter them , and safeguard our information ecosystem . As the battlefields shift from the traditional to the digital realm , the weapons used are no longer guns and tanks but false narratives and manipulated data . Confronting this new form of warfare is essential for preserving the integrity of our democratic institutions and the well being of our society as a whole .

              " 'Hardwired phones Gaza tunnels report details how Hamas cell planned attack on Israel The report added that Hamas operatives did not use computers or cell phones during this two year period , to evade detection , and neither did they indulge in a lot of discussions outside of the immediate area . Instead , they meet n person in these tunnels to plan the attack . Hamas operatives used the tunnel phones to communicate about the operation but stayed dark until it was time to activate and call on hundreds of fighters to launch the attack , which reportedly resulted in the deaths of more than Israelis , said the report . During the rampage that day , Hamas operatives also took over 200 hostages from infants to octogenarians . New Delhi : A small cell of Hamas planned the 7 October surprise attack on southern Israel for over two years and used a network of hardwired phones built within Gaza underground tunnels to communicate with each other , a report has said . These phones could not be tracked by Israeli or US intelligence , the CNN report said , citing intelligence shared by Israel with the United States . Colloquially called the Gaza metro by Israel Defence Forces IDF , this network of tunnels forms a vast web where Hamas operatives are known to store rockets and ammunition caches . They also use these tunnels to move about unnoticed , the IDF said , adding that the tunnels contain Hamas crucial command and control centres . The small cell waited until just before the attack was launched to prep a larger group of fighters above ground to carry out the specific operation , CNN quoted sources briefed on the assault . One of the sources said that though ground unit commanders and fighters were being trained for many months and kept at a state of general preparedness , they were only informed of the specific plans in the days leading up to the operation , the report added . The above ground training was observed but did not ring major alarm bells , as Israelis thought it was routine . CNN quoted another source saying that Iran helped Hamas develop their operational security tactics over the years . However , US intelligence does not believe Iran played a direct role in the planning of the 7 October attack , at least for now . The report revealed that Israel had been aware since the summer that Palestinian militants were using hardwired communication systems in the run up to the October attack . The Israeli military found a similar kind of communication system when it raided the city of Jenin in the northern West Bank in the summer , which was dubbed Operation Home and Garden . They discovered secure , hardwired communication lines and closed circuit surveillance cameras that could give advance warning of Israeli troop movements . At the time , the IDF said it hit a joint operational command centre used by militant cells in Jenin , and noted that it was used for advanced observation and reconnaissance . The IDF called it a hub for coordination and communication among the terrorists . Meanwhile , Israeli forces continued with their relentless assault on the besieged Gaza enclave in retaliation for the 7 October attack . Hamas , which controls the Gaza Strip , said people have died in the strikes so far . On Wednesday , international calls for a pause in fighting grew louder so that aid could reach Gaza .

              " 'At UN Podium , Erdan Shows UNGA Video Of Hamas Decapitation At Ceasefire Debate At UN Podium , Erdan Shows UNGA Video Of Hamas Decapitation At Ceasefire Debate Israel Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan on Thursday played a video of a Hamas terrorist trying to decapitate a Thai worker with a garden hoe during the October 7 onslaught in southern Israel . Updated Oct 27 , 2023 AM IST Israel Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan holds footage from Hamas October 7 massacre Israel Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan on Thursday , October 26 played a video at the General Assembly depicting Hamas terrorist attempting to harm a Thai worker with a garden tool during the October 7 onslaught in southern Israel . Erdan faced a challenging task in persuading General Assembly members not to support a Jordanian resolution demanding an immediate Gaza ceasefire , which did not mention Hamas . The resolution , which will come to a vote on Friday , is expected to pass given majority support for the Palestinians among member states . However , UNGA resolutions are non binding and largely symbolic . According to Times Of Israel , the text calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza , the release of all civilian hostages , the protection of civilians and international institutions , and ensuring the safe passage of humanitarian aid into the Strip . The draft resolution also calls on Israel to rescind its order for Palestinians in northern Gaza to evacuate to the south . Israel says the directive is to protect civilians as it apparently plans to launch a ground incursion that will focus on the northern part of the enclave . Palestinians note that some of those who have evacuated to the south have still been killed in Israeli airstrikes , and the UN resolution casts the measure as an attempt at forced transfer of the Palestinian civilian population . Israel war with Hamas in Gaza erupted after thousands of terrorists burst through the border and rampaged through more than 20 communities . The terrorists killed some people , the vast majority of them civilians , massacring them at their homes and at a music festival . They also abducted over 220 people to the Strip as hostages . At the outset of the emergency session on Gaza called by Jordan and Mauritania , Israel mission to the UN , in its effort to bolster opposition to the draft resolution , handed out sheets with a QR code that opens a video showing Hamas atrocities . Moreover , the images included piles of burned bodies , a baby shot in its bed , civilians lying dead in cars and in the street , and a gagged woman who had been burned to death . I have seen much footage over the past weeks that will be seared into my mind forever , but there is one sight that I keep on seeing when I try to sleep . In the video , one can see a terribly injured civilian bloodied , yet alive laying on the ground as a Hamas savage screaming Allahu Akbar repeatedly pummels the man neck with a garden hoe in order to decapitate him , the UN envoy said . The man on the ground is an agricultural worker from Thailand . He is not Israeli . He is not Jewish . He was merely alive , trying to make a living for his family . But he was decapitated with a blunt gardening tool . Horrifying ! Israel is not at war with human beings , we are at war with monsters , he added . Describing the horrific massacre , Erdan said the purpose of the terrorists was to savagely murder every living thing they encountered . Hamas Nazi murderers went from house to house with hit lists . The Israeli envoy insisted that This is not a war with the Palestinians . Israel is at war with the genocidal Hamas terrorist organization Modern day Nazis . Hamas does not care about the Palestinian people . Hamas has only one goal : to annihilate Israel , Erdan said . The drafters of the resolution claim to be concerned about peace , yet the depraved murderers who initiated this war are not even mentioned in the resolution , he said . They see each one of you as a puppet . They write a resolution completely devoid of any content related to the situation . They assume that you have already forgotten who it is that is responsible for the inhuman violence , and they just expect you to support it . This resolution is a disgrace to your intelligence . It is unfathomable that such a resolution one that does even mention Hamas could possibly be voted upon , he stated .',\n",
              " 'should stop backing Israeli genocide in Gaza , Iran tells UN TEHRAN Addressing the UN General Assembly on Thursday , Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian accused the of siding with the occupying regime of Israel in its relentless bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip . He also said the resistance forces who are fighting to liberate their stolen lands are branded as terrorists but say the Israeli regime that has occupied the Palestinian lands is defending itself . They call the Palestinian self liberation movement , which has a right to self defense , terrorists , but they refer to the occupying and war criminal regime Israel , that is committing genocide in Gaza , as having the right to self defense , Amir Abdollahian lamented . The and several European countries are watching and supporting the killing of about civilians in less than three weeks by the Israeli regime . They help this regime militarily and financially , he said , according to Al Jazeera . We recommend that the works for peace and security , not war against women and children and to stop sending rockets , tanks and bombs to be used against the people of Gaza . The should stop supporting genocide in Gaza and Palestine . President Joe Biden visited Tel Aviv on October 18 to express unwavering support for Israel in its relentless onslaught on the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip . The night before his arrival in Tel Aviv , Israeli fighter jets exploded Al Ahli al Arabi in the city of Gaza killing 500 civilians , including the injured , medical staff , and citizens who had taken shelter there from the Israeli bombardments . The bombardment of the hospital prompted Arab leaders , including the Palestinian Authority president and the king of Jordan , to cancel a meeting with Biden in Egypt . The has also aborted draft resolutions at the UN Security Council to halt the war . The Israeli war on Gaza , which is home to over 2 million people , has been described as genocide and war crime in terms of international law . After the Biden visit to the occupied territories , the leaders of Germany , Britain and France have visited Israel to express their solidarity with the occupation regime of Israel . The war started after the Hamas resistance group launched a surprise attack on portions of lands occupied by Israel in 1948 in retaliation to the regime brutal attacks on the Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank . Ethnic cleansing Richard Falk , an international law scholar who taught at Princeton University for forty years , has said the West refusal to call for a ceasefire is a green light to Israel ethnic cleansing . By failing to advocate for a ceasefire , western states have given a green light to Israel agenda of collective punishment , which might itself be grotesque cover for the regime end goal of massive dispossession and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people , Falk wrote in Middle East Eye on October 24 . UN chief says attack on Israel did not happen in a vacuum UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said the October 7 military operation against Israel did not happen in a vacuum , noting that the Palestinians have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation . The remarks by the world top diplomat angered Israel . The regime envoy to the UN , Gilad Erdan , called for the resignation of Guterres , saying Israel must rethink its relations with the world body . The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation . They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence ; their economy stifled ; their people displaced and their homes demolished . Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing , Guterres said . Following such remarks , the foreign minister of Israel also canceled his scheduled meeting with the UN chief . Also , in a post on X , Guterres said : \" The grievances of the Palestinian people can not justify the horrific attacks by Hamas .

              " 'Why is Recep Tayyip Erdogan backing Hamas against Israel ? What Turkey role in conflict ? Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan has upset Israel by calling Hamas liberators who are fighting for their homeland . Erdogan on Wednesday said while the West and Israel can view Hamas as a terrorist organisation , he views Hamas as mujahedeen holy warriors engaged in jihad . Erdogan also said he has cancelled his trip to Israel because of its inhumane war against Hamas in Gaza . Israel has been carpet bombing Gaza since the 7 October attack by Hamas left over dead and around 220 people as hostages . The Palestinian health ministry says more than Palestinians have been killed in the war including some minors a toll from the bombardment without precedent in the decades long Israeli Palestinian conflict . Worse , an even greater loss of life in Gaza is looking since Israel forces are preparing a ground invasion . But what did Erdogan say exactly ? Why is he backing Hamas ? And what Turkey role in the conflict ? Let take a closer look : What did Erdogan say ? As per The Times of Israel , Erdogan said that Israel and the West can view Hamas as a terrorist organization . The West owes you a lot . But Turkey does not owe you anything , Erdogan , addressing his AK party in Parliament said . Hamas is not a terrorist organization , it is a group of mujahideen defending their lands . Western tears shed for Israel are a manifestation of fraud , he added , as per Hindustan Times . Erdogan further said his plan to visit Israel is off . We had a project to go to Israel , but it was cancelled , we will not go , Erdogan added . I invite all other countries with reason and conscience to put pressure on the government to return the state of Israel to sanity , he added as per Politico . Erdogan met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a United Nations summit in New York last month , marking an improvement in relations that began with a decision last year to reappoint ambassadors . The Turkish leader did not say when he had intended to visit Israel , where Ankara had been eyeing joining a natural gas pipeline project promoted by the United States . Of course , we had good intentions , but Netanyahu abused them , Erdogan said . If he had continued with good intentions , our relations might have been different , but now , unfortunately , this will not happen either . Erdogan had initially struck a measured tone on the first day of war , condemning all attacks against civilians and urging Israel to be measured in its response . But he became much more vocal after the deadly strike on Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza last week , leading to large and angry protests across the Muslim world . It is clear that security can not be ensured by bombing hospitals , schools , mosques and churches , Erdogan said last week in a statement . I reiterate our call on the Israeli government not to expand the scope of its attacks against civilians and to immediately stop its operations that are bordering genocide . The Times of Israel noted that Erdogan is yet to condemn Hamas killings of Israel citizens . This is the first time Erdogan has struck such a tone about Hamas . Erdogan previously posted on X in 2018 , Hamas is not a terrorist organization and Palestinians are not terrorists . It is a resistance movement that defends the Palestinian homeland against an occupying power . Why is Erdogan backing Hamas ? For that , it is important to understand why Erdogan is hostile to Israel . Ankara relations with Israel have been strained since 2010 when an Israeli raid on a Turkish ship carrying aid into Gaza left 10 civilians dead . As per The Times of Israel , prior to that the two nations were long time allies . Since the incident , Netanyahu and Erdogan have repeatedly traded insults . Erdogan in 2014 accused Israel of keeping Hitler spirit alive amid a war with Gaza . Ties rebounded slightly , only for both nations to recall their ambassadors after violence broke out in Gaza and the Trump regime shifted its embassy to Jerusalem . Erdogan in December 2020 , facing economic headwinds domestically and diplomatic isolation globally , began signalling about being open to improving ties . In August , Israel and Turkey announced that diplomatic ties were completely restored , as per The Times of Israel . While there was some thawing of the relations lately , the Hamas attack and its aftermath have changed the equation yet again . Israel foreign ministry spokesperson posted on X : Israel wholeheartedly rejects the Turkish President harsh words about the terrorist organization Hamas . Hamas is a despicable terrorist organization worse than ISIS that brutally and intentionally murders babies , children , women and the elderly , takes civilians hostage and uses Lior Haiat October 25 , 2023 What is Turkey role in conflict ? Turkey in the past has pulled for a two state solution as the way to solve the Israel Palestine problem . However , under Erdogan , it has clearly backed Hamas . As per The Times of Israel , Turkey helmed by Erdogan has a long and lasting relationship with Hamas . Not only has Erdogan kept in touch with Hamas leadership since the war kicked off , he has even allowed the terror group to keep an office in Istanbul for more than a decade . Some have argued that Turkey is uniquely positioned to play peacemaker . Turkey has a good communication channel with Hamas , which is an important asset , Taha Ozhan , research director at the Ankara Institute , told Al Jazeera . It has been built up over 17 years , when Turkey was the only country to invite Hamas into its capital . Ozhan , a former chair of the Turkish parliament foreign affairs committee , added , In these times of crisis , the communication channels and relations are important . Turkey foreign minister Hakan Fidan has said Ankara is prioritising aid to Gaza and securing the release of hostages taken by Hamas . We have started discussing with the political section of Hamas , Fidan said . We been putting a lot of effort to make sure that children and foreigners especially are released . On Tuesday , Erdogan accused the United Nations Security Council where the United States , Britain and France have permanent seats of bowing to the Israeli regime . On Wednesday , he added : Those outside the region should stop pouring fuel into the fire . All parties should take their hands off the trigger and a ceasefire should be declared immediately Direct or indirect negotiations should be initiated to release the hostages . Erdogan is expected to appear at a massive rally in Istanbul on Saturday defending Palestinian right . What do experts say ? That Erdogan words have seemingly put paid to any notion that Ankara could act impartially . A piece in CFR contended that the Turkish people outpouring of sympathy for Gaza is only likely to further cement Erdogan bond with Hamas . Still , Erdogan sympathies for Hamas notwithstanding , he is also acutely aware that a major conflagration in the region would be detrimental to everyone , Turkey included . This explains why he reportedly warned his Iranian counterpart , Ebrahim Raisi , against steps that would increase tensions , the piece argued . The piece added that Erdogan is now looking at the relationship with Israel and the United States further going downhill . Erdogan could have initially contributed much to the search for a compromise in this conflict . He has eschewed the little trust Washington may have had in him with the stridency of his anti American language . He appears to have dealt himself out of the US led negotiations , the piece concluded . A piece in Foreign Policy said Erdogan made a personal choice to foster the relationship with Hamas . At this point , though , the Hamas relationship has deep roots in Turkey and will be difficult to uproot , the piece said . It added that no one takes Erdogan seriously due to his ties with Hamas . In charting such a course , Erdogan is once again acting in a manner that confirms the West deepest suspicions about his true affinities . As the Biden administration continues to shore up support for Israel through Secretary of State Antony Blinken shuttle diplomacy efforts , the only stop missing from his tour of the region is Ankara . Turkey appears to have made its choice to stand with Hamas , only because Erdogan wanted it this way , the piece concluded . But others put the ball squarely in the court of Israel and the West . Without talking about occupation , without talking about Palestine and Palestinians situation , there no room to move , it just talk , Ozhan told Al Jazeera . It depends on if Israel and the support it has coming from Washington and Europe are really interested in mediation . Ohan warned that a ripple effect could widen the conflict . The wise choice should be re establishing a political context and using this crisis as a leverage to create a political framework . But it depends on Israel and it depends on some Western capitals .

              " 'Israel Palestine war : At least people killed , yet tension continues to Latest updates The war between Israel and Palestine based militant group Hamas has escalated to an unprecedented level . What started on October 7 with Hamas militants attacking Israel is now dragging international players into its ambit . With the world watching this war carefully , Israel is expected to commence a ground invasion against Hamas militants , which the US fears could widen the conflict in the region . Here are some of the top updates from the Israel Palestine conflict French President Emmanuel Macron landed in Tel Aviv today . He met with the families of French citizens who were either killed or held hostage by the militants . Following this , he met Israeli officials and President Isaac Herzog . He told Herzog that he was in Israel to express France support and solidarity , and share your pain . He also wanted to assure that Israel is not left alone in the war against terrorism . Hamas has released two elderly Israeli women who were among the hundreds of hostages it had abducted during the October 7 attack . Yocheved Lifshitz , 85 , and Nurit Cooper , 79 , were taken out of Gaza at the Rafah crossing into Egypt , as per footage shown on Egyptian TV . The women were abducted by Hamas along with their husbands . Their husbands , ages 83 and 84 , were not released . Lifshitz daughter , Sharone Lifschitz , expressed her relief at her release adding she will remain focused on securing the release of her father and others . On Tuesday , Israel said it had launched 400 airstrikes over the past day . With the strikes , it managed to kill Hamas commanders . It also hit militants who were preparing to launch rockets at Israel and struck command centres and a Hamas tunnel shaft . The previous day Israel had reported 320 strikes . As per Palestinian official news agency WAFA , many of the airstrikes hit residential buildings and the buildings in southern Gaza where Israel had asked civilians to take shelter . A four storey building was hit in an overnight strike in the southern city of Khan Younis . The hit killed at least 32 people and wounded several others . As per Israel , the militants have fired over rockets at them since the beginning of the war . Hamas said it fired a new barrage on Tuesday morning . The UN on Monday said that at least million Palestinians in Gaza have had to flee their homes and around of them are taking shelter in UN run schools and shelters . The Israel Palestine war has so far killed over Palestinians . This includes some minors and around women , as per Hamas run Health Ministry said . This figure includes the people who died in an explosion at a hospital last week . The fighting has killed more than people in Israel mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack . On Monday , UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the explosion at the hospital was most likely caused by a missile fired from within Gaza and not by a rocket from Israel . The British government judges that the explosion was likely caused by a missile , or part of one , that was launched from within Gaza towards Israel , Sunak told parliament . A third aid convoy entered Gaza on Monday with a tiny fraction of supplies that the aid groups said were essential . With Agency inputs',\n",
              " 'Hamas wants casualties in the Gaza Strip To the editor : Israel follows the laws of war and international law and is trying to evacuate all the northern parts of the Gaza Strip and mainly the area of Gaza City , because this is the most crucial center of gravity of Hamas . Most of their assets are located there , and Israel does intend to harm innocent people , and Israel does want collateral damage . And therefore they are trying to convince the population to leave because the area is saturated with Hamas assets . The latest intelligence has produced evidence that now Hamas may be seeking the use chemical weapons . The reason that Israel must bomb and demolish so many buildings is because Hamas is everywhere where their basic organizing rationale is to use their people as human shields . They do it in the most cynical and brutal manner , and they wish to have casualties to use the international media and international tribunals in order to demonize Israel and gain empathy and support . It is the ultimate absurdity when these barbarians who do not respect any international law or norms are using these platforms to make their case . Israel has to clear the area and prepare the best conditions for ground forces to enter to accomplish the mission to deal with all underground infrastructure and to finish the job . We now know that Israel was falsely accused by Hamas of allegedly killing 500 in a hospital in Gaza , that turned out to be a misfire of a Hamas rocket . Again , Hamas wishes to have casualties to use the international media and international tribunals to demonize Israel and gain empathy and support . I reiterate that any support of Hamas , Iran , Hezbollah and any other radical ISIS movements , whether verbal or physical , should be addressed as an act of incitement when encouraging these heinous and barbaric acts . And , that any protest in the United States , whether in a congressional office building obstructing Congress , streets of America or on college campuses in support of this recent call for global jihad supporting these barbaric acts by Hamas and their partners , should be prosecuted the same manner as the incitement on 6 , 2021 on grounds of endangering public peace and safety . We have seen violence erupt from these recent Palestinian protest marches in New York City and other cities across the on the police and others .

              " 'The Alaska Airlines Attack I had a request to do another aviation story recently . As luck would have it , one popped up on Monday when an off duty Alaska Airlines pilot decided to try to kill everyone on board his flight . I not sure that there was a connection between the request and the incident , but I also ca be sure that there is . Who knows what awesome powers my readers might be tapped into , but let be careful what we ask for . Let start at the beginning . Alaska Airlines Flight 2059 is a regular flight from Everett , Washington KPAE to San Francisco KSFO . This flight was operated by Alaska regional codeshare partner , Horizon Air , and was flown with an Embraer 175 regional jet , an airplane that resembles a baby 737 but is typically configured for between 76 and 88 passengers . In the interest of full disclosure , I fly another Embraer product , the Legacy 500 , in my corporate aviation job . The two planes are both manufactured by the Brazilian aerospace company and are both sometimes referred to as jungle jets , but they are completely different types and I have never been trained on the 175 . On Sunday , an off duty pilot was commuting in the cockpit of the airliner when the pilot turned passenger , in the words of Alaska official statement , unsuccessfully attempted to disrupt the operation of the engines . The crew , the statement continues , quickly responded , engine power was not lost and the crew secured the aircraft without incident . Following appropriate FAA procedures and guidance from Air Traffic Control , the flight was safely diverted to Portland International Airport , Alaska says . The jump seat occupant the perpetrator is currently in custody and the event is being investigated by law enforcement authorities , which includes the FBI and the Port of Portland Police Department . The FlightAware track for the flight shows a 50 minute flight with a cruise altitude of feet . The flight is just south of Portland , Oregon KPDX when suddenly the plane begins a descent at a turn back to the north . Based on this depiction , it appears that the attack took place at about Pacific Time . The first question that many readers will have is why an off duty pilot was in the cockpit of an airliner in the first place . The simple answer is that he was on the way to work . He was scheduled to fly a 737 trip out of San Francisco later . Many airline pilots do live at their base . Airlines extend free or low cost travel benefits to their employees provided that the seat is not taken by a paying customer . At the companies I used to work for , this was called non revenue space available travel . Usually , it was shortened to non rev . Pilots have an additional privilege called jump seating . Airline cockpits contain a small foldout seat called a jumpseat where an additional occupant can sit inside the cockpit perched behind and between the two pilots . The jumpseat is intended for check airmen to observe the crew on line checks observations of a routine airline flight to ensure compliance with standard procedure , but the vast majority of the time , it goes unused . If the cabin seats are full , sometimes pilots commuting to or from their base are allowed to sit in the jump seat . If you seen the movie Catch Me If You Can , you seen the general way that jumpseating works . ABC News reports that the suspect was en route to San Francisco to work . The flight may have been full in the back so he had to ride on the jumpseat . For some reason , as yet undisclosed , he tried to pull the airplane throttles back and cause a crash . Reuters adds that the suspect tried to engage the engine fire suppression system . This is a key detail because most fire switches on jet airplanes do several things . The goal of pressing the switch is to stop a fire so it cuts off several items that could add fuel to a burning engine . These include closing shutoff valves for the fuel and hydraulic systems and removing electrical power from the engine . Additionally , engine fire extinguishers are armed , and bleed air valves are closed to prevent fiery hot air from moving to other parts of the plane . The fire switches are always a guarded switch with a cover that has to be opened before you can press it . Why ? Because pressing the switch cuts off a running engine , which is almost always a bad thing in an airborne aircraft . I say almost because there are certain times , such as when an engine is on fire , that shutting the engine down is preferable to keeping it running , but these are rare occurrences . The fact that the suspect flipped up a protective cover to try to press these fire switches and shut off the engines says a lot about his intent . He wanted to crash the airplane and kill everyone on board . I add that if the engines were shut down , they could be restarted , but under the circumstances , it is likely that there would have been a disaster . Restarting the engines is a complex procedure . That especially true if both engines are shut down , which would require the crew to maintain control of an airplane that is quickly losing energy . In this scenario , with a suicidal passenger in the cockpit trying to make you lose control , the odds would not have been good for success . The suspect in custody is Joseph David Emerson , 44 . Numerous outlets report that Emerson was I assume that it past tense by now a pilot with Alaska Airlines . No motive has been named , but there are several obvious possibilities . The new Hamas war has brought rumors of terrorist strikes in the US and there have been homegrown terrorist attacks by self radicalized American terrorists in the past . There is so far no evidence that Emerson was a radical Muslim , and the FAA said that the incident does not appear connected to world events . Far more likely is that Emerson was homicidal suicidal for personal reasons . Back in 2015 , I wrote an article about pilot suicides for the now defunct which is still available on my blog . A number of airline pilots have chosen to end their lives by taking their passengers and fellow crewmembers with them . Notable examples of crashes that are known or suspected to be the result of suicidal pilots include Germanwings Flight 9525 in 2015 , EgyptAir 990 in 1999 , Japan Air Lines 350 in 1982 , Malaysia 370 in 2014 , and China Eastern Airlines 5735 in 2022 . Interestingly , this is the first time that a suicidal employee has targeted Horizon Air . In 2018 , a disgruntled mechanic stole a De Havilland turboprop airliner and performed an impromptu airshow before crashing it into an island in Puget Sound . Only the hijacker was killed in that incident . There has also been at least one case of a cockpit jumpseater attacking the crew in the flight . Back in 1994 , a jumpseater on a FedEx freighter attacked the crew with hammers , a knife , and a spear gun that he had carried on board in a guitar case . The crew fought back and ultimately subdued the suicidal hijacker , a FedEx flight engineer , with the help of aerial maneuvers that made it difficult for him to stay upright . Through the years , I have also seen rumors that at least some of the September 11 hijackers were in the jumpseat , but I have never seen this confirmed . Nevertheless , the entire industry response to hijackings changed after those attacks . Those changes included strengthened cockpit doors and more stringent security measures for jumpseaters . New measures also included the Federal Flight Deck Officer and Federal Air Marshal programs . FFDOs were pilots deputized to carry guns to protect their airplanes . The fact that Joseph David Emerson , 44 , is still alive to see 45 is evidence that no FFDO or Air Marshal was on board Alaska 2059 . As to why Emerson would try to kill himself and a planeload of passengers , I can only speculate . Previous motives for pilot suicides have included mental illness , job pressures , and family and financial problems . Airline flying can be stressful and the current work environment is one that can include a lot of time away from home and exhausting schedules . Airline jobs are notoriously rough on marriages and can lead to what is sometimes termed as AIDS , Aviation Induced Divorce Syndrome . This , in turn , can lead to financial problems . Back in August , a United Airlines pilot was arrested after assaulting a parking lot gate with an ax at Denver International Airport . CBS News reported that the pilot told sheriff deputies that he just hit his breaking point . The Daily Mail reports that Emerson was the married father of two boys who seemed to be the perfect father and husband . Still , personal strife can be difficult to diagnose from next door . The Mail also reports that Emerson lives with his family in Pleasant Hill , California , a San Francisco suburb , so it was clear why he was flying to San Francisco from Everett , but the answer to that question might provide a motive . The incident seems to have been handled discretely at the time . It is clear if any passengers or law enforcement officers traveling on the flight helped to subdue and restrain Emerson , but there have been some indications that it may have been a momentary lapse on Emerson part rather than a determined attack . Passengers told ABC News that they were told that there was a disturbance in the cockpit and that Emerson had suffered a mental breakdown . It was very professional , handled very calmly , and we did really know what was going on until we landed , passenger Alex Wood said . Emerson now faces 83 counts of attempted murder and a host of other charges . It may be fortunate that he snapped when he did rather than later as a crewmember at the controls .',\n",

China CCTV said Li Kepiang was in Shanghai when he suffered a heart attack on Thursday midnight around AM . Li Kepiang was also the contender to succeed then Communist Party leader Hu Jintao in 2013 but things happened in the favour of Xi , who centralised powers in his hand . As the top economic official , Li promised to improve conditions for entrepreneurs who generate jobs and wealth . But the ruling party under Xi increased the dominance of state industry and tightened control over tech and other industries . Advertisement Foreign companies said they felt unwelcome after Xi and other leaders called for economic self reliance , expanded an anti spying law and raided offices of consulting firms . Li was dropped from the Standing Committee at a party congress in October 2022 despite being two years below the informal retirement age of 70 . Advertisement The same day , Xi awarded himself a third five year term as party leader , discarding a tradition under which his predecessors stepped down after 10 years . Xi filled the top party ranks with loyalists , ending the era of consensus leadership and possibly making himself leader for life . The slot was filled by Li Qiang , the party secretary for Shanghai , who lacked Li Keqiang national level experience and later told reporters that his job was to do whatever Xi decided .

Photo : Reuters Israel security services are pulling in spyware companies , including the maker of the notorious Pegasus software , to help track hostages in the Gaza Strip , people familiar with the matter say . NSO Group and Candiru , both of which are blacklisted by the United States , are being asked to quickly upgrade their spyware capabilities to meet needs laid out by the country security forces , according to four cybersecurity industry sources and an Israeli government official . Several other software firms are also collaborating on the requests and largely offering their services for free , said the people , who asked not to be identified because of they were not authorised to comment on military operations . The defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment . The Israel Defense Forces and NSO , which makes Pegasus , declined to comment . Thailand , where democracy activists were targeted , is among 45 countries where the research group CitizenLab said Pegasus spyware has been detected . NSO maintains that it sells Pegasus only to governments but it has never been established which Thai state entity acquired the spyware and for what purposes . Candiru , meanwhile , said it a statement that it was ready to assist the Israeli war effort in any way needed . More than 200 people mainly Israelis but also several foreigners including 18 Thais are captive in Gaza . Just four have been released so far . The Israeli newspaper Haaretz , which first reported the involvement of the spyware companies in efforts to locate the hostages or their captors , said the surveillance companies Rayzone and Paragon were also assisting . Though Israel has never publicly severed ties with NSO and Candiru , the Israel Defense Forces dismissed some of their employees from military reserve duty after the firms were sanctioned in the US for helping authoritarian regimes track journalists and dissidents . Pegasus software is sold to governments and law enforcement agencies , which use it to hack into mobile phones and covertly record emails , phone calls and text messages . Amnesty International , Citizen Lab and Forensic Architecture in 2021 documented the use of the spyware in more than 60 cases to target government critics in many countries . In addition to Thailand , they included Rwanda , Togo , Spain , the United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia , Mexico , Morocco and India . The US Commerce Department blacklisted NSO and Candiru that year , banning them from receiving export contracts from American companies . That led Israel to significantly curtail the number of countries where the technologies could legally be sold . Now the government may rethink its approach to these firms , according to Gabi Siboni , a colonel in the reserves and expert on cyber security and military strategy at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security . There will have to be a change in how Israel relates to offensive cyber , Siboni said . I expect there will be more budget alloted to this sector .',\n",

This is false . It was the opposite , \" Guterres told reporters at the UN Security Council stakeout here . \" I believe it was necessary to set the record straight especially out of respect to the victims and to their families , \" he said . In remarks that angered Israel , Guterres had told the Security Council ministerial meeting on Tuesday on the Israel Hamas conflict that it is \" important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum . \" \" The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation . They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence ; their economy stifled ; their people displaced and their homes demolished . Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing , he said . Following these remarks , Israel Foreign Minister Eli Cohen , who had participated in the Security Council session , cancelled his meeting with Guterres that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in the UN headquarters . Later , talking to reporters at the UN Security Council stakeout , Israel Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan lashed out at Guterres , saying his remarks in the Council were unfathomable . \" You , Secretary General , have lost all morality and impartiality . Because when you say those terrible words that these heinous attacks did not happen in a vacuum , you are tolerating terrorism and by tolerating terrorism , you are justifying terrorism , Erdan said . Erdan had said that Hamas beheaded babies , burnt families , raped women and abducted kids , babies and Holocaust survivors but the Secretary General is blaming Israel and the victim . \" This is a pure blood libel .

Meanwhile , on Thursday , India reiterated its stance on the UN backed two state solution to resolve ages old Israel Palestine conflict which has resulted in countless deaths and tragedies on both sides of the fence . Addressing media persons , External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi stated that the international community must come together in combatting terrorism in all its forms and manifestations . Furthermore , Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to the President of the Palestine Authority , Mahmoud Abbas , and conveyed his condolences over the killing of 470 people in the bombing of a hospital in Gaza . Although the contemporary dynamics of the Israel Palestine conflict are widely recognized , with Palestinians asserting that Israel was established in their homeland through force , and Israel asserting its legitimate right to exist in its Biblical homeland , it essential to understand the origins of Jewish migration to Israel . Before the official proclamation of Israel creation in May 1948 , what were the factors that paved the way for it ? What roles did the British and other Arab powers play in this historical context ? Read this full article . Advertisement Anti semitism and Zionism As per the Hebrew Bible , Israel is the name God gave to Jacob , the grandson of Abraham , who is considered the patriarch of all three Abrahamic religions Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . The of Abraham established their roots in Canaan , an area that approximately corresponds to the present day territory of Israel . Trending Now Fast forward to the late century , and Canaan , previously governed by a series of empires including the Greeks , Romans , Persians , Crusaders , and various Islamic powers , found itself under the rule of the Ottoman Sultanate . During this period , the Jewish community , known as Jews , was dispersed across numerous nations , often thriving as prosperous minorities but susceptible to persecution , particularly in Europe . Advertisement During the in Imperial Russia , there were violent pogroms directed at the Jewish population . In France , the Dreyfus affair of 1894 , involving the false conviction of a Jewish soldier for allegedly sharing crucial information with Germany , brought to the forefront the widespread anti Semitic biases of the era . Consequently , within the Jewish community , a sense began to develop that their safety and security would only be assured if they had a nation of their own . This movement , aimed at establishing a Jewish homeland , became recognized as Zionism . In 1896 , Theodor Herzl , an Austro Hungarian individual , released a pamphlet titled Der Judenstaat , outlining his vision for a Jewish nation . This pamphlet gained significant recognition , establishing Herzl as the pioneer of political Zionism . In the initial stages , various regions including Uganda and Argentina were contemplated as potential sites for this homeland . Nevertheless , consensus eventually gravitated toward Palestine , the biblical homeland of the Jews , housing numerous sacred sites from their heritage . Before World War 1 In due course , Jewish migration , known as Aliyah , to Palestine was set in motion . The initial influx , spanning from 1881 to 1903 , is referred to as the First Aliyah . These newcomers started to acquire extensive land holdings and engaged in agriculture . It was long before the presence of these arrivals began to impact the native Palestinian population , although it would take several years before the conflict would be explicitly characterized in these divisive terms . During this era , Palestine was simply a single province within the sprawling and often poorly administered Ottoman Empire . The inhabitants did not inherently consider themselves as Palestinians , but rather identified with broader categories such as Ottoman subjects , Arabs , and Muslims , or aligned themselves along clan and familial affiliations . A prevailing practice was absentee landlordism , whereby land was sold to Jews by property owners who were not resident in those areas , as well as by Ottoman officials who were susceptible to bribery . The local residents , who were the actual cultivators of the land , were typically rural , economically disadvantaged , and had limited literacy , and consequently , they had limited influence in these transactions . With the arrival of these new settlers , it swiftly became apparent that they had no intention of assimilating into the local culture . Unlike the Jewish communities that had longstanding roots in Palestine , these recent arrivals had limited knowledge of Arabic and were primarily associated with their own community . While in the past , Arab laborers were employed to work on their farms , the increasing influx of Jewish immigrants made this practice less common . Furthermore , previously , when the land changed ownership , the tenants typically continued working under the new landlord . However , when the land was purchased by a Jewish owner , Arab tenants were often displaced , losing their homes and communities in the process . The Jewish population distinguished themselves from the local inhabitants in various ways , often asserting their perceived superior status . They introduced mechanized agriculture and brought in electricity , aligning with their mission to establish an ideal homeland . They did not readily adopt local customs , and their towns and settlements , exemplified by Tel Aviv founded in 1909 , reflected European sensibilities , standing in stark contrast to the modest Arab neighborhoods . The enterprise in Israel received substantial funding from wealthy Jewish benefactors abroad , including notable figures like the Rothschild family . As the Jewish presence in Palestine expanded , local apprehension and resentment toward these newcomers intensified . While Ottoman officials did prohibit the sale of land to foreign Jews , this decree was not effectively enforced . In 1908 , following the overthrow of the Ottoman Sultan in the Young Turks revolution , Jewish migration efforts became more organized and systematic . Simultaneously , Jews in other countries worked to garner international support for their cause . The Balfour Declaration One pivotal moment that potentially reshaped the landscape of West Asia was the Balfour Declaration of 1917 . In this landmark event , a letter from a British official to a wealthy British Jew played a decisive role in determining the future of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians . British Mandate and World War II Following the downfall of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I , its erstwhile domains were divided among the Allies , with the eventual aim of promoting self governance . UN Resolution and Wars In November 1947 , the UN General Assembly passed a resolution to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states , with Jerusalem placed under UN administration . According to Black book , The proposed Jewish state was allocated 55 percent of the territory , including the sparsely populated Negev desert , and it was expected to be home to around Jews and Arabs . The Arab state was designated to possess 44 percent of the land and had a minority population of Jews . The Arab areas encompassed the West Bank and Gaza . The Palestinian side rejected this resolution , leading to Israel declaring independence on May 14 , 1948 . This period was marked by civil war , witIsraeli military groups forcibly displacing many Palestinians . For Palestinians , the establishment of Israel is remembered as the Naqba , or the catastrophe , symbolizing the day they lost their homeland . Israel faced invasion from Egypt , Jordan , Iraq , Syria , and Lebanon after declared independence . Nevertheless , with unwavering support from the US , Israel successfully repelled these major attacks . This was followed by more Arab Israeli wars , resulting in Israel gaining control over significant territories . It is worth noting that , Today , out of the 193 UN member states , 139 recognize Palestine , while 165 recognize Israel . The Gaza Strip and the West Bank remain under Israeli military control .

              " 'Why Israel fears Hamas tunnels Tunnel warfare is a battlefield challenge as old as time , yet in the modern era , it continues to confound even the mightiest of military forces . Throughout history , from the Battle of Iwo Jima 70 years ago to the relentless persistence of the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War , underground tunnels have proven to be formidable obstacles . In the Battle of Iwo Jima , American forces clashed with fierce resistance on the small island in the Pacific during World War II . The Japanese defenders had burrowed an extensive network of tunnels and underground bunkers , which became a nightmarish obstacle for the troops . The subterranean labyrinth allowed the enemy to hide , ambush , and wage a prolonged defence , defying conventional tactics and lengthening the battle . Fast forward to the jungles of Vietnam , where Viet Cong soldiers adopted a similar strategy . They used a vast and intricate tunnel system to resist the might of the United States military during the Vietnam War . These tunnels provided not only shelter but also ingenious pathways for the guerrilla fighters to evade , attack , and disappear , making it one of the most elusive and challenging conflicts in modern warfare . As Israel stands poised for a possible ground invasion of Gaza , a daunting obstacle looms beneath the surface , threatening to complicate an already complex and treacherous mission . This subterranean challenge is none other than the extensive network of tunnels meticulously built by the Hamas militants , turning the battleground into a nightmare for any invading force . These tunnels , stretching hundreds of kilometres , have been referred to as the \" metro . \" This hidden challenge has turned Gaza into a nightmarish battlefield for the Israeli military , making an already complicated mission even more treacherous as the 200 hostages are kept in these tunnels . Over 200 hostages are believed to be hidden possibly in a labyrinth that Hamas has built beneath the enclave , even as Israeli warplanes pound the territory ahead of a threatened invasion , killing more than Palestinians . The extensive tunnel network is more than just a threat ; it a lifeline for Hamas . These passages allow the militant group to endure relentless bombardments , move covertly within Gaza , resupply their forces , conceal hostages , and execute surprise attacks . These tunnels , often reinforced with concrete and reaching astonishing depths , are wired for electricity and communication , enabling Hamas to operate in the shadows , hidden from the watchful eyes above . Resourceful and tactically adept , Hamas considers itself to be a master of asymmetric warfare , where a smaller force can outsmart a numerically stronger opponent , something that could pose huge problems for Israel if it launches a ground offensive within Gaza . Remember , the Hamas know that the Israelis are coming for them and they are prepared for the guerilla warfare inside the tunnels . To counter this subterranean challenge , Israel has specialised units , such as Yahalom , dedicated to combating underground warfare . In the past they have also deployed bunker busters , which provide a means to engage the enemy from a distance , minimising the risks to their own forces . Now , according to a renowned US journalist , Israeli military leadership is considering inundating the underground tunnels of Hamas before launching a ground invasion into Gaza . Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh has written that the Israeli leadership was even willing to sacrifice those who might currently be held hostages in these tunnels . As Israel prepares to invade the Gaza Strip , many families of hostages seized by Hamas are pleading with the government to rein in the war effort and instead negotiate the release of their loved ones . Highlighting the appalling dilemma facing the whole country , other relatives warn that mediation could take years and say their best hope lies with the military , hoping ground forces could find the missing men , women and children before it is too late . In the face of this unseen peril , Israel must tread carefully , for beneath the sandy soil of Gaza lies a clandestine world of danger , waiting to confront any who venture below . Tunnel warfare , a historical and persistent tactic , remains a formidable foe , an ever evolving threat that transcends time and technology . The decision to launch a ground invasion is now in the hands of the Israeli government , even as pressure builds from its allies over the shape and parameters of the operation .',\n",

He noted , It shows that the Israeli regime practices systematic apartheid not only against Muslims but also against the followers of all Abrahamic religions , including Christians . The top Iranian diplomat highlighted Vatican role in preventing war crimes against civilians , especially women and children , and the delivery of aid to the people of Gaza . He added , Undoubtedly , the united voice of Muslims , Christians and Jews in countering the Zionist regime crimes will play an effective role in putting a bridle on the extremism of the Zionists , and restoration of peace to the world and the establishment of moral values .',\n",

              " 'Israel bombards Gaza , prepares invasion as Biden urges path to two states Israel kept up its strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza as it prepared for a ground invasion while more Palestinian civilians were killed and world powers at the United Nations failed to secure plans to deliver critical humanitarian aid . President Joe Biden , in remarks looking beyond the war that began with an 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian Hamas militants , said on Wednesday that the future should include Israeli and Palestinian states side by side . \" Israelis and Palestinians equally deserve to live side by side in safety , dignity and in peace , \" Biden said at a joint press conference in Washington with visiting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese . Biden said he believed one reason the Islamist Hamas group attacked southern Israel , killing people and taking more than 200 hostages of different nationalities , was to prevent normalising relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia . Israeli retaliatory strikes have killed over people , the health ministry in the Hamas run strip said on Wednesday . Reuters has been unable to independently verify casualty figures . Over rockets have been fired towards Israel since 7 out of Gaza , according to Israeli government data , while there have been repeated clashes along the northern border . Israel Magen David Adom ambulance service said two people were being treated for shrapnel and glass wounds after a rocket fired from Gaza on Wednesday night struck the central Israeli city of Rishon Letzion , south of Tel Aviv . AID PROPOSALS FAIL IN UN SECURITY COUNCIL VOTES At the United Nations , Russia and China vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for pauses in hostilities to allow much needed food , water and medicine to be delivered to Palestinian civilians . The United Arab Emirates also voted no , while 10 members voted in favour and two abstained . Russia made a rival proposal that advocated a wider ceasefire , but failed to win the minimum number of votes . Israel has resisted both , arguing that Hamas would only take advantage and create new threats to Gaza civilians . Limited deliveries of food , medicine and water from Egypt restarted on Saturday through Rafah , the only crossing not controlled by Israel . INVASION PREPARATIONS Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas , which rules Gaza . \" We will keep striking in Gaza in order to achieve the goals of the war , \" Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said . \" Every strike strengthens us and improves our situation ahead of the next stages in the war . \" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised statement that Israel was \" preparing for a ground invasion . I will not elaborate on when , how or how many . \" Israeli tanks and troops are massed on the border with Gaza awaiting orders . Israel has called up reservists . International pressure is growing to delay any invasion of Gaza , not least because of hostages . More than half the estimated 220 hostages held by Hamas have foreign passports from 25 different countries , the Israeli government said . Many were believed to have had dual Israeli nationality . The Wall Street Journal , citing and Israeli officials , reported that Israel had agreed to delay invading Gaza for now so that the United States could rush missile defences to the region to protect forces there , reflecting its concern the Gaza war may spread to other parts of the Middle East . officials have so far persuaded Israel to hold off until air defence systems can be placed in the region , as early as this week , the Journal said . Asked about the report , officials told Reuters that Washington had raised its concerns with Israel that Iran and Iranian backed Islamist groups could escalate the conflict by attacking troops in the Middle East . An Israeli incursion into Gaza could be a trigger for Iranian proxies , they said .',\n",
              " 'Erdogan says Hamas is not a terrorist outfit , cancels Tel Aviv visit Macron , Sisi urge return to peace process Jordan queen rues West glaring double standard Sunak backs humanitarian pause Khamenei says US directing Israel bombing ANKARA : Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan , in his strongest comments yet on the Gaza crisis , said on Wednesday the Hamas was not a terrorist organisation but a liberation group fighting to protect Palestinian lands . Hamas is not a terrorist organisation , it is a liberation group , mujahideen waging a battle to protect its lands and people , he told lawmakers from his ruling AK Party , using an Arabic word denoting those who fight for their faith . Erdogan also slammed Western powers for supporting Israel bombing of Gaza and called for an immediate ceasefire , the unhindered entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza and for Muslim countries to work together to stop the violence . Erdogan accused Israel of taking advantage of Turkiye good intentions and said he had cancelled a previously planned visit to Israel . I shook the hand of this man named Netanyahu one time in my life , Erdogan said , referring to his meeting with Israeli prime minister at the UN General Assembly last month . Meanwhile , in Cairo , French President Emmanuel Macron met his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al Sisi on Wednesday called for a de escalation , ceasefire and return to diplomacy , stressing that the lack of a political horizon had led to the current unrest . Macron echoed Sisi support for a two state solution . It is difficult at the moment to talk about the resumption of a peace process , Macron said at the joint news conference , adding however that it is more necessary than ever . Regarding a ground intervention by Israeli forces in Gaza , Macron said If it is entirely targeted against terrorist groups , that is a choice that it has , but if it is a massive operation that would endanger civilian populations , in that case I think it would be an error for Israel , Macron told reporters in Egypt . Earlier , Jordan King Abdullah II , who hosted Macron on Tuesday , warned against the continuation of the war on the Gaza Strip , which might lead to an explosion in the situation in the region . He also visited the occupied West Bank for talks with Mahmud Abbas , president of the Palestinian Authority . Double standard Jordanian Queen Rania accused Western leaders of a glaring double standard for not condemning Israel killing of Palestinian civilians in its bombardment of Gaza , in an interview aired on Wednesday . The people all around the Middle East , including in Jordan , we are just shocked and disappointed by the world reaction to this catastrophe that is unfolding . In the last couple of weeks , we have seen a glaring double standard in the world , she told CNN Christiane Amanpour . But what we seeing in the last couple of weeks , we seeing silence in the world , she said . Are we being told that it is wrong to kill a family , an entire family , at gunpoint , but it OK to shell them to death ? Queen Rania asked . Queen Rania said of the West refusal to back a ceasefire that the silence is deafening and , to many in our region , it makes the Western world complicit through their support and through the cover that they give Israel . British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told parliament on Wednesday he supported a humanitarian pause in Gaza to allow the safe delivery of aid to civilians , but he rejected calls for a full ceasefire . We recognise for all of that to happen , there has to be a safer environment , which of course necessitates specific pauses as distinct from a ceasefire , Sunak said to lawmakers at a weekly parliamentary question and answer session . Later on Wednesday a plane landed in Egypt to deliver humanitarian supplies to people in Gaza . However , Sunak spokesman said full ceasefire would only benefit Hamas . Iran supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said The United States is in some way directing the crime that is being committed in Gaza , adding that the hands of Americans were tainted with the blood of the oppressed , children , patients , women and others . America is a definite accomplice of criminals , said Khamenei during a speech in Tehran . Let everyone know that in this matter and future matters , the Palestinian nation is victorious and the future world is the world of Palestine , not the world of the Zionist regime , Khamenei said , referring to Israel .

              " 'Anti Islamic State coalition be included in fight against Hamas : France Macron French President Emmanuel Macron proposed on Tuesday that an international coalition fighting against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria be widened to include the fight against the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza . Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem , Macron stressed that France and Israel share terrorism as their \" common enemy \" , but gave little detail on how the US led coalition of dozens of countries could be involved . advertisement \" France is ready for the international coalition against Daesh in which we are taking part for operations in Iraq and Syria to also fight against Hamas , \" he told reporters , referring to Islamic State and promising not to leave Israel alone . Macron also warned against the risks of a regional conflict , stressing the fight against Hamas \" must be without mercy but not without rules \" . Thirty French citizens were killed by Hamas militants in their attack on southern Israel on 7 . The French president , who met families of French victims at Tel Aviv airport , said freeing nine French hostages was the first priority for France . \" They must all be freed , \" he said . Earlier , Macron told President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem that France stood \" shoulder to shoulder \" with Israel . Beyond showing solidarity , Macron wanted to make \" proposals that are as operational as possible \" to prevent an escalation , to free hostages , and guarantee Israel security and work towards a two state solution , presidential advisers said . He will push for a humanitarian truce , they added . Macron visit comes after European Union foreign ministers on Monday struggled to agree on a call for a \" humanitarian pause \" in the war between Israel and Hamas to allow much more aid to reach civilians . Mahmoud Abbas office said Macron would meet the Palestinian leader in Ramallah , in the West Bank . SOFT POWER FADED Macron ability to influence events in the region appears limited by what some analysts say is a shift towards a more pro Israel Anglo American line , in contrast with the traditionally distinctive and more pro Arab French Gaullist approach . \" France soft power south of the Mediterranean has considerably faded , \" said Karim Emile Bitar , a Beirut based foreign policy expert at French think tank IRIS . \" We under the impression that nothing distinguishes France from other Western countries now , \" he said . The French government decision to adopt a blanket ban on pro Palestinian protests , before it was struck down by courts , is one reason Macron has lost credit in the Arab world , he said . French officials contest the idea that Macron policy is biased . They say Macron has constantly reaffirmed the rights of Palestinians and the position of a two state solution . Macron visit will also have a special resonance at home , where France large Muslim and Jewish communities are on tenterhooks following the killing of a teacher by an Islamist militant that French officials have linked to the events in Gaza . advertisement The French leader will have to tread a fine line during his tour of the region , the Israeli Palestinian conflict having stoked tension at home and with France fractious opposition ready to pounce on any faux pas . The coalition fighting Islamic State was formed in September 2014 and has supported local partners \" to deliver the military defeat of Daesh in Iraq and Syria \" and \" works to advise , assist and enable \" them , including with reconnaissance and intelligence , it says on its website .

              " 'A Deeper Look : Why International Law Failed to Prevent Harm to Civilians Part 3 Share post Robin Fleming In this third and final part of A Deeper Look I want to analyse another contemporary instance of blatant and unabashed war crimes being committed by another signatory of the Geneva Conventions , who is also subject to International Humanitarian Law IHL . That signatory is Turkey , and though it has been receiving less media attention in the shadow of recent events in Israel and Palestine , Turkish armed forces have also been conducting a military campaign that is intentionally and primarily targeting infrastructure in Kurdish majority regions of North and East Syria NES . This is according to Turkey own claims . On 4 October , Hakan Fidan , the Turkish foreign minister , warned at the start of the recent operations that , From now on , all infrastructure , superstructure facilities and energy facilities belonging to PKK YPG in Iraq and Syria are the legitimate target of our security forces . This statement refers to the PKK , or the Kurdistan Workers Party , and the YPG , the Peoples Protection Units . Turkey considers the PKK , which has its root in southern Turkey , a terrorist organisation , and further more claims that a number of Syrian Kurdish political , civil and military groups are one and the same as the PKK . The YPG , a group led by Syrian Kurds who worked in coordination with the global coalition against ISIS to defeat the terrorist group , have been particularly maligned by Turkey who also refers to them as terrorists . Fidan then continued his warning : I recommend that third parties stay away from PKK YPG facilities and individuals . There is a lot to unpack there . Firstly , it is bizarre a government official such as Fidan would publicly announce his intention to militarily target infrastructure , as it is directly prohibited by Article 54 of IHL . Keep in mind , even if as he claims , these facilities are owned by the PKK or YPG , if the facilities are relied on for nonmilitary purposes and to supply water and food stuffs to civilian populations , this is irrefutably a war crime . If the destruction of these facilities leads to starvation or forced displacement then Turkeys actions constitute a war crime . Fidan essentially acknowledges civilians could potentially be harmed by the targeting of infrastructure facilities when he warns third parties to stay away . Those third party people are civilians . And it is not a civilian duty to avoid being in proximity to a bakery , for example , where they may need to buy bread . According to Rule 1 of International Law , the responsibility is on the armed parties of a conflict to distinguish between civilian and combatant , not on the civilian to make themselves more distinguishable . The narratives we see at play here are so eerily similar to the narratives Israel is using . Firstly , painting an entire population as equal to one militant group : in Israel case Hamas and in Turkey the PKK . Secondly , both put responsibility on the civilian to distance themselves from the militant group and claim their hands are clean if there are any casualties . Israel does this by claiming any dead civilian was being used as a human shield and so they are not to blame , and Turkey does this by telling third parties to steer clear of any infrastructure , even those necessary for sustenance and life , which Turkey deems tainted . Now that we know what Turkey threatened to do , let look at what it done and the disastrous affects it had on the people of NES . Both ReliefWeb , a humanitarian information service , and the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria AANES have published reports detailing the damage sustained since Turkey began its new bombardment campaign in the beginning of October . The comprehensive report from the AANES reveals that Turkish armed forces carried out as many as 304 strikes between 4 and 10 October , hitting 224 locations in NES . These strikes consisted of artillery , mortars , drones and airstrikes . According to the report , in this period of time , significant damage was done to power plants , medical centres , oil facilities , industrial areas and also caused significant material damage to the vicinity of a number of camps for internally displaced persons IDPs . In this time , 47 people were killed , and at least 55 injured . Tragically , these numbers are only rising since 10 October . Next I turn to the ReliefWeb report , published 16 October , which lays out the exact extent of the damage , and more importantly the expected impact on the civilian population . For example , the report includes a graphic showing that prior to the Turkish airstrikes , percent of electricity needs were able to be supplied from Tabqa Dam , Swediyeh , and Jebsa . After the Turkish airstrikes , the productivity of all of these electricity stations fell dramatically . Meaning now percent of the population can not have their needs met . The report says : With this , only 11 percent of Hasakah governorate electricity needs are being met . Some areas including those reliant on damaged transfer stations are entirely without electricity . This impacts every aspect of daily life . The severe lack of electricity will drastically reduce access to clean and safe water . The Alouk water station was reliant on electricity from one of the damaged stations . Now Alouk is not operational , impacting more than civilians in Hasakah and the surrounding areas . A water station providing drinking water to the Malikiyah subdistrict only has access to approximately three hours of electricity per day according to ReliefWeb . As a result , the station is only about to provide water to 12 percent of the city population . This is just one of six water stations the report mentioned as having been damaged . I will take the time now to remind you of the second point in Article 54 of IHL . It is prohibited to attack , destroy , remove or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population , such as drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works . Turkey actions , within such a short time frame , impacted hundreds of thousands of civilians access to water in just one region of NES . It is not within Hakan Fidan power to declare that this infrastructure is now a legitimate target as he tried to do on 4 October , no matter what he says , Turkeys actions are demonstrably in violation with both the spirit and letter of IHL . As heartbreaking as seeing this destruction on any civilian area is , as we see in Gaza and in NES , what makes it even worse is the complete failure of other signatories of the Geneva Convention , and other countries sworn to uphold the principles of international humanitarian law to prevent these violations from occurring . Civilian causalities have become so normalised in modern warfare , all an aggressor needs is to blame the civilians themselves for their proximity to legitimate targets . What is clear is that we need a renewal of commitment to the principle of IHL . We , the international community , need to re imagine it and strengthen it so it is not so easy to ignore the cries and the suffering of innocent civilians .

These include forces that have been on prepare to deploy orders , and which are deploying from the continental United States , Pentagon spokesman Brig . Pat Ryder told reporters on Thursday . Deployed and deploying units include a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery from Fort Bliss Texas , Patriot batteries from Fort Sill , Oklahoma , Patriot and Avenger batteries from Fort Liberty , North Carolina , and associated air defense headquarters elements from Fort Bliss and Fort Cavazos , Texas . Ryder added that the deploying units would not be going to Israel and are intended to support regional deterrence efforts and further bolster US force protection capabilities . The Pentagon previously announced the deployment of the THAAD and Patriot batteries . As the war between Israel and Hamas continues , the US is seeking to send a strong message to adversaries to prevent the conflict spreading more widely in the region . CNN has reported that the US has intelligence that Iranian backed militia groups are planning to ramp up attacks against US forces in the Middle East , as Iran seeks to capitalize on the backlash in the region to US support for Israel . Ryder said Thursday that between October 17 and 26 , US and coalition forces have been attacked at least 12 separate times in Iraq , four separate times in Syria , by a mix of one way attack drones and rockets . A total of 21 US service members have received minor injuries as a result of attacks between October 17 and 18 , CNN reported Wednesday . Of those , 19 15 at al Asad Air Base in Iraq and four at al Tanf Garrison in Syria have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury TBI , Ryder said . All have since returned to duty , he added , and there have been no injuries or no reported cases of TBI since the and of October . An attack on Thursday , Ryder said , targeted Erbil Airbase and was unsuccessful with no casualties and some minor damage to infrastructure . The announcement on Thursday comes after the Pentagon put roughly US troops on prepare to deploy orders last week , which Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said were focused on providing air defense , security , logistics , medical , intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance , and transportation support . That is in addition to US troops already in Iraq and Syria roughly and 900 , respectively and Navy assets that were announced to be heading to the region . The USS Dwight Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group has been directed to the Middle East , and the USS Gerald Ford Carrier Strike Group is currently in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea . Asked Thursday to explain the delay in response to attacks on US forces , Ryder said the US military maintains the inherent right of defending our troops and we will take all necessary measures to protect our forces and our interests overseas . As it relates to these groups , again , we know that these are Iranian backed militia groups that are supported by Iran , and of course , we hold Iran responsible for these groups , he said .',\n",

Those meetings could set the stage for a summit between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping next month on the sidelines of an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum leaders gathering in San Francisco . The has been disappointed with China over its support for Russia in the war against Ukraine and its relative silence on the Middle East . In addition , the world two largest economies are at odds on issues such as human rights , climate change , Taiwan , the South China Sea , and North Korea .

And Blinken spoke just last week with Wang about the Israel Hamas crisis . The goal , according to officials , is to set the stage for another Biden Xi summit at which the two leaders could explore cooperation or at least easing outright hostility on the most pressing matters of the day . Wang Yi visit will serve as one of the final touchpoints in laying the groundwork for the Biden Xi meeting , said Ryan Hass , director of the John Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institute , a Washington based think tank . Wang meetings in Washington will set the contours for the topics the two leaders will discuss when they meet in November .

During his stint as Pakistan prime minister , Nawaz Sharif had reached out to India twice : in 1999 during ex PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee Lahore bus trip and the second instance when Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking all the risks went to Pakistan on December 25 , 2015 . But in both the instances , the initiatives were scuttled by the de facto ruler , the Pakistan Army . In 1999 , the Lahore bus initiative was scuttled by the Kargil war and the second one was the terror attack on Pathankot airbase on January 2 , 2016 . Sharif has made the right overture by saying he wants to reach out to India . But the fact is , he needs to get permission from the Pakistan Army before making any new initiative with India . Does Pak Army want to make Nawaz Sharif the PM again ? Pakistan Army is not comfortable making Nawaz Sharif the next prime minister of the country . The veteran leader will add to the votebank of his party . But both the Army and Sharif have an agenda to keep Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf PTI chief Imran Khan , who is in jail , permanently locked up over there and ensure that the cricketer turned politician does not come back to power . Although the Pakistan Army is not comfortable with Sharif as the PM , but it needs the PML N chief to put down Imran Khan . What do Palestine and PoK flags at Lahore rally mean ? During the rally at Minar i Pakistan , Nawaz Sharif said he is going to initiate dialogue with India on Kashmir . India is not interested in any kind of dialogue on Kashmir except on cross border terrorism . After the abrogation of Article 370 and Article , there is nothing left to talk with Islamabad on Kashmir . Sharif is being delusional when he makes such statement that he is going to resolve Kashmir as there is nothing to be resolved . There is peace prevailing in the Kashmir Valley and the region is full of tourists . Right now , Kashmir is not looking at Pakistan for any kind of relief . The chief is just reaching out to his domestic audience like all his predecessors used to do . Neither Nawaz Sharif nor the civilian leadership of Pakistan is important . It is the Pakistan Army which is important and is not at all interested in lowering down cross border terrorism in Kashmir . \" Exciting news !

Biden said Wednesday that he warned Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran supreme leader , that if Tehran continues to move against forces in the Middle East , we will respond . The president disclosure , delivered while standing beside Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the White House Rose Garden , followed reports that nearly two dozen American troops were hurt in waves of attacks involving one way attack drones and rockets on military positions in both Iraq and Syria on 18 . On Thursday , a Pentagon spokesman said at least 12 separate attacks have occurred in Iraq and four more in Syria since 17 . The latest , at the air base near Irbil , Iraq , happened after Biden remarks . Advertisement A senior administration official , who like some others interviewed for this report spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss government calculations , said that nothing has changed about our prerogatives to protect deployed service members , but we also not blind to the fact that there are other forces at work now , and we want to be informed by what else is going on in the region . As the administration has surged combat power and defensive equipment to the Middle East , Republicans in Congress have implored Biden to respond to the attacks . They were joined on Wednesday by retired Joseph Votel , whose final posting , as the head of Central Command , afforded him firsthand insight into Iran support for militia groups throughout the Middle East . Votel , whose reputation as a nonpartisan military commander earned him admirers in Democratic and GOP administrations , said during an online panel discussion that the United States has unfortunately allowed the attacks to become a little bit of a norm by not responding to them uniformly . We will have to do that , Votel said . I think we are at the point where we can probably do that now , and we should . With the additional military assets dispatched to the region , he added , we can and should respond more directly to these threats on our troops . Advertisement Iranian proxies have harassed deployed forces for years , flying self detonating drones into remote outposts and , at times , provoking an American response . That happened in March , when Biden directed retaliatory airstrikes after an American contractor was killed and other personnel were wounded by such an attack in Syria . The president said then that Tehran should be prepared for us to act forcefully to protect our people . The deliberations now are complicated by the 7 cross border rampage in Israel by Hamas militants based in Gaza . The assault killed more than , compelling Israel to declare war . Hamas is part of the broader network receiving training and weapons from Iran , prompting concerns that other heavily armed proxy forces , such as Hezbollah in Lebanon , could join the conflict . Seth Moulton D , an Iraq War veteran , said in an interview that the Middle East is a tinderbox at the moment , putting at odds the administration mandate to protect American troops with its efforts to avoid being drawn into a larger conflict in which forces also could be at risk . Biden and his top advisers , are walking a fine line quite well , he said , but the situation could change at any moment . Advertisement Given the volatility in the region today , I think it unwise for any officials to publicly declare a line in the sand , he said . There are clearly entities in the Middle East that want a war , and we do want to play into that . Senior Pentagon officials this week have warned that they see the prospect for significant escalation against personnel across the Middle East in coming days . The Embassy in Kuwait underscored that point on Wednesday , issuing an alert that said officials were aware of threats made on social media by Alwiyat al Waad al Haq , an Iraq based militia with ties to Iranian backed actors that have claimed numerous attacks against troops . citizens , it stated , are advised to remain alert . Kenneth Frank McKenzie , a retired Marine Corps general who led Central Command from 2019 to 2022 , said the infusion of firepower into the region , including the deployment of two aircraft carrier strike groups and additional air defense units and fighter squadrons , should send a very clear message to Iran . Our posture in the region is getting significantly more powerful every day , and they going to pay attention to that , McKenzie said . Like Votel , McKenzie attributed the rise in attacks on forces in part to the decision not to routinely address earlier incidents . It likely , he added , that Central Command will develop options to do so , and then it will be up to Biden whether and how the United States responds . Advertisement The Iranians tend to push until someone pushes back , McKenzie said . I would think that , at some point , you would want to push back but that not a military decision . He stopped short of echoing Votel call to do so now . With the recent proxy attacks , Iran is testing the United States and looking for vulnerabilities , said Bradley Bowman , senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies . From Tehran perspective , he said , there really no downside to doing so as the United States says that it wants to avoid a broad regional war . Bowman , an Afghanistan war veteran , said one sensible approach might be to launch airstrikes specifically at militias in Syria , to prevent Iranian officials from stirring up domestic politics against the United States in Iraq . There are about 900 American troops in Syria and another in Iraq , with both groups focused on preventing a resurgence of the Islamic State group .',\n",

AMNESTY SAYS ISRAEL ORDER FOR CIVILIANS TO LEAVE NORTHERN GAZA MAY VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL LAW Cairo : Amnesty International said Wednesday that the Israeli army order for residents of northern Gaza to leave may violate international humanitarian law . The Israeli army has been dropping leaflets in Gaza asking Palestinians to flee the northern half of the besieged enclave or risk being identified as accomplices of Hamas . The falling leaflets come around a week after the army first called on around million residents in northern Gaza to leave their homes and head southwards , as it prepares for a ground invasion of the territory . The messages in these leaflets can not be considered an effective warning to civilians , and instead provide further evidence that Israel aims to forcibly displace civilians in northern Gaza , said Donatella Rovera , Amnesty senior crisis response adviser .

              " 'Israel Innovative Sponge Bombs : Unveiling a Unique Tool to Counter Gaza Underground Tunnels Israel is on the verge of introducing a groundbreaking tactical tool , referred to as the sponge bomb , in its ongoing efforts to counteract the complex network of underground tunnels used by Hamas in Gaza . These specialized devices are encased within a protective plastic container featuring a precisely engineered metal barrier that divides two distinct liquids . When the moment arises , a trained soldier activates the sponge bomb , allowing these liquids to merge as it advances towards its intended destination . The Israel Defense Forces IDF have ingeniously designed these sponge bombs to serve a very particular purpose . Unlike traditional explosive devices , they do not inflict harm through explosions . Instead , they work by promptly sealing any gaps or tunnel openings that might be exploited by hostile combatants . Also Read Border situation remains stable : Army Chief Gen Manoj Pande Details concerning the deployment of these enigmatic sponge bombs have been closely guarded by the IDF . Upon activation , they produce a rapid and expanding foam , which swiftly hardens to achieve its desired effect . In the year 2021 , the IDF exhibited the deployment of these ingenious devices during comprehensive training exercises . These exercises involved the creation of a simulated tunnel system at the army base , strategically situated near the Gaza border . The primary aim was to prepare IDF personnel to navigate and counteract the subterranean passages effectively . As the IDF prepares for a forthcoming ground operation , the significance of the challenge becomes apparent . The sprawling labyrinth of tunnels , colloquially known as the Gaza Metro , stretches over hundreds of miles , providing shelter and camouflage to Hamas fighters and their leadership . The sponge bomb is poised to emerge as a vital asset for the IDF . Its capacity to seal off tunnel entrances and prevent surprise attacks is a crucial defensive measure . These specialized devices come stored in a compact plastic container featuring a strategically positioned metal partition , ensuring the two essential liquids remain separate . Only when deployed by a well trained soldier , this partition is removed , allowing the liquids to mix as the bomb is propelled towards its intended target . Also Read Chanakya Defence Dialogue of Indian Army : Strengthening Strategic Insights To address this intricate challenge , the IDF has formed specialized tunnel reconnaissance units within the engineering corps . These units are equipped with an array of cutting edge tools , including ground penetrating radar , both aerial and ground sensors , and advanced drilling systems . Recent reports indicate that IDF personnel have been furnished with specialized equipment to facilitate underground visibility . Given the absence of natural light in the underground environment , troops are now reliant on thermal technology for night vision , supplemented by specially designed radios capable of reliable communication in these challenging conditions . In addition to these measures , Israel is actively exploring the use of drones and robots to navigate the complex tunnel network . However , deploying these technologies underground has posed significant technical challenges . The introduction of the sponge bomb and these highly specialized tools represents a concerted effort by Israel to adapt and respond effectively to the evolving threats posed by underground tunnel networks . These endeavours are part of a broader strategy to ensure the safety and security of Israeli soldiers as they confront the complex and perilous reality of the Gaza Strip .',\n",

Referring to Hamas and the 7 October attacks , he stated that the history of the Palestinian issue is around 80 years and trying to reduce its dimensions to just one attack and just one Palestinian liberation group is a big lie . Abdollahian said , According to the international law and hundreds of resolutions of this very assembly the entire land of Palestine is an occupied land and because of this , the Zionist regime is recognized as an aggressor and an occupier . The Palestinian nation like any other nation under occupation has an indisputable and inherent right of self determination and has the right to directly and freely decide its independence and create an independent government to decide for itself . Palestine , as a nation under occupation has the legitimate right to resist occupation including all available methods including armed struggle . Therefore , the recent hypocritical actions to introduce the struggle as a terrorist action will not deceive the free nation , he added .

Israel continued to strike targets in northern Gaza overnight between Monday and Tuesday , as the war between Israel and Hamas entered the eighteenth day of fighting . According to a statement from the IDF provided to media , over 400 targets were struck in Gaza and several Hamas commanders were killed .

              " 'Israel Hamas war : Will attack on US bases by Iran proxies in Syria widen West Asia conflict ? A number of drone attacks on US bases in Syria and Iraq , coming in the backdrop of the Israel Hamas war , are raising fears about a war breaking out across the region . According to the Pentagon , 21 servicemen have reported minor injuries and one civilian contractor died of a heart attack in attacks from Iran backed groups that began on 17 October . On Friday , the US hit back by striking weapons and ammunition facilities in Syria used by Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps and militia groups after an order from President Joe Biden . Let take a closer look at how tensions are raising fears of war breaking out in the region . What happened ? Iran backed groups are continuously attacking US and coalition troops in Iraq and Syria . The White House on Monday said the US had recorded an uptick in rocket and drone attacks by Iranian backed proxy groups against military bases housing US personnel in Iraq and Syria . It added that it is deeply concerned about the potential for any significant escalation of these attacks in the days ahead . Iran backs a number of outfits in the region including Islamic Jihad , Hamas , and Hezbollah . According to Reuters , there have been at least 19 attacks on bases . NBC News quoted Pentagon press secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder as saying the strikes were a mix of one way attack drones and rockets . The 21 US military personnel suffered minor injuries , but all have since returned to duty . Time Magazine reported that the Islamic Resistance in Iraq put up a number of videos on Telegram of drones flying into the desert sky . The videos are accompanied by texts that warn of more strikes and asking the public to keep away from military bases . While the outlet could not confirm the veracity of the videos , it cited metadata as showing that the videos matched the days when US bases were attacked . While the Pentagon has no proof Iran directly ordered the attacks , a senior official told Time Magazine , It fair to say when you see this uptick in activity and attacks by many of these groups , there Iranian fingerprints all over it . While the number of groups backed by Iran in the region remains unclear , Time Magazine quoted experts as saying it falls between 10 and 20 . There at least 10 or 20 , if not many more groups between the Iraq Syria border alone , Behnam Ben Taleblu , an Iran expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , told the outlet . A source told CNN that Tehran influence over the groups can not be denied but that whether these groups are acting on their own remains an open question . The US , which has backed Israel but called for humanitarian aid for Gaza , has warned of more strikes if the Iran backed groups do halt their attacks . Unacceptable and must stop The US air strikes took place at roughly am on Friday near Abu Kamal , a Syrian town on the border with Iraq , and were carried out by two fighter jets using precision munitions , a US defence official said . These precision self defence strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against US personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups that began on 17 October , US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement . These Iranian backed attacks against US forces are unacceptable and must stop , Austin said . Biden has sent a rare message to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning Tehran against targeting US personnel in West Asia , the White House said earlier on Thursday . My warning to the ayatollah was that if they continue to move against those troops , we will respond , and he should be prepared , Biden was quoted as saying by Al Jazeera . The US president added that it has nothing to do with Israel . There was a direct message relayed . That as far as I going to go , US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters , declining to say how it was delivered . What we want is for Iran to take very specific actions , to direct its militias and proxies to stand down , a senior US defence official said . The United States did not coordinate the air strikes with Israel , the official added . Austin also sought to distance the strikes against facilities used by the IRGC in Syria from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas members in Gaza . These narrowly tailored strikes in self defence were intended solely to protect and defend US personnel in Iraq and Syria , he said . They are separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas , and do not constitute a shift in our approach to the Israel Hamas conflict , he added . The United States has sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region over the last three weeks . On Thursday the Pentagon said about 900 more US troops have arrived in West Asia or are heading there to bolster air defences for US personnel . Iran , meanwhile , has said it can not stand idly by while Israel bombs Gaza . Iran foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned at the United Nations on Thursday that if Israel retaliation against Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip does end then the United States will not be spared from this fire . CNN quoted Amirabdollahian as saying that the region is currently a powder keg . Any miscalculation in continuing genocide and forced displacement can have serious and bitter consequences , both in the region and for the warmongers , Abdollahian warned . If crimes against humanity do not stop immediately , there is the possibility at any moment that the region will go out of control , he added . What do experts say ? That Washington is walking a tightrope . Speaking to The Guardian , Charles Lister , director of the Syria and countering terrorism and extremism programmes at Washington Middle East Institute said : The US has now had two dozen soldiers injured . In any other conditions it would have responded but its hands are tied because it does not want to be blamed for escalating . The US government is very concerned that we are walking into a regional crisis . The attacks show that Iran has an extensive network of well armed , aggressive and well coordinated proxies across the region which it has established for exactly this scenario . They are currently testing redlines but not pushing too hard . They are putting the onus on the US to respond . Tobias Borck , a senior research fellow in Middle East security studies at London Royal United Services Institute , warned that Iran was literally playing with fire . What we are seeing is the next level out from the Gazan war . This is all carefully calibrated to show solidarity . Iran is saying : we see the aircraft carriers but we are not scared and we can hurt you too . It is incredibly dangerous , Borck added . A lot of people want to understand it as Tehran pulling the strings but actually these are partners who share a worldview and ideology . One element is claiming the mantle of leading the opposition to a western imposed order in the region . Afshon Ostovar , an associate professor at the Naval Postgraduate School , told Time Magazine , You do launch rockets and missiles and armed drones into populated areas such as bases without a willingness to kill . And if you going to commit lethal attacks , the escalatory ladder or dynamic that follows is never a sure thing . Ryder warned that things might get worse . What we are seeing is the prospect for more significant escalation against US forces and personnel across the region in the very near term coming from Iranian proxy forces , and ultimately from Iran , Ryder was quoted as saying by NBC News . We always reserve the right to defend ourselves and we will never hesitate to take action when needed to protect our forces and our interests overseas , he added . With inputs from agencies',\n",

Wang will visit Washington from 26 28 and meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Joe Biden National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan , officials said , declining to say if he will meet with Biden as well .

It is also the long awaited reciprocal visit after several top officials including Blinken visited Beijing this summer . Also Read , China pledge to improve relations , resume high level talks after Blinken visit Washington top priority has been to ensure the intense competition between the world two largest economies and their disagreements over a host of issues from trade to Taiwan and the South China Sea does not veer into conflict . \" We continue to believe that direct face to face diplomacy is the best way to raise challenging issues , address misperception and miscommunication , and explore working with the Chinese where our interests intersect , \" said one official , who briefed reporters on the trip on condition of anonymity . The visit also comes as Hamas 7 attacks and Israel response dominate global headlines , even as Russia war in Ukraine grinds on . Washington is sending military aid to Israel and Ukraine , while Beijing has grown closer to Russia since the Ukraine war began and has called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas .

              " 'Strikes Iranian Linked Targets in Syria The United States carried out two airstrikes against facilities used by Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and its proxies in eastern Syria early Friday in retaliation for a flurry of recent rocket and drone attacks against American forces in Iraq and Syria . The strikes by Air Force jets , against a weapons storage facility and an ammunition storage facility , were intended to send a strong signal to Iran to rein in the attacks the Biden administration has blamed on Tehran proxies in Syria and Iraq without escalating the conflict in the Middle East , officials said . The targets , while limited in number , represent an escalation in striking facilities used by Iran own forces in the region , not just the militias in Iraq and Syria that Tehran helps to arm , train and equip . These precision self defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin III said in a statement . The United States does not seek conflict and has no intention nor desire to engage in further hostilities , but these Iranian backed attacks against forces are unacceptable and must stop , Austin said . Since Hamas surprise attack against Israel on 7 , President Biden and his aides have sought to contain the war between Israel and Hamas , and prevent it from spilling over into a regional conflict with Iran and its proxies in Lebanon , Syria and Iraq . To that end , the United States has deployed two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean near Israel and dozens of additional warplanes to the Persian Gulf region to deter Iran and its proxies in Lebanon , Syria and Iraq from engaging in a regional war . The Pentagon has also rushed additional Patriot antimissile batteries and other air defenses to several Gulf nations to protect troops and bases in the region . But with the near daily attacks against forces over the past 10 days the Pentagon tally climbed to at least 19 by late Thursday pressure had been mounting on the United States to respond militarily .',\n",

He is currently taking shelter in his home next to the MSF office in Gaza City with his family and children . Today , Loay , like many others , is without food , water or electricity . He shares in his own words the desperate situation on the ground . The situation here is very difficult . We do not have electricity , water , or Internet . There is no safe place here and the situation is extremely difficult : no safety , no bread , no water , and no electricity since the beginning of the war up until now . God help us in this difficult time . At this moment , we do not have any drinkable water ; the water we have is polluted and not safe to drink . We do even have fuel to pump the water wells . Our families are going through very difficult times . There is no safe place amid the bombings . Our families and kids are being displaced from the north to the south and from the south to anywhere else . We do not have any safe place to stay . We delivered medical supplies to Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City two days ago . The movement to the hospital was very tough , we saw hundreds of people taking shelter inside the hospital and it was difficult to walk inside . It took us a lot of time to deliver the supplies . There were huge numbers of people inside the hospital ; they think the hospital is a safe place , but there is no safe place . The majority of the injuries are very critical . There is not enough space . There are some patients who need surgeries , and they are laying on the ground due to the high number of people in the hospital . I decided to stay in my home because there is no safe place in Gaza . My house is close to the MSF office and clinic . The majority of my family decided to move to the centre of Gaza and to the south . A large number of the people who moved to the south are returning now to their homes , because they have suffered a lot being homeless . Again : no electricity , no water and the situation is extremely tense for people in the south . I am still working on a daily basis in the burn clinic with MSF . We still receive some patients with burns . I do the dressings for them . It is difficult for them to come back again so I prepare kits for them and I show them on how to do it themselves . This is at least something I can help with as a nurse . About MSF in Palestine The information about our response , below , is correct as of 26 , 2023 MSF activities in Gaza are currently very limited . We have extreme difficulties delivering aid and providing healthcare due to the insecurity and the unpredictability of the bombardments . While some of our colleagues decided to move south following the unacceptable evacuation order of north Gaza , some of our other colleagues have remained in northern Gaza and continue to support in lifesaving activities in Al Shifa Hospital as well in Al Nasser hospital in the south . In Al Awda hospital , a team of seven MSF staff is also working in the MSF inpatient department . We are also supporting local health authorities with donations from our medical stock . Due to the huge and uninterrupted influx of wounded people since the beginning of the current active conflict , Al Shifa Hospital , the main surgical facility in the Gaza strip , was on the brink of a complete shortage of essential medicines . In response , we recently were finally able to make a large donation of medical stock , including medicines and medical equipment to Al Shifa hospital . Our staff are working hard on preparing medical and humanitarian supplies to be sent to Gaza when safe access will be guaranteed and open , and we send in emergency teams if and when we able to . MSF is committed to supporting the people affected by the Israeli heavy bombardments and indiscriminate attacks on Gaza . We stand in solidarity with healthcare workers and patients in Gaza . We want to be able to access people in need of medical care and offer lifesaving humanitarian services , but to do this we need basic guarantees of safety . The West Bank Since the start of the current conflict , our teams in Hebron , Nablus and Jenin have been actively assessing the medical needs in the West Bank , as violence there is escalating .

Some 220 people more than half of whom are foreign nationals are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza . Israel responded with heavy aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip , which according to the Hamas run Health Ministry has left at least Gazans dead including children . Gazans have been wounded since the start of the war . A slow trickle of humanitarian aid has entered the Strip in recent days , after Israel imposed a siege on the enclave , cutting electricity , water and fuel . Here what you need to know : The release of a large number of hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza may happen within a few days , according to Israeli and foreign sources familiar with negotiations on the matter . One of the sources said that the parties hope to finalize the deal \" within two days , maybe even less , \" and that whether it comes to pass depends on progress in negotiations with Hamas . House Speaker Mike Johnson said the first bill he will bring to the floor is a resolution \" in support of our dear friend Israel and we are overdue in getting that done . \" Nearly 400 lawmakers co sponsored a resolution condemning the Hamas attack in the immediate aftermath of October 7 , condemning \" the barbaric war launched by Hamas \" and calling on all countries to condemn the organization . It further calls upon Hamas to cease its attacks , release hostages and return bodies of the deceased , as well as avowing continued commitment to maintaining aid , enforcing the Taylor Force Act and urging the full enforcement of sanctions against Iran .

The World Health Organization is \" gravely concerned \" about the condition of Israeli hostages captured by Hamas during the October 7 attack , calling for their immediate release and urgent access to each of them and delivery of medical care . \" There is an urgent need for the captors of the hostages to provide signs of life , proof of provision of health care and the immediate release , on humanitarian and health grounds , of all those abducted , \" said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus . Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Wednesday that Israel conflict with Hamas could spread well beyond the Middle East and said it was wrong that innocent women , children and old people in Gaza were being punished for other people crimes . Putin , who made the comments in a Kremlin meeting with Russian religious leaders of different faiths , said bloodshed in the region had to stop . He said he told other world leaders in phone calls that if it did not , there was a risk of a much wider conflagration . Putin said : \" Our task today , our main task , is to stop the bloodshed and violence , \" said Putin , according to a Kremlin transcript of the meeting Otherwise , further escalation of the crisis is fraught with grave and extremely dangerous and destructive consequences .

A day after Israel top diplomat hit out at UN chief Antonio Guterres , the Palestinian Authority which exercises partial civil control over the West Bank and is led by President Mahmoud Abbas 87 issued a statement accusing Israel of attempting to undermine and neutralise the world body . New Delhi : The Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority are locking horns about the role of the United Nations UN in the escalating conflict in Gaza , with one side denouncing the international organisation and the other supporting its efforts to facilitate cessation of hostilities . It is also seen as a new Israeli attempt to neutralise the role of the United Nations particularly the neutralisation of the role of the Secretary General of the United Nations in his capacity and his consistent positions with international law , it added . The grievances of the Palestinian people can not justify the horrific attacks by Hamas . Those horrendous attacks can not justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people . António Guterres October 25 , 2023 A high level session of the UN Security Council was held Tuesday , during which Israel Foreign Minister Eli Cohen dismissed calls for proportionality in the country response to Hamas attack on 7 October while the Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyadh al Maliki demanded an end to the fighting . The UN Secretary General , meanwhile , alleged violations of international law in Gaza and noted that the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum . This drew a sharp response from Israel foreign minister who asked Guterres : Mr Secretary General , in what world do you live ? Shortly after , Israel Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan who was detained briefly last month after protesting during Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi address at the UN General Assembly UNGA called for Guterres resignation . The UN Secretary General , who shows understanding for the campaign of mass murder of children , women , and the elderly , is not fit to lead the UN . I call on him to resign immediately , Erdan wrote on He added that there is no point in speaking to people who show compassion for the most terrible atrocities .

While the world body and voices from Europe including EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell have repeatedly called for a temporary halt to the fighting , Israel and the US have rejected such calls . Israel argues that it has every right to defend itself while the US worries a ceasefire would benefit Hamas . A halt in fighting would give Hamas the ability to rest , to refit and to get ready to continue launching terrorist attacks against Israel , US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Monday . At the special meeting at the UNSC , US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Washington draft resolution to the UN , proposed last Saturday , will build on many points proposed by Brazil resolution last week . Notably , the US had vetoed that resolution . Twelve other council members voted in favour , including two permanent members China and France while the UK and Russia abstained . In his remarks Tuesday , Blinken argued that acts of terrorism must be denounced whether they target people in Nairobi or Mumbai , citing ISIS , Lashkar e Taiba LeT and Hamas as examples of terror groups . The US proposed resolution makes four points : the right of countries to defend themselves against terrorism , protections of civilians , preventing the conflict from spreading and the need for an enduring political solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians . A vote on the draft resolution is expected to be held this week . First , to recognize the right of any nation to defend themselves against terrorism . Second , to protect civilians . Third , to prevent the conflict from spreading . Fourth , to build an enduring political solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians . Matthew Miller October 24 , 2023 Blinken did not mention the word ceasefire in his remarks . Reports also say that the Arab League objected to many points in the US draft resolution . Speaking to Ahram Online earlier this week , the Arab League Permanent Representative to the UN , Ambassador Majed Abdul Fattah , said member countries objected to the lack of a clear call for an immediate ceasefire and the classification of Hamas as a terror group .

              " 'A historian account : How conditions in war torn Palestine led to the rise of Hamas The wide slivers of plastic snap in the invisible wind that whistles through a long corridor closed off by slabs of cement eight meters high . Slivers of plastic and slabs of cement at Erez are the funerary monument of the Oslo Accords and of an ideal of economic development that had once seemed to be emerging over the horizon . This ideal had been realised in those Israeli industrial zones that had arisen in border areas , where Palestinians arrived from Gaza in the morning , provided cheap labour , then returned to the Strip in the evening . Then , when the conflict became even harsher at the outbreak of the Second Intifada , queues of Palestinians in ever dwindling numbers began to appear throughout the long Erez corridor along the northern border between Gaza and Israel . In the unreal silence of the Erez dawn , one can nearly hear the footsteps of those workers , a black plastic bag in their hand with their food from home . All lined up , like legions , hundreds , thousands , waiting to pass through the Israeli military checkpoints at the border . Now there is no one left in this corridor . Even the plastic and cement has disappeared : by 2010 , in one of the seemingly never ending aesthetic changes to the Erez crossing , the 200 meter long corridor has transformed into a path edged by a metal net and a corrugated iron roof . Despite the changes , the silence remains the same . At Erez , silence is amplified from the other side of the wall that separates Gaza from Israel by the improbably high ceilings of the enormous terminal that lies alone as though it is some kind of exhibition : a beautiful terminal , styled like an airport , and completely empty . As fate would have it , the terminal was completed after the dream of a transborder industrial zone had already been shattered by the failure of the Oslo process , by the Second Intifada , and by terrorism . All that remains of that pained humanity that crossed the border to earn its daily keep are the snapshots taken by photographers for the agencies . Not even the few remaining porters , often little more than boys , can break the stony silence of Erez . Without words , they help the few Palestinians who try to cross : the sick with their applications to be hospitalised beyond the border , the employees of international organisations on missions to Israel , and a few businessmen with special permits . They are the ones who belong to the select few special categories , the only Palestinians who have the good fortune of being able to leave Gaza . Ever since the summer of 2005 , when the Israeli pullout from the area crystallised the frontier with Israel to the north and west , no one else has been allowed to leave the Strip . The roughly settlers who used to live in Gaza who , thanks to Tel Aviv good offices , had established three settlement blocs in the Strip are no longer there . Before falling into a coma , then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had made the most momentous political decision since the Israeli pullout from southern Lebanon in 2000 by also withdrawing from Gaza , again unilaterally . Hamas electoral victory of January 25 , 2006 , came a few short months after this unprecedented change , after Sharon had ordered the end of the Israeli presence in the Strip . And it was precisely in Gaza that Hamas had its stronghold . Hamas strength was one of the most important reasons given for the quarantine under which Israel increasingly placed Gaza until , in June 2007 in the move that would bring Hamas to power in the Strip Gaza was completely sealed off from the rest of the world . But even in previous years , the number of Palestinians who could manage to get work permits in Israel had been steadily decreasing to the point of disappearing entirely , while an authorisation to attend a university outside the Strip whether in Egypt , in the United States , in Jordan , or in Europe has always been considered a lottery prize , one to be claimed by only a few lucky ones among the thousands who graduate each year . A few others earn their keep working as porters at Erez . They work for years and years , and they wait for ever fewer customers , most of them severely sick Palestinians who received a permit from the Israeli authorities after passing through a long procedure . The porters help elderly women and mothers with sick children , accepting a few shekels to physically transport them on wrecked luggage trolleys . The porters who lived through the still ongoing changes at Erez greet the few rare guests who arrive from the other side of the wall : VIPs , journalists , nongovernmental organisation NGO volunteers , diplomats , spies all high risk specialists , the only ones who care about the destiny of a place so distant from the daily life of the rest of the world . From the few experts who still pass through Erez , the young porters hope that apart from some loose change , they get a few cigarettes one of the most expensive goods in the Strip , under the increasingly strict isolation imposed by the Israeli army and economy . Welcome to Gaza . Welcome to one of the most desperate places on the planet even well before Hamas rise to power . The records only half describe Gaza predicament : the highest population density in the world , the most consistent demographic increase in the region with over five children per woman , and since the second half of 2008 , the unfortunate distinction of the highest unemployment level on the planet . A smack in the face , squarely delivered when the sun , sand , and dust break the desolation of Erez long corridor . Off to the right , the empty shells of buildings destroyed by the Israelis for security reasons appear , destroyed so that the military control might extend a few kilometres in from the wall at Erez , up to the buildings funded by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan , the old ruler of the Emirates who passed away in November 2004 at virtually the same time as Yasser Arafat . A solitary red flag used to fly here at least until the end of 2007 above the ghostly shell of rooms and pillars , atop the steel skeletons of the destroyed buildings of the broken industrial dream that was Erez : neither the green flag of Hamas nor the historical yellow flag of Fatah , but the adventurous banner of the PFLP , the reds of the Palestinian political arena , their banner flying and ready to take on the Israeli army guns all by themselves . That red flag , borne up by the wind , did last long . Just a few months and it disappeared . And along with it , the last building next to the wall that marked the border , completely flattened in order to allow the Israeli army a perfect view . All that remains now , immutable , is the rhythm of Erez clicking along . Godot silence , the silence of those who wait in fear for something to come along to break the monotony of desolation : tanks entering the olive groves of Beit Hanoun , a Qassam rocket launched toward the towns of the Negev , there , just beyond the border , and the Israeli Air Force missiles ready for targeted assassination . Or an entirely different situation , like the massive attack code named Hot Winter , which took place over the space of barely six days between February and March 2008 . The incursion resulted in 130 dead and 350 wounded among Palestinians , as well as two dead Israeli soldiers who had penetrated just over the horizon of Erez under tank and air cover into that selfsame Beit Hanoun of Sheikh Zayed buildings , and a little farther down into Jabalia , once a refugee camp and now a populous town . It was said at the time that the operation was a response to the Qassam rockets , and to the more sophisticated Grad , which had been launched toward cities in southern Israel . And the rockets , in turn , were often launched as reprisals for a targeted assassination carried out not just in Gaza , but also in the West Bank , to demonstrate that at least as far as the armed factions were concerned , the two Palestinian entities were still united . A few days closure , with hell breaking loose next door . A few days during which that paradoxical silence and everyday routine are broken in a way that only low intensity conflict can break them . It is in these moments that Erez changes , if only for a few days , before once again closing that doorway into hell , replacing Charon sunken eyes with the tired face of a taxi driver , who drives you to Gaza new reality : Hamas political and administrative control of the tiny Palestinian strip along the Mediterranean coast . As time passes , Hamas power becomes more stable , as can be seen in the thorough , polite yet lengthy check of the visitors done by the newly appointed Islamist government bureaucracy at the new gate a few hundred meters from Erez : a few border offices , policemen , and uniformed personnel carrying laptops with webcams to register the newcomer name , passport , and face .

              " 'Blasts Strike Two Egyptian Red Sea Towns UN General Assembly to Vote on New Gaza Immediate Ceasefire Draft at Security Council President of the UN General Assembly , Dennis Francis , delivers a speech in the General Hall AP The UN General Assembly is expected to vote Friday on a draft resolution submitted by the Arab group to demand an \" immediate and unconditional ceasefire \" in Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid to more than two million civilians in the enclave , predicted diplomats . The ten non permanent members of the Security Council began preparing a draft resolution concerning the war after the most powerful UN body charged with maintaining international peace and security failed to take an effective position . Despite 20 days of war and thousands of deaths and injuries , diplomats sought to use all available means to intervene . Jordan has tabled a draft resolution to be voted on at the Emergency Special Session ESS on behalf of the Arab Group . The draft text calls for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access . Palestinian delegate Riyad Mansour announced on Wednesday that the General Assembly is expected to vote on the draft resolution on Friday afternoon , hoping it would allow the General Assembly to work while the Security Council remains paralyzed . The Security Council failed again Wednesday to address the Israeli Hamas war in Gaza , rejecting the US and Russian resolutions . The council is the UN most powerful body , charged with maintaining international peace and security , but its divisions have left it impotent and scrambling to find a resolution with acceptable language . The resolution prepared by the US , Israel closest ally , would stress Israel right to self defense , urge respect for international laws , and call for humanitarian pauses to deliver aid to Gaza . On Wednesday evening , Russia and China used their veto power against the US project , knowing it received support from ten countries . The UAE rejected the resolution , while Brazil and Mozambique abstained . The Russian draft resolution , which was also put to a vote , called for an \" immediate humanitarian ceasefire \" and unequivocally condemns the attacks of 7 and the \" indiscriminate attacks \" on civilians and civilian targets in Gaza . In that vote , four countries voted in favor Russia , China , the UAE , and Gabon . The United States and the UK voted against it , and nine countries abstained . The resolution was adopted because it failed to get the minimum nine \" yes \" votes . The failure of the two resolutions followed the council rejections last week of a Russian resolution that did mention Hamas and also failed to get nine \" yes \" votes and a widely supported Brazilian resolution vetoed by the US that would have condemned the Hamas attacks and all violence against civilians and called for \" humanitarian pauses . \" Russia UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia justified the veto by saying that the US draft resolution could be interpreted as the Security Council support for Israel plans to start a ground operation in Gaza . Nebenzia warned that Israel prospective forceful operation in Gaza carried out in the current manner and with gross violations of human laws and massive loss of civilian life , risks provoking a larger conflict that could encompass the entire region and even go beyond its borders . Whereas the Chinese delegate Zhang Jun said the US draft resolution was \" out of balance \" and \" deeply divisive \" on the urgent issue of ending the fighting . He called it \" evasive on the most urgent issue of ending the fighting , \" saying it does not reflect the world strongest calls for a ceasefire or an end to the fighting and does not help resolve the issue . \" At this moment , ceasefire is not just a diplomatic term . It means the life and death of many civilians . \" After the double veto , the US ambassador , Linda Thomas Greenfield , told the 15 member council that Washington was deeply disappointed that Russia and China vetoed this resolution . \" Though today vote was a setback , we must not be deterred . \" Also , US representative Robert Wood said that the \" bad faith resolution \" put forward by Russia lacked consensus and failed to reflect realities on the ground . \" It was regrettable that Moscow chose to further divide the Council rather than address the needs of Israel and Palestine , \" he added . British delegate Barbara Woodward said the US draft would have had a tangible impact on the ground by calling for humanitarian pauses and the hostages release . She added that the British delegation voted against Russia text as it failed to recognize Israel right to self defense . The deep divisions in the Security Council caused frustration among several diplomats . A diplomat said France tried vainly to persuade Russia and the US to withdraw their texts before referring them to a vote . Meanwhile , the UAE Ambassador , Lana Nusseibeh , said the UN and humanitarian organizations have made clear that what is essential is a humanitarian ceasefire , the release of all hostages , and sustained humanitarian access to Gaza . Nusseibeh said there were \" dozens of statements imploring this council to assign the same value to Palestinian life as it does to Israeli life , \" adding : \" We can not allow any equivocation on this point . \" In response , Israel UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan thanked the US and other nations that supported its resolution for condemning \" savage genocidal terrorists while standing up for the values of freedom and security . \" He denounced those who voted against the resolution , saying they showed the world the Security Council is incapable of condemning \" terrorists and can not confirm the right to self defense of the victim of these heinous crimes . \" After the failure of the US and Russian drafts , Malta UN Ambassador Vanessa Frazier , speaking on behalf of the ten elected council members serving two year terms , announced they would be working on a new proposal in the coming days . \" As elected members of this council , we also represent the rest of the international community , and we have a duty and an obligation to act , \" Frazier told the council . \" There is no time to waste . \"',\n",

His anxiety comes in the wake of ongoing action described by the Yogi Adityanath led government in Uttar Pradesh as a crackdown on those supporting Palestine amid the ongoing Israel Hamas conflict in West Asia . Jameel has stopped writing on social media platforms about the Palestine crisis despite having so many thoughts in his mind . He writes and deletes but does not dare to post in support of Palestine out of fear as the UP Chief Minister has directed police to take strict action against anyone attempting to make \" inciteful \" statements either on social media or from places of worship . \" A few years back , we saw a lockdown in the wake of COVID . The government is putting a similar ban on our pens and minds . We can not write what we see with our own eyes or what we think . We do feel that we are free citizens of a free country anymore , \" Jameel told NewsClick . Recalling the UP Police crackdown on the anti Citizenship Amendment Act CAA and the proposed pan India National Register of Citizens NRC in which at least media 23 Muslims died across the state , he said , \" One of my friends was arrested and sent to jail for three days for sharing a post of mine on social media condemning CAA and NRC as being against the Indian tradition of inclusiveness and idea of a pluralist democracy . He spent his salary of nearly a year in legal expenses . \" Shadab , a Muslim police official , also lives in constant fear after a constable was suspended for allegedly sharing a post supporting Palestine on social media . \" I do write anything on social media , but I share videos and photos I like . However , videos coming from Gaza are heart wrenching . Hundreds of people died in the horrific airstrike by Israel . I wanted to share those videos of how cruel Israel is taking innocent lives , but due to fear of legal action , I am not sharing anything . In fact , I stopped using the internet . Our colleagues are keeping tabs on our social media and what we Muslims are writing sharing on social sites , \" he said . Suhail Ansari , a constable who was posted in the Lakhimpur Kheri district , was suspended , and a departmental enquiry was initiated against him for allegedly sharing posts in support of Palestine . According to the police , he had launched a drive on social media to collect funds to help Palestine . Ansari , a resident of Bareilly , posted on his Facebook account , according to the police . \" Help Save Palestine . I All Donations Are Directly Sent To Add To Story To Help Save Palestine , \" the post reads . Talking to media persons , Kheri deputy superintendent of police Sandeep Singh , who is posted as circle officer city there , said an additional superintendent of police rank officer was inquiring about the constable and his inclination as well as supportive posts for Palestine on social media . He said the inquiry was probing all aspects , and stern action could be taken against him if he is found the culprit . However , the Ansari family refuted the allegation of collecting funds for Palestine . \" Suhail did not write anything in support of Palestine but shared a forwarded message that sharing posts will credit one dollar to Palestinians . What is crime in this ? Everyday people keep sharing forward messages on social media , but no action is taken against them , \" a relative told NewsClick . In a similar case , the police registered a case against an unidentified youth in Bareilly district who had posted pictures of aerial bombings on Gaza . Adityanath has warned of strict action against anyone indulging in activities that oppose the Indian government stand on the ongoing Israel Hamas conflict and voicing support for Palestine on social media . The directive came close on the heels of a pro Palestine march in support of Palestinians held in Aligarh Muslim University AMU campus last week . Meanwhile , several Muslim youths and clerics have been detained for their posts on Palestine . A Muslim cleric was arrested in Uttar Pradesh Hamirpur for posting content in support of Palestine on social media . The accused has been identified as 23 year old Suhail Ansari . The police on Friday booked Ansari and another cleric named Atif Chowdhary under Indian Penal Code Sections promoting enmity between two groups and statements creating or promoting enmity , hatred or ill will between classes in the case . The police are conducting raids to take Chowdhary into custody . A doctor identified as Parmendra Maheshwari has also been booked in Bareilly for allegedly making objectionable comments against Muslims on WhatsApp after the Israel Hamas war broke out . Maheshwari has been charged under Indian Penal Code Sections promoting enmity between two groups and deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs . He has not been arrested yet . Resentment Over Police Crackdown on AMU Students The Aligarh Muslim University AMU campus witnessed uneasy calm as hundreds of security personnel guarded the main gate of the varsity . Throughout the day , the campus streets bore silence , while students completely avoided writing anything related to Palestine . Resentment is brewing among students soon after four students were booked for participating in a protest march on the university campus to express solidarity with Palestinians . Aligarh police registered a case at Civil Lines police station against the four students mentioned in the first information report FIR . On October 8 , approximately 100 students gathered at Duck Point in the AMU campus for the march . They proceeded to march to the main gate or Bab e Syed gate of AMU , chanting slogans in support of Palestinians and condemning Israel for its \" dominance and atrocities against civilians \" . Both the university and district administration said that the protest march was held without the required permission for such activities on the university campus . According to the FIR seen by NewsClick , a case has been filed under Sections promoting enmity among different groups , 188 disobedience to orders promulgated by a public servant , and Section 505 statements conducing to public mischief of the Indian Penal Code IPC . Commenting over the ongoing situation , Sarfraz Nazeer , a lawyer in Siddharthnagar , told NewsClick , \" When the Ministry of External Affairs supported the establishment of a sovereign , independent and viable state of Palestine , why is the state government taking action against its citizens ? The reason people are afraid of writing on social media is that police first book for post , and then they call for interrogation . In the name of interrogation , they run from police station to court , and nobody wants to run from pillar to post for merely sharing a post on social media . \"',\n",

              " 'UNSC rejection of Gaza resolution double oppression against Palestinians : Iran president Iranian President Ebrahim Raeisi says the US veto of a UN Security Council resolution calling for a pause in Israel attacks and crimes against the people of Gaza is double oppression against the Palestinians and humanity . The ongoing events against the oppressed people of Palestine in Gaza belie West claims about advocating civilization , freedom and human rights , Raeisi said on Thursday while addressing a meeting in Tehran to honor great achievements of the country health sector . The president described the incidents in Gaza as heart wrenching , which aroused anger and hatred of people across the globe towards the US and the Israeli regime . Pointing to injustices practiced by the global arrogant system , Raeisi said the US blocked a United Nations Security Council draft resolution calling for a humanitarian pause in the crimes perpetrated against the oppressed people of Gaza who have been either forced to flee their houses or their houses have been razed to the ground as a result of Israel airstrikes . The US on Wednesday vetoed the resolution that had been drafted by Brazil and had sought to broker aid access to Gaza amid the incessant Israeli airstrikes and shelling against people in the tiny strip of land . Representatives of 12 countries in the 15 member UNSC voted in favor of the resolution while Britain and Russia abstained . A UNSC resolution needs the approval of all five veto wielding members of the body , including the US , to pass . Besides , for the resolution to pass , no permanent member should cast a veto . US Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield justified her country veto , saying this resolution did not mention Israel right of self defense . The Iranian president emphasized that the US , Israel and their supporters are committing genocide and crimes against humanity in Gaza . We believe that the blood of the oppressed Palestinian martyrs will definitely shatter the current world order and will establish a just system in the world , Raeisi stated . He noted that nations in the Muslim world and across the globe are currently witnessing heinous crimes by arrogant powers against the oppressed Palestinian people in Gaza . He said nations across the globe are enraged by the current unjust world order , describing the ongoing oppression against women and children in Gaza as a testimony of it . Nearly people have been killed in more than 11 days of Israeli attacks on Gaza . The brutal campaign began after the Gaza based Hamas resistance movement launched attacks on Israeli settlers and military forces on October 7 to retaliate months of violence against the Palestinians and their sanctities . The US has always been a staunch supporter of Israel . Washington has been supporting the regime by blocking international efforts to hold the regime accountable for its acts . The UNSC resolution vetoed by the US on Wednesday had called for the cancellation of an order for civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate to south of the coastal sliver in anticipation of a major ground offensive by Israel . More than a million have become homeless inside Gaza as a result of Israeli bombardment and shelling . The regime has also maintained a crippling siege on the small territory by cutting water , electricity and food supplies to more than million people living there .',\n",

              " 'How can I vote for Biden ? Arab Americans in Michigan betrayed by Israel support Leading up to the 2020 election , Arab American organizers in south east Michigan like Terry Ahwal worked to convince their community to go to the polls for Joe Biden . The message was simple : Donald Trump Islamophobic rhetoric and policies such as the Middle East travel ban were a threat to Arab Americans . Voters mobilized to help push Biden over the top in this critical swing state . Several years on , amid Biden full throated support of Israel in the current war and an unfolding humanitarian crisis that has claimed thousand of lives in Gaza , Ahwal feels deep regret : I have to say I sorry to my friends . Ahwal is among hundreds of thousands of Arab Americans in Michigan , many of whom are watching with horror as the US supports Israel as it carries out its bombing campaign . After the community backed Biden by a wide margin in November 2020 , the feeling goes beyond betrayal , about a dozen Arab Americans in Michigan said . This is a complete loss of humanity , it is the active support of a genocide , and I do think it gets any worse than that , said Huwaida Arraf , a Palestinian American activist and attorney . I gotten a few comments , Well , the GOP is going to be worse , and my question is : How can you get worse than active support of a genocide ? Polls show that Americans have generally been supportive of Israel and its response to the 7 October attack , though Morning Consult data released this week also shows the number of people who sympathize equally with Israelis and Palestinians is on the rise . That poll also showed support for Biden response is growing . But Arab Americans who spoke with the Guardian said they did not know of anyone in their community who would vote for Biden in 2024 . That could have profound consequences in a state in which Trump won by votes in 2016 , and a tight rematch is taking shape . Still , the Biden administration has remained steadfastly supportive of Israel , proposing in aid ; providing weapons such as missiles and armored personnel carriers ; refusing calls for a ceasefire ; and deploying US troops to the region . A Data for Progress poll released Thursday found 66 of Americans think the US should call for a ceasefire . The use of Arab American tax dollars to bomb Gaza is generating widespread horror and fury , Arraf said . Though Biden has called on Israel to show restraint and touted a deal he struck to allow trucks carrying aid to enter Gaza , Arab Americans who spoke with the Guardian view the gestures as pittances . They see the US support as ham fisted and shocking in the context of the last presidential election . Even our conservative members voted for Biden , only to get a guy who dehumanizes us , who is sending the weapons to Israel , and the only purpose of these weapons is to use Palestinian as target practice , Ahwal said . I do know anybody who would vote for him . That sentiment was echoed by Muslim and Arab Americans elsewhere in the country . Zohran Mamdani , a New York assemblymember , called Biden response to the crisis disgusting and warned that the president is underestimating the Arab American voting bloc . I have had many constituents of mine , as well as Muslims from beyond my district , reach out to me and ask me : How am I supposed to vote for Joe Biden ? And I do know what I supposed to tell them , he said . A number of people also expressed fears that the Biden administration rhetoric and positions are fanning the flames of Islamophobia in the US and putting their communities in danger . People who are publicly critical of Israel or supportive of Palestine have lost jobs and faced harassment in recent weeks . Muslim and Arab American politicians are receiving death threats and the level of vitriol is above what was experienced in the wake of , said Abraham Aiyash , a Muslim American state representative in Michigan . The president comparison of Hamas attacks to 15 , Aiyash said , enhances Islamophobia , referencing the recent murder in Illinois of a six year old Palestinian American boy in an alleged hate crime . If you support Israel war abroad , you have to be ready for the consequences of it at home , he said . A demonstration in Dearborn , Michigan . The critical swing state is home to Arab Americans who helped boost Biden after Clinton narrow 2016 loss . Photograph : Matthew Hatcher Getty Images Multiple Palestinian Americans who do not work in politics declined to speak with the Guardian over safety fears . Any potential for political fallout for Biden is greatest in Michigan , a critical swing state that is home to Arab Americans who helped boost Biden after Clinton narrow 2016 loss . Biden beat Trump in 2020 by about votes . Few if any issues are more important to this group than Palestine and Middle East foreign policy , said Amer Zahr , a Palestinian American activist and comedian . He noted that Dearborn , a majority Arab American city just outside Detroit , went for Bernie Sanders by a significant margin during the last two Democratic presidential primaries because Sanders was willing to challenge US policy on Israel . But Biden was viewed as better than Trump , so Arab Americans turned out in the general election , Zahr said . Next time , many people have said , they will vote third party , or leave the top of the ticket blank . Dearborn went 63 for Clinton in 2016 when she lost the state by votes , but nearly 80 for Biden four years later . In the four municipalities with the largest Arab American populations in metro Detroit , about more people voted for Biden than Clinton . They came into our community and asked us to vote for Joe Biden and save America from Donald Trump , and now we feel like we have to save Palestine from Joe Biden , Zahr added . The argument that we heard before is we have to save the country from Trump that not going to work . If 2024 is going to be a close election then the loss of Arab American support for Biden could have an impact , said the state pollster Bernie Porn . The White House lazy language and the skewed portrayal of the crisis in US media dehumanizes Arabs Palestinians , in particular , said James Zogby , the founder and president of the Arab American Institute , a Washington DC based civil rights advocacy organization . This objectification of Palestinians and the humanization of Israelis which is an old story going back to the beginning of the conflict fed into the pre existing narrative that it Israeli people versus the Arab or Palestinian problem , he said . The White House , he added , sets the tone , and it important for us to let the administration know , you at risk of losing this particular component group of the community . Those who spoke with the Guardian said they found the situation especially frustrating because they expected this kind of policy and positions from Republicans , but not Democrats . What makes me incensed with Democrats is that they preach human rights , preach equality and diversity , but when it comes to Palestinians , all the preaching goes away , and there is justification for the killing and slaughter , Ahwal said . I know the ramifications and I know the consequences but I can not justify a vote for a guy who says it OK to kill Palestinians .',\n",

This is not what we want , not what we looking for . We do want escalation , Blinken said . \" We do want to see our forces or our personnel come under fire . But if that happens , we ready for it . Austin , echoing Blinken , said what we seeing is a prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region . Israel Hamas war , Day 17 LIVE updates He said the has the right to self defence and we wo hesitate to take the appropriate action . The warning from the high ranking officials came as Israel military response to a deadly October 7 attack by Hamas on civilians in communities in southern Israel entered its third week . Israeli warplanes struck targets across Gaza overnight and into Sunday , as well as two airports in Syria and a mosque in the occupied West Bank allegedly used by militants as the war threatened to engulf more of the Middle East . Israel has traded fire with Lebanon Hezbollah militant group on a near daily basis since the war began , and tensions are soaring in the Israeli occupied West Bank , where Israeli forces have battled militants in refugee camps and carried out two airstrikes in recent days .

              " 'Reliance Disney deal : Indian media business headed towards duopoly ? The Broadcast Audience Research Council BARC is an industry body and hence stakeholders must themselves come up with a solution , reiterated Information and Broadcasting Secretary Apurva Chandra during an exclusive conversation with in his Delhi office . He also stressed that the government has no intention of regulating the content on OTT platforms or streaming services . In the interview with Kanchan Srivastava , Chandra also shared the government plans for the media and entertainment sector . Excerpts : There were speculations that the government may put a stay on TRPs of news channels before the elections if they continue to show provocative content . Any comments ? As of now , there is no such plan . BARC has started sharing Raw Level Data RLD with channels now . Earlier , the news channels complained about the lack of data and transparency . The objective is to bring transparency and allow channels to track wrong algorithms or manipulation , if any , and then BARC can correct it . The complaint now is that the data is voluminous and ca be interpreted . They have to try to make sense of it . Are you satisfied with the functioning of BARC ? India is a diverse country with so many languages , and rural urban and economic divides . There are just panel homes but only a part of the population consumes news . Hence , the margin of error is big . We do receive complaints from the General Entertainment Channels GECs , which are the largest chunk , in terms of revenue . The issues are largely raised by news channels . What could be the reasons behind their complaints against BARC measurement ? There are panel homes . Among them , the households that consume news may be with English news consumption further limited to around 500 homes . Even a small error that creeps in , can be multiplied and magnified due to such a small sample size . What is the way out ? Does MIB have any plans to intervene in the matter ? News channels themselves are divided on this matter . Some have a particular view about it , others have entirely different opinions . There is no unanimity among news channels . BARC is an industry led body ; both broadcasters and advertisers are part of it . The government has no role to play here . The council has to manage on its own . As per MIB latest statistical handbook that you released a few weeks ago , television revenue growth has slowed down in . It would be one of the slowest growing mediums in the next two years at , as per projections . Are you concerned about it ? TV revenue is not growing at the pace it grew before . Nevertheless , it is still growing . Advertising is growing more on the digital side , but it does mean that TV revenue is not growing . Content creation on the news side continues to grow on TV . India has a lot of potential and people are watching both TV and OTT . Historically , some sectors go up , some go down . To retain the interest of people , even GECs are innovating with content and have come up with reality shows . How many new TV channel applications have you received so far this year ? As per MIB data , only 7 new channels were launched in , while 20 were shut down in the two years before that . I do have the exact numbers . Applications keep coming . Besides , we have come out with new guidelines that include increasing the minimum net worth requirement to open a news and current affairs channel from Rs 2 crore to Rs 20 crore . For non news channels , it was hiked to Rs 5 crore . The net worth cap was never revised after 2004 . Do you think it may impact the government revenue as well ? We feel only serious players should be there . There are over 350 news channels in the country , and the number of satellite channels is about 950 . But how many channels can you name ? The Indian Broadcasters and Digital Foundation IBDF has requested TRAI to deregulate the broadcasting sector and remove the price cap , which faces a dwindling paid subscriber count and competition from DD Free Dish and OTT platforms . What is the MIB stand on this ? TRAI is a regulator and has to look after the interests of both subscribers and broadcasters . It has taken a view of the scenario . TRAI modifies regulations every two years . NTO 1 New Tariff Order and NTO were implemented earlier and now NTO is being implemented effectively . There is no issue from the customer side and not much from the broadcasters side as well . Are some directives likely on the cards for the news broadcasting ad industry ahead of the elections ? Why should we issue any directive on elections ? For us , the only issue is fake news . News channels are supposed to follow the code of conduct all the time . As long as people conform to the code of conduct , no new directive is required . However , many news channels are still being accused of running fake news , with regards to the Israel and Palestine war as the latest example . It a matter of taking action . The code of conduct is a robust system . Over the past year , we have blocked 200 news channels for peddling fake news and disinformation . Many of them were YouTube channels with crores of subscribers . Some of them were Pakistan based , and some were based in Canada , run by Khalistan supporters . It been more than a year since the big four broadcasters pulled out their FTA channels from DD Free Dish . How has it impacted DD Free Dish revenue ? On the contrary , DD Free Dish revenue has gone up to Rs crore , 30 40 per cent more compared to the previous year when it was Rs 750 crore . News channels on Free Dish are giving more revenue this year . At the time when things are going digital , what lies ahead for DD in the future ? When will DD launch its own OTT platform ? We are working on a plan to develop an OTT platform . DD and AIR have a lot of archival material , which nobody else has . Until the , there were no private channels . Speeches , discussions , interviews , performances of iconic artists like M S Subulakshmi , Bhim Sen Joshi and Bade Ghulam Ali and TV serials are lying in our archives . Now , people want to consume everything on OTT because it so convenient . Although a lot of our content is available on YouTube , but its cataloguing makes it difficult for people to search . If we have our OTT channel , people will easily access our rich content . Will DD OTT be free for viewing ? Will it be launched before the elections ? Prasar Bharti is still working on that . It is likely to be launched next year . There may be a small subscription fee but things are yet to be worked out . The ministry had issued a directive to all TV channels early this year to air nationalistic interest programmes for at least 30 minutes every day . How many channels abide by the directive ? We did tell them to air some national interest programmes . However , it is the news channels that largely carry public interest programmes . GECs also carry several programs on social issues .',\n",
              " 'What is the axis of resistance of Iran backed groups in the Middle East ? LONDON Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a warning this week that the United States would act \" swiftly and decisively \" if it came under attack from Iran or its proxies in the Middle East , amid growing concerns of the Israel Hamas war spreading . His warning came as the White House accused Iran of facilitating attacks on military bases in Syria and Iraq in the last week . Questions about the extent of Iran involvement in Hamas 7 attack on Israel have shone a spotlight on Iranian influence in the Middle East and raised major concerns about the prospect of a wider war engulfing the region . The has said there is no direct evidence that Iran was involved in the Hamas attack against Israel . However , analysts and regional experts say there areevident links between Iran and the attacks carried out by Hamas . \" Hamas and Iran have a long standing but not always easy relationship , \" says Kim Ghattas , author of Black Wave , a book about the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran . \" Hamas gets funding and weapons from Iran . So whether or not it approved of the 7 attack , Iran is complicit . \" Ali Barakeh , a senior Hamas official based in Lebanon , told NPR earlier this month that while \" Iran knows that Hamas fights Israel and offers us support , which we do not deny we do take orders from anyone . \" What is the link between Iran and Hamas ? Hamas , a Sunni Islamist movement , is an autonomous Palestinian group with military and political wings . Hamas has ruled more than 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since 2007 . Gaza has not had elections since Hamas seized power that same year from the Palestinian Authority , which rules the West Bank . Hamas receives funding and weapons from Iran . The two have had rifts in the past , and do not always agree . Most recently , they fell out over Syria civil war . Tehran withdrew funding from Hamas when the group chose to stand with protesters against Syria leader Bashar Assad , whom Tehran supports . Hamas also has other backers , including Turkey .

What is the \" axis of resistance \" ? Hamas comes under the so called \" axis of resistance , \" a multi pronged network of different forces across the region , supported to varying degrees by Iran . The term \" axis of resistance \" is believed to have emerged in response to President George Bush use of the term \" axis of evil \" referring to Iran , Iraq and North Korea in his 2002 State of the Union address . There are conflicting reports about who first coined the term , which is often used by Iranian officials . The \" axis of resistance \" is an informal , loose knit alliance that includes both Sunni and Shia Muslim groups and governments in Yemen , Syria , Lebanon , Gaza and Iraq , with differences and varying levels of proximity to one another and to Tehran . The Iranian regime and its Quds Force , a subset of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard corps , have grown this network more on the basis of shared resistance to Western powers and Israel . The axis includes the Lebanese militant group and Shia political party Hezbollah , the Syrian regime and Shia militias in Syria , which Tehran has built up and trained . Yemen Houthirebels also come under the axis . The Houthis have fought a civil war against Yemen government which is backed by Saudi Arabia for nearly a decade . The Pentagon said last week it had shot down missiles from Yemen that were potentially headed for Israel . Francesca Volpi Bloomberg via Getty Images Francesca Volpi Bloomberg via Getty Images People pass a poster featuring Hassan Nasrallah , secretary general of the Hezbollah party , during parliamentary elections in Beirut , Lebanon , on May 15 , 2022 . The axis also comprises militias in the influential Iran backed Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq , which were formed to help fight ISIS in 2014 . In Lebanon , Iran backed Hezbollah operates both as a Shia Muslim political party and militant group . Hezbollah wields significant power , especially in southern Lebanon , and is active along Israel northern border , where tensions have been building since the 7 attacks . Each axis group has a different relationship with Iran . They also have differences with one another . In Gaza , both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad a smaller , rival militant group that does not engage in the political process are considered part of the alliance . Unlike Hamas , however , the PIJ receives most of its budget from the Islamic Republic . \" It is important to remember that Hamas is not a proxy of Iran in the way that Hezbollah is , \" says Ghattas , who is also a distinguished fellow at the Columbia Institute of Global Politics and spent two decades covering the region as a journalist for the BBC and the Financial Times . \" Hezbollah has become an extension of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds Force , \" Ghattas says . \" Hamas keeps its own separate identity and it has other backers , aside from Iran . \" But despite their differences , Ghattas says , their interests often converge , as is the case this month . \" Their agendas still align in an anti American , anti Israel worldview , and they come together again when necessary , \" Ghattas says . \" Unity of fronts \" and more coordination between Iran backed groups According to reports in the international media , Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah met senior officials from Hamas in Beirut Wednesday to discuss the situation in the Middle East . A statement following the meetingsaid their goalwas to achieve \" a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine \" and halt Israel \" treacherous and brutal aggression against our oppressed and steadfast people in Gaza and the West Bank . \" Earlier this year , Nasrallah began referring to a \" unity of fronts . \" The idea was that these disparate groups all benefiting from Iran support would coordinate in their opposition to Israel . Experts say there has been more cross border coordination between these groups in recent years , even before Nasrallah specifically called for this . \" Over the past couple of years , Iran has been working to coordinate its proxies in what it describes as a unification of fronts , surrounding Israel on all fronts , \" says Ghattas . \" It is a more logistically coordinated operation , rather than each group doing its own thing . \" This includes Hezbollah in Lebanon and other , less direct proxies , like Hamas in Gaza , Ghattas says .

Paul Salem , president of the Middle East Institute in Washington , told NPR Ailsa Chang , \" It quite likely that Hezbollah knew of the preplanning for the 7 attacks and probably participated in training and planning with Hamas , and all of them sort of are part of this Iranian proxy force deployment that you have in Lebanon , in Syria , in Yemen , in Iraq and in Gaza as well . \" How the Iran backed alliance might influence the war Mohanad Hage Ali , a Beirut based senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center , told NPR Scott Simon that the \" unity of fronts \" of Iranian backed proxy groups is \" a kind of NATO for militant groups \" in the region , requiring allied organizations to step in and provide military support should any other member groups face an existential threat . \" I would suppose that Hezbollah would find it difficult not to intervene , although it remains a challenge given the cost of the conflict and what it means for Lebanon , \" Hage Ali told NPR . And preventing a broader war consuming the region similarly requires coordination and tight control over the battlefield , Ghattas says . \" More cross border coordination allows the Iranians to tightly control escalation and deescalation , \" she says .

              " 'Biden threads a needle with US strikes against Iranian backed militias CNN The United States intended to send a strong message to Iran with strikes against pro Tehran militia groups in Syria that had targeted American troops while seeking to avoid a dangerous regional escalation amid Israel war with Hamas . By targeting an ammunition and storage area on Thursday night US time , Washington sought to make clear that recent drone and rocket attacks that caused minor injuries to 21 US soldiers in Iraq and Syria will not go unanswered . But the action is also risky because of soaring tensions as Israel pounds Gaza after October 7 terror attacks against Israeli civilians launched by Hamas another Iran allied group . That conflict has provoked fears of a regional war that could draw in Iran , Lebanon and other proxy groups . President Joe Biden show of strength could set off its own cycle of consequences that could rock a region already on edge . While the US is underscoring that the strikes have nothing to do with the confrontation between Israel and Hamas , such distinctions may be blurred in Arab nations , where public fury is mounting over the deaths of Palestinian civilians in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza . The US actions , which were narrowly tailored in self defense , targeted two facilities linked to Iranian backed militias in eastern Syria , according to a statement from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin . The statement said the facilities have been used by Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC and affiliated groups . Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces . We will not let them , Austin said . Biden political flank Biden has been under domestic political pressure to take a stand against Iranian proxies . Realistically , there was no option but to respond to an attack in which American soldiers were injured . Still , the limited scale of the move is unlikely to placate Biden domestic critics , who have long accused him of being soft on Iran . Such criticism ratcheted up after the administration secured the freedom of five prisoners held by Iran last month in return for the transfer of 6 billion in frozen Iranian funds . The administration says the funds can only be used to buy humanitarian supplies but that has not spared Biden from Republican attacks over Hamas attack on Israel earlier this month . The US airstrikes are also certain to , at the very least , heighten the rhetorical tensions between the US and Iran , which are already at alarming levels . Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian , for instance , warned the US that if Israel military operation against Hamas in Gaza following the group terror attacks does end , the United States will not be spared from this fire . The US strikes came a day after Biden put Iran on notice about the activities of its militia during a press conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese . And Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday warned that while the US does seek conflict with Iran , it would act swiftly and decisively to respond to attacks by Iran or its proxies in the region . US begins Middle East build up Ever since Israel started to respond to the Hamas attacks , there have been concerns in Washington that US interests in the region could be threatened . Multiple US officials have told CNN that the US has intelligence that Iranian backed militia groups are planning to ramp up attacks against American forces in the Middle East as Iran seeks to capitalize on the backlash in the region to US support for Israel . The airstrikes followed another sign that the US , which has been seeking to disengage from the Middle East , is being drawn back into the region because of the danger to its ally Israel . The Pentagon announced earlier in the day that roughly 900 troops have been deployed or are deploying to the Middle East after a series of attacks on coalition bases that resulted in minor injuries for almost two dozen troops . Biden had previously ordered the deployment of two aircraft carrier groups to the eastern Mediterranean in a show of deterrence to enemies of the US and Israel in the region . Pentagon spokesman Brig . Pat Ryder said Thursday that between October 17 and 26 , US and coalition forces were attacked at least 12 separate times in Iraq , four separate times in Syria , by a mix of one way attack drones and rockets . Some 21 US service members have received minor injuries as a result of attacks between October 17 and 18 , CNN has reported . Of those , 19 have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury , Ryder said 15 at al Asad Air Base in Iraq , and four at al Tanf Garrison in Syria .',\n",

              " 'Explained : What Is Nuclear Test Ban Treaty And Why Is Russia Withdrawing Russia parliament has passed the last stage of a law to withdraw Moscow ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty CTBT , which now goes to President Vladimir Putin for signing . Here is a look at some questions that raises . What is the CTBT ? The CTBT , agreed in 1996 , bans \" any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion \" anywhere in the world , with the goal of reducing and ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons . Its preamble says it is aimed at supporting disarmament and non proliferation by constraining the development of nuclear weapons and stopping countries producing more advanced ones . Which countries have signed and ratified ? A total of 187 states have signed the treaty , and 178 have ratified it in their parliaments . Of the nine countries that possess nuclear weapons : Britain and France have signed and ratified . Advertisement The United States , Israel and China have signed but not ratified . Russia signed and ratified but is now withdrawing ratification , saying it is \" mirroring \" the position . India , Pakistan and North Korea have yet to sign or ratify . What is the legal status of the treaty ? The treaty is not legally valid until 44 named countries sign and ratify it all nine that have nuclear weapons , and 35 others that possess nuclear power and research reactors . Does it have any practical effect then ? Yes , in practice the treaty has created a taboo against explosive nuclear tests . No country has carried such a test since the except North Korea , which conducted the most recent of its six tests in 2017 . Advertisement The treaty established a global network of observation posts that can detect the sound , shockwaves or radioactive fallout from a nuclear explosion . When complete , it will comprise 321 monitoring stations and 16 laboratories , hosted by 89 countries . Around 90 are already operational , including in Russia and the United States . What Does the Russian Shift Mean ? Russia says it is not planning to conduct a test , and will not do so unless the does . But some analysts see a Russian test as more likely now . Putin has issued what the West sees as nuclear threats since the start of the Ukraine war and may be keeping testing in reserve in case Russia fortunes decline sharply , when he could use it to warn the West to back off . Publicly , he has not said if he thinks a test is needed or not . What Would a Nuclear Test Achieve ? Not much in scientific terms , experts say , because full scale detonations can be accurately simulated using \" subcritical \" tests without a nuclear chain reaction . Both Russia and the United States have advanced research programs to understand weapon performance and behaviours , said Dylan Spaulding , senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists : \" That kind of research does require full scale testing , it requires computer modelling . \"',\n",
              " 'Release of Israeli hostages requires ceasefire , says Hamas official Two fighter jets struck weapons and ammunition facilities in Syria on Friday in retaliation for attacks on forces by Iranian backed militias since the Gaza conflict erupted . Israel says it is preparing a ground invasion , but has been urged by the and Arab countries to delay an operation that would multiply the number of civilian casualties in the densely populated coastal strip and might ignite a wider conflict . Gaza Moscow : A Hamas official tied the release of hostages held in Gaza to a ceasefire in Israel punishing air war in the enclave , launched after a deadly rampage by Hamas militants into southern Israel nearly three weeks ago . An opinion poll published on Friday suggested almost half of Israelis now wanted to hold off on a ground invasion out of fears for at least 224 hostages reported to be held there . The Russian newspaper Kommersant quoted a member of a Hamas delegation visiting Moscow as saying time was needed to locate all those who had been taken from Israel by various Palestinian factions in the Hamas attack on 7 that sparked the crisis . They seized dozens of people , most of them civilians , and we need time to find them in the Gaza Strip and then release them , Abu Hamid said . He said Hamas , which has freed four hostages so far , had made clear since the first days of the war that it intended to release civilian prisoners . But he said a calm environment was needed to complete this task , repeating an assertion which Reuters could not verify that Israeli bombing had already killed 50 of the prisoners . Palestinian militants clashed with Israeli troops in at least two areas inside the Gaza Strip , the latest of several small scale incursions , Hamas affiliated media reported , though the Israeli military did not immediately confirm the sortie . Residents of central Gaza said they had heard what sounded like an exchange of fire as well as heavy shelling and air strikes along the border , with Israeli planes dropping flares and bombs . Israel said its fighter jets had struck three senior Hamas operatives who played significant roles in the 7 attack , all commanders in the Daraj Tuffah Battalion . There was no official announcement by Hamas . In the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza , an air strike killed the pregnant wife of a Palestinian lawyer , Jehad Al Kafarnah . My life , my heart , I love you , Kafarnah wrote , weeping , on the white sheeting wrapped around his wife body . He held the body of her 8 month old stillborn child , also wrapped in white , in his arms . Gaza civilians grow more desperate As Gaza million civilians grow more desperate under an Israeli siege that has cut power and water as well as supplies of food , fuel and medicine , the issue of how to help them comes before the 193 member General Assembly in New York on Friday . Unlike in the Security Council , where resolutions on getting aid to Gaza failed this week , no country will be able to veto the resolution submitted by Arab states calling for a ceasefire , which will not be binding but carry political weight . The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees , UNRWA , says more than Gazans have been made homeless by Israeli bombardment , at least three times more than its shelters can hold . Ten more trucks food and medical supplies arrived in the enclave , along with 10 foreign doctors , on Friday , the first to enter since Israel tightened its blockade on Gaza nearly three weeks ago , a Palestinian official at Gaza Rafah border crossing with Egypt said . A official said earlier that around 74 trucks had crossed since the start of the conflict , making some 84 altogether . The says Gaza needs around 100 trucks every day to meet essential needs and the official said negotiations were taking place with Israel , which wants to prevent resources reaching Hamas , to find a faster mechanism . US strikes Syrian bases used by Iranian proxies Calls for restraint have been driven not only by concern for Gaza civilians and Israeli hostages , but also by fears that the crisis could ignite conflict across the Middle East . President Joe Biden ordered overnight strikes on two Syrian facilities used by Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps and militias that it backs , the Pentagon said . He earlier issued a rare direct warning to Iran on Thursday against targeting troops in the Middle East . and coalition troops have been attacked at least 19 times in Iraq and in Syria by Iranian backed forces in the past week . The United States has sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region over the last three weeks and on Thursday the Pentagon said about 900 more troops were en route or in the Middle East to bolster air defences for personnel . Israel says Hamas killed some people including children in its 7 rampage . The Hamas controlled Gaza health ministry said on Thursday that Palestinians had been killed in the retaliatory air strikes , including children . Reuters could not independently verify the tolls . A poll published in the Israeli daily Maariv newspaper found that 49 said it would be better to wait before beginning a large scale ground offensive , while 29 disagreed . A poll a week earlier had found 65 support for a ground invasion . It is almost certain that the developments on the matter of the hostages , which is now topping the agenda , have had a great impact on this shift , Maariv said .

But Israel envoy was adamant , declaring again , We will not rest until Hamas is obliterated . The war sparked by Gaza Hamas rulers surprise attacks on Israel on October 7 played out in the vast hall of the 193 nation General Assembly , where Arab nations expected to adopt a resolution on Friday calling for an immediate cease fire in Gaza after the Security Council four failed attempts to agree on any action . At the assembly resumed emergency special session on Israeli actions in the Palestinian territories on Thursday , speaker after speaker backed the Arab resolution cease fire call except for Israel UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan , who told the 193 member world body , A cease fire means giving Hamas time to rearm itself , so they can massacre us again . Also Read Pak election commission rules out any delay in polls after President Alvi casts doubt After quoting several Hamas statements vowing to destroy Israel and the Jews , he said , Any call for a cease fire is not an attempt at peace . It is an attempt to tie Israel hands , preventing us from eliminating a huge threat to our citizens . But the calls for a cease fire , the protection of Palestinian civilians facing constant Israeli bombardments in Gaza and the delivery of desperately needed food , water , medicine and fuel were often passionate and intense from nearly a dozen countries that spoke Thursday . While the Hamas attacks killed some Israelis , more than Palestinians have been killed in Israel retaliatory airstrikes , according to the Gaza Health Ministry . On another key issue the more than 220 hostages taken from Israel Iran foreign minister said Hamas is ready to release civilian prisoners , and he said the international community must take responsibility for releasing Palestinian prisoners held in Israel . Iran stands ready to play its part in this very important humanitarian endeavour , along with Qatar and Turkiye , Hossein Amirabdollahian told the assembly . Iran is a key backer of Hamas and Qatar has already played a key role in the release of four Israeli civilians . Israel Erdan said the country action has nothing to do with the Arab Israeli conflict or the Palestinian question . This is not a war with the Palestinians . Israel is at war with the genocidal Jihadist Hamas terror organisation , he said . But Riyad Mansour , the Palestinian UN ambassador , said 70 per cent of those killed in Gaza were children and women . Is this the war some of you are defending ? Can this war be defended ? These are crimes . This is barbarism , he said . If you do not stop it for all those who were killed , stop it for all those whose lives we can still save , he said . The anguish over the deaths on both sides was palpable . Mansour voice cracked when he spoke of a Palestinian girl killed before the birthday her father had planned and a man hugging the body of his dead mother and saying : Come back , and I will take you wherever you want . Erdan voice rose when he told the assembly of Hamas fighters firing blindly at hundreds of young people at a concert in southern Israel , parading naked girls that they had raped , and crushing the skulls of babies . He showed a brief video of a badly injured agricultural worker from Thailand being decapitated with a blunt gardening tool . Jordan Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi , speaking on behalf of the 22 nation Arab Group , spoke emotionally of children dying under the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli precision bombs , and some still alive and trapped with no equipment to pull them out . The parents can still hear them . They talk to them helplessly , knowing that they are running out of air and are slowly dying , he said . In a sharp rebuke to the Israeli ambassador , he told the assembly , I do have videos to show you . We respect the dead too much . We respect the pain of their families too much to show videos . Safadi also criticised Erdan for not saying a word about Palestinian lives shattered in this war . Do let them tell you this is a war between Muslims and Jews , he said . We value life , Muslim life , Christian life , Jewish life . He was interrupted with applause when he then said , We care about all lives . Do let them tell you otherwise . The Jordanian minister also told Israel that it can not remain above international law requiring protection of civilians , hospitals , schools , homes and other infrastructure . The right to self defence is not a license to kill with impunity , he stressed . Safadi also criticised the United States and its allies without naming them . Many among us believe that they are helping Israel by supporting its war , he said . They are not . Instead of sending weapons to Israel , send delegations to open an immediate and viable path to peace . This is how they can help Israel . Iran Amirabdollahian accused the United States of directly participating in the war and what he called a genocide against the Palestinians . The genocide in Gaza must stop immediately , he said . He warned against the uncontrollable consequences of the unlimited financial , arms and operational support by the White House to the Tel Aviv regime which has added to the severe bombardments and killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza .

It says that essential goods including food , water and medicine should be provided in the Gaza Strip . It also calls for Israel to rescind its order for Gazans to move from the north to the south , for maximum restraint and for the release of all civilians . Unlike the Security Council , there are no vetoes in the General Assembly and its resolutions are not legally binding .

              " 'Ground offensive in Gaza at the time of our choosing , says Israel govt spokesperson Eylon Levy Eylon Levy , the Israeli government spokesperson , has said that military action inside the Gaza strip will happen at the \" time of our choosing \" and focus of his country is to \" totally destroy the military and governing capabilities \" of Hamas . The terror attack by Hamas on October 7 shocked the West Asian country and the world , during which 1400 Israelis were killed and over 200 taken as hostages . Speaking to WION diplomatic correspondent Sidhant Sibal , Levy said , \" We are going to destroy Hamas , we are going to enter the Gaza Strip and totally demolish the entirety of its military terrorist and governing structure inside the Gaza Strip . \" Since the attacks , Israel increased its air strikes in Gaza to deal with Hamas hideouts , but this has led to a humanitarian crisis as well . The spokesperson explained , \" Israel is targeting civilians , we are targeting Hamas . That why we are asking civilians inside the Gaza Strip to step out of the way , out of the areas that are going to see very heavy fighting because we do want them to get hurt as we proceed with our campaign to destroy Hamas terror infrastructure \" . Here the full interview : WION : Will there be a ground offensive in Gaza , particularly northern Gaza in the next few days ? Eylon Levy : Israel remains united around one goal , victory , total victory against Hamas . Our goal is to totally destroy the military and governing capabilities of the brutal terror organization that perpetrated the October 7 massacre . This is the worst terrorist attack in world history since . Around 1400 Israelis were murdered , Hamas death squads went door to door and beheaded babies , burning whole families alive , committing brutal acts of rape , tying parents and children together and setting them on fire , mutilating them , torturing them before their deaths . About people have been injured . There are now more than 220 Israeli hostages , some babies as young as a few months old in captivity , hostages inside the Gaza Strip and we decided in response to that , that we are going to totally defeat Hamas . Now Israel is going to use its force carefully and judiciously , we will act and proceed with the ground offensive at a time of our choosing , when it is right for our operational needs . But the world needs to understand that the situation now is different . The road ahead is going to be long . It is going to be difficult , but Hamas declared war on us on the seventh of October with that brutal attack against our people and we have no choice now but to win that war . And that war will end with the total defeat of Hamas in the Gaza Strip . WION : The Israeli president claimed that Hamas used cyanide . Can you elaborate ? Eylon Levy : President Isaac Herzog said that Hamas fighters had in fact been carrying on their bodies instruction manuals from al Qaeda , the terror organisation behind 911 , showing that they had information in order to build cyanide , use chemical weapons against our people . This shows the connection between Hamas , al Qaeda and ISIS , and shows exactly why it in the same league as the terror organisations all around the world who commit horrific crimes against humanity that they have perpetrated . This is why we are going after Hamas with an intent to destroy it , not to deter it , not to degrade it , to destroy it , because Hamas has revealed itself as the face of sheer , pure , unadulterated evil that would do by the way , exactly the same as it did on October the seventh if given half a chance and murder as many people inside Israel as it could by burning them , by beheading them , using chemical weapons if it could , and that is why we are going to continue with our campaign to destroy Hamas . And , we appreciate all the international support and solidarity that we been receiving , including from the people of India , all around the world , people understanding that Israel not only has a right , it has a duty to defend itself against these barbarians , these terrorists in the wake of these atrocious , atrocious crimes against humanity . WION : While Israel has been acting against Hamas , there has been a humanitarian challenge in Gaza . You have asked the people to move towards the south . So , what do you have to say about the humanitarian and the collateral loss which is happening in Gaza ? Eylon Levy : First and foremost , I would say that the humanitarian question is on the minds of Israelis around the country , and so is the fate and condition of the more than 220 Israeli hostages , inside the Gaza Strip . We talking about babies some a few months old . Elderly people over the age of 80 without medication being kept in a brutal tunnel somewhere by a terrorist organization that tortured , murdered their families in Israel , not given access to the Red Cross . Now it the humanitarian question that is concerning everyone in Israel . But as for the civilians in Gaza , it important to say Israel is targeting civilians , we are targeting Hamas . That why we are asking civilians inside the Gaza Strip to step out of the way , out of the areas that are going to see very heavy fighting because we do want them to get hurt as we proceed with our campaign to destroy Hamas terror infrastructure . Now , we all been watching the same images on TV , the images coming out of the Gaza Strip are very difficult to watch . And I think the world is right to be outraged . But that outrage needs to be directed at the brutal terrorist organization that has subjugated the people of Gaza for the last 16 years subordinating them to its terrorist regime . It should be directed at the terror organization that has consistently stolen humanitarian aid , the terror organization that has embedded itself among civilian areas , under people homes , under schools , under hospitals and the terror organization that is physically preventing people from escaping and as much as Israel is trying to do everything we trying to do to keep civilians safe inside the Gaza Strip . By the way , Israel has also evacuated over of our own people away from areas of combat because we do want them to be hurt , but it important to understand everything that happens inside the Gaza Strip . Any human suffering that happens there is solely and squarely the responsibility and fault of Hamas , the evil terrorist organization that perpetrated the October 7 massacre . WION : Do you think that the situation is getting worse in the northern border ? Do you expect Hezbollah to open another front which can be a worrisome factor for Israel ? Eylon Levy : Israel is not interested in a war on two fronts , despite Hezbollah efforts to escalate the situation in the north and step up its attacks against our people , our forces under the direction and guidance of Iran . Israel does not want to fight on two fronts . We are focusing at the moment on destroying Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to the October 7 massacre . But it important to understand that Israel is ready to fight that war . We are ready to defend our people and we will win that war . We hold the state of Lebanon responsible and accountable for any attacks emanating from its territory and as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the consequences for Lebanon will indeed be severe . If Hezbollah drags us into a full scale war , we do want that to happen , but if they do , we ready to fight . We ready to defend our people and we ready to win . WION : As you mentioned the hostage situation is a concerning situation as many of them are foreign nationals as well . What do you expect , any positive glimmer of hope ? We saw two American hostages being released . So , when it comes to the fate of other hostages , what kind of conversations are happening ? Eylon Levy : First of all , we of course welcomed the release of the two hostages . There are now more than another 220 and we expect more international pressure to secure their release as well . Our demand is clear and unequivocal . We demand the immediate and unconditional release of every single one of those hostages , we demand that In the meanwhile , they be given access to the International Red Cross . That a basic humanitarian condition . We want them back and Israel is going to do everything necessary in order to bring back our hostages from those babies to the elderly people and make sure that they are brought back to the loving embrace of their families because there is no excuse , there is absolutely zero excuse for ripping a baby , shooting its parents and taking it into captivity inside the Gaza Strip . No excuse in the whole world must be absolutely clear that what Hamas did was a war crime , that it unforgivable . And we need our people back . WION : You talked about the ground offensive . Does that option remain on the table because there a lot of anger in Israel over the terror attack by Hamas . So , is this an option that will be eventually exercised by the Israeli government ? Eylon Levy : The next stage in the campaign to destroy Hamas . I not going to speculate live on TV exactly when that will happen . But it will happen in accordance with our operational needs . Because the October 7 massacre showed us that we as a country simply can no longer live beside an ISIS style terror organisation . We can no longer leave it with the abilities to perpetrate such a massacre . Again , we will not accept a quick fix . That takes us back to the situation at 6 am on the morning of October 7 . We are going to destroy Hamas , we are going to enter the Gaza Strip and totally demolish the entirety of its military terrorist and governing structure inside the Gaza Strip . We going for complete victory and we going to use our force carefully and judiciously as we pursue that goal .',\n",

              " 'The Guardian view on America new speaker : the right gets its man Editorial With the election of Mike Johnson of Louisiana as the new House speaker , the US has now got its federal government back . Without a speaker , Congress can not function . For the past four weeks , the House of Representatives has been a phantom legislature . It has been absent without leave at a time of global crisis . The return to business is therefore better than a continuation of the paralysis on Capitol Hill . But it has been obtained at a very high price . In September , the former speaker Kevin McCarthy made a deal with House Democrats to avoid a government shutdown . In revenge , eight implacable Republicans voted for Congressman Matt Gaetz motion to oust him , which passed with Democrat support . The Republican caucus then immobilised Congress through several failed attempts to elect a new speaker . Mr Johnson has now succeeded as he has accumulated fewer enemies , because pragmatists want an end to the impasse and because the right thinks that he is their man . In other words , Mr Gaetz has won . He has orchestrated the removal of an establishment Republican House leader who was prepared , up to a point , to work with Democrats to keep government alive and to pass legislation , in favour of a relatively little known rightwing Conservative who may not be . With a 17 November deadline looming for the renewal of government funding , Mr Johnson readiness to make the deals that a narrowly divided Congress like this one normally relies on will be put to the test soon . But making deals is not the culture of the Republican party today . And Mr Johnson knows that Mr Gaetz will be watching his every move . Mr Johnson profile may be less confrontational than that of other possible candidates . But his record is the opposite of encouraging . He has strong religious conservative views on issues like abortion and same sex marriage . He does not believe that human beings cause climate change . He has voted against aid to Ukraine . Above all , he supports Donald Trump lies about the 2020 presidential election being rigged and stolen . He helped lead legal efforts to reverse the results of the election in Georgia , Michigan , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin . He opposes attempts to bring Mr Trump to justice . The speakership is powerful , but Mr Johnson is relatively inexperienced and there are big issues that need to be decided very quickly . They include the terms for the continuation of government funding , aid to Ukraine and military support for Israel . With Mr McCarthy now gone , it is possible that the right will cut Mr Johnson some slack . Certainly , the US can not afford another month like this one . If nothing else , it should end the system that gives a single member of Congress , like Mr Gaetz , the power to bring the system to a halt . Yet an even larger question stalks the coming months . The shambles of the last four weeks has been the exclusive responsibility of a dysfunctional Republican party , in hock to its dysfunctional former leader , and which no one can grip effectively without risking their career . At national level , the Republican party is now the institutional abnegation of good government . It will take more than Mr Johnson to change that .',\n",
              " 'Opinion War Wide Web : India information warfare takeaways from Israel Hamas conflict The first known use of information warfare in our history happened on the day of the Mahabharata . Dronacharya was appointed commander of the Kaurava army after Bhishma fell . Lord Krishna hatched a plan to kill Dronacharya , under which Yudhishthira loudly uttered a lie Ashwatthama is dead . Though he clarified immediately that he meant Ashwatthama , the elephant , Lord Krishna told the drummers to drown out his voice . In the process , Dronacharya laid down his weapons and was killed . A deliberate lie was propagated towards a purpose and opposing countermeasures drowned in the fog of war . advertisement The current conflicts in the world have reinforced the emerging belief that future hybrid wars will be won only with the right combination of kinetics and non kinetics , , Information Operations IO . Narrative building and its sustenance will play an extremely vital role in deciding the end state . Lose the narrative and you lose the war ! Nothing shows this more than the ongoing Hamas Israel war , where world opinion , so vital for battle sustenance , was momentarily lost by Israel , the aggrieved party , after the Gaza hospital bombing was attributed to it . The gruesome acts of Hamas , only a few days earlier , were easily eclipsed and put aside , even by most Israel supporters . A swift clarification , with substantive proof , settled the fake narrative . Even ahead , as Israel launches its ground operations in the Gaza Strip , the misery of residents may lead to a public opinion flip and subsequently escalation control . In future wars , information narratives will dictate military objectives and strategy . Information warfare : A new face of war Social media and the individualised ability to livestream have made every person a domain warrior . Let see how the Information Warfare IW unfolded in this conflict let me clarify : though IO and IW are contextually different , I am using them here synonymously . The moment the war broke out , social media went wild . Events overtook each other , and videos got uploaded from both sides , from bystanders , by media organisations . The speed at which these happened , and the barbarity of it all , stunned not only the world but also the Israel Defence Forces IDF . The subsequent response got delayed . Intentional videos were released by competing sides to prove their respective points . Truth was the first victim ; whom and what to trust was the conundrum . The concomitant effect on the public was very pronounced . Information Operations were not only carried out for surprise and deception but also for strategic coercion , for legitimacy to own operations and for international support . There were also situations where the opposing side activities went on an unexpected tangent : the requirement of contingency planning emerged . Hamas used seized social media accounts of kidnapped Israelis to broadcast violent messages and wage psychological warfare . Such rapidly evolving threats required close monitoring and appropriate response . Speed was of the essence as also the need to be proactive , staying ahead in the narrative . Misinformation was deliberately inserted and was difficult to detect : minor victories obtained by the other side appeared significant and had a demoralising effect . Tactical and strategic issues got enmeshed . The line between combatants and non combatants got blurred . advertisement Basically , IW involves the use of media and communication capabilities to manipulate data by careful insertion , deletion or alteration and disseminate it to deceive the enemy , to undermine the quality of opposing sides information feed and to carry out psychological warfare . With the use of social media as a vector , it has also permeated into human related aspects of decision making , morale and building support . Superior technology also permits one side to piggyback opposing side networks to connect , communicate and cut off all at vital moments in battle . Another rapidly developing capability is artificial intelligence AI . AI bots can now respond to situations on their own , converse in a fluent manner and can be used in multiple roles for IO . Future wars will need to factor in information war facets into combat operations . India has a lot of catching up to do advertisement In the Indian context , we have two prominent inimical neighbours Pakistan and China of which the northern one is a superpower . It is enhancing its capabilities at an alarming pace . In the recent past , specifically in Ladakh , we were behind in the information war . The western adversary has its own agency , the Inter Services Public Relations ISPR which also has developed considerable IW capabilities . We have a lot of catching up to do . With Pakistan , we share language , history , religion and customs , so it is easy to anticipate what information operations it can attempt . The actual test will be to prevent enemy IO from breaching or exploiting its own ethnic cohesion . Pakistan has always attempted to destabilise our information space by spreading fabricated disinformation via IT bots , Pakistan based handles , impersonation accounts and trolls . Their favourite themes are the treatment of minorities and Kashmir . Counteroperations are easier to plan and insert since Pakistan depth is limited , and language is no barrier , all means available to us can be used radio , TV , media , Internet and even our own diasporas . The broad spectrum of own IOs would aim at targeting Pakistan territorial integrity , history , identity , ideological cohesion , economy , international standing and ethnic strife and its previous losses to India . advertisement With China , it is a different ballgame . China aims to deter and disrupt its opponent capability to use data by targeting its information system and decision making process , thereby critically curtailing the adversary will or ability to fight . This is done across the global cyberspace , public web domains and social media platforms . China has in the past attempted IO , like in 2010 when it used the Stuxnet virus to infect our communication satellite . Two years after that , it introduced malware in Eastern Naval Command computers . Similar attempts were also made against DRDO and ISRO , and after Galwan . Remember those videos of troops fighting and being captured ? After these attempts , our systems have been suitably hardened and protected with countermeasures . Our IO with China suffers from a two fold disadvantage language and curtailed freedom of the target population . China has its own Internet and permeating that for influence operations would be a huge challenge . The need of the hour Capability development is thus required at two levels . At the national level , we need an IW organisation to counter non combat threats which may emerge during battle , to maintain and protect national perspective , image and security concerns , use soft power influence to shape perceptions in the conflict national and international and attempt to erode enemy nation credibility aimed at destabilising it . Basic tasks will include challenging and authenticating the enemy disinformation campaign , its rebuttal , tracking the flow of information , and move to counter and block the enemy networks . Lastly , formulate narratives supporting own operations and project these leveraging traditional media and current digital platforms . The list is not exhaustive . With the national level organisation doing its job diligently , at the armed forces level , the requirement will be protecting own military assets , thereafter intermeshing psychological warfare , cyber warfare , strategic deception with tactical operational plans and dissemination of these not only through traditional means but also by social media . For this , the armed forces need enhanced capability of monitoring the social media domain , and the means to quickly verify information to activate contingency plans . An organisation will have to evolve with structures which facilitate these abilities . The present strategic communication organisations in the services are inadequately equipped for this . A dynamic structure is needed , perhaps flowing down from a tri service apex body . The writer is an infantry veteran and has served in critical higher command structures . He has also been the Indian Army spokesperson twice . Views expressed in this opinion piece are that of the author .',\n",

              " 'Netanyahu Warns Hezbollah Against New War Front Hezbollah will make the mistake of its life if it starts a war with Israel , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday , as tensions continue to surge on the Israel Lebanon border . Netanyahu visited troops on the Lebanese border in northern Israel where mounting artillery exchanges have heightened fears of a new war front opening as Israel battles Hamas in Gaza . The Israeli defence ministry on Sunday ordered 14 additional communities to join dozens that have already been evacuated from the border area . In the event of scaled up hostilities , Netanyahu said Hezbollah will make the mistake of its life . We will strike it with a force it can not even imagine , and the significance for it and the state of Lebanon will be devastating . Hezbollah is allied with Hamas , which touched off the latest violence with an October 7 rampage that killed at least people in Israel , according to authorities . Israel has retaliated with relentless strikes on Hamas in the Gaza Strip that have killed more than Palestinians , according to Gaza health ministry . It has in parallel exchanged fire with Hezbollah across its northern border . Since October 7 , the exchanges have killed at least 33 people in Lebanon , according to an AFP tally mostly combatants but at least four civilians , including a Reuters news agency journalist . Another four people have been killed in Israel three soldiers and one civilian . Israel has evacuated villages on its side , while several thousand Lebanese have fled border regions for the southern city of Tyre . Tank battle : The Israeli army on Sunday said its forces identified a terrorist cell attempting to launch anti tank missiles toward the Avivim area along the border with Lebanon . Soldiers struck the cell before it was able to carry out the attack , it said . The army also said an anti tank missile was fired at an Israeli tank in the area of Har Dov , in the disputed Shebaa Farms border district . The tank returned fire , the army added , reporting no damage or casualties on the Israeli side . Lebanon official National News Agency said Israeli aircraft overflew south Lebanon on Sunday and Israel had bombed various sites along the border . The tit for tat attacks have so far been relatively contained , but analysts have warned that Hezbollah could scale up its action if Israel launches a ground invasion of Gaza . Hezbollah number two Naim Qassem warned Saturday that the group could step up its engagement . Israeli army spokesman Jonathan Conricus warned that Hezbollah is dragging Lebanon into a war that it will gain nothing from , but stands to lose a lot . Hezbollah is playing a very , very dangerous game . They escalating the situation . We see more and more attacks every day , he continued .

              " 'How Tunnels Help Hamas in Gaza Can Israel Destroy The Underground Network The October 7 surprise attack by Hamas on Israel was planned and communicated using a network of hardwired phones built in a network of tunnels underneath Gaza , recent US Intelligence reports have unveiled . The phone lines in the tunnels allowed Hamas operatives to communicate with one another in secret and can not be tracked by Israeli officials , according to a report in CNN . The Israel Defense Forces have referred to the tunnels built by Hamas over the last decades as the Gaza metro . The underground tunnel system used by Hamas have a series of advantages : store rockets and ammunition caches , passage between Hamas controlled areas and smuggle weapons , fighters or other contraband from Egypt to Gaza . History of the Gaza Metro Tunnels Since the , the tunnels have been an integral part of the life in Gaza . However , its significance increased after Hamas removed Fatah from the seat of power and severe restrictions were imposed on the movement of goods and people by Israel and Egypt on the territory . Gaza 14 kilometre border with Egypt was burrowed under with hundreds of tunnels used to smuggle fighters , weapons and other contraband although many have now been destroyed . However , some of the tunnels located across their border with Gaza were destroyed by Egypt . During the 2014 Gaza war , Palestinian gunmen used tunnels to blindside Israeli forces . Since then , Israel has been developing detection technologies and constructed an underground concrete barrier with sensors to foil attempts to dig across the border . The passageways have been a mystery for the world forever with very little known about it in the outside world . Israel has repeatedly raised the issue of Hamas operating these tunnels beneath Gaza . Israel army and intelligence became aware about a portion of the network and bombarded it heavily in 2021 . However , a large part of the tunnel system remains secret and will make any Israel Defense Forces IDF ground operation in Gaza more difficult . All About Gaza Metro The narrow web of streets in Gaza , one of the most populated areas in the world , is doubled underground by a dense tunnel network or the Gaza Metro . The labyrinths of tunnel are believed to be 41 km long and 10 km wide . But in 2021 , Hamas claimed to have built 500 km of tunnels under Gaza , though it is unclear if the figure was accurate . But since 2014 , Hamas has been digging underground pathways to get around territory it controls . Some tunnels are as deep as 30 or 40 metres below ground , allowing militants to change position away from the danger of strikes . We have all now heard about how bad Hamas tunnels are , but what can the do about them ? Fill with cement , seawater , smoke ? Bunker busters ? I sat down with on my podcast to discuss it all . Have a listen . M John Spencer October 20 , 2023 Rocket batteries hidden just a few metres beneath the surface can be uncovered with a trapdoor just for the time it takes to fire a salvo . Hamas knows its tunnels by heart , Colin Clarke , research director at the New York based Soufan Center think tank said . He added that some are probably booby trapped . Preparing to fight in such terrain would require extensive intelligence which the Israelis may not have . Why are These Tunnels Valuable Tunnels have been an efficient tool of warfare since a long time . Currently , they offer militant groups like Hamas an edge in asymmetric warfare , negating the technological advantages and advanced military which the Israeli forces have . The vast network of tunnels has been crucial since the Gaza territory has been under a land , sea and air blockade by Israel and a land blockade by Egypt since 2007 as well . Hamas has been using the tunnels underneath the Egyptian border for smuggling fuels , weapons and commercial goods by Palestinian based groups . The tunnels beneath Gaza have also been used to transport people and goods and store rockets and ammunition caches and house Hamas command safe from Israeli aircraft and surveillance drones . Role in Attacks Against Israel Israelis have often referred to these as terror tunnels and further restricted the entry of construction materials into the Gaza Strip . In 2006 , Hamas captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalid and killed his two colleagues in a cross border raid using tunnels , according to a report in Wion . The soldier remained under Hamas control for two years before he was released under a prisoner exchange deal . In 2013 , the Israel Defence Forces discovered a km long , deep tunnel with concrete roof and walls . The tunnel , which ran from the Gaza Strip to land near an Israeli kibbutz , was found after strange sounds were heard by the residents . In 2020 , Israel discovered a new cross border tunnel from the Gaza Strip and its military said extended dozens of metres underground and into southern Israel . While Israel relies on bunker buster bombs and Merkava tanks , it has to tackle booby traps while Hamas operatives aware of the underground network use it to strike , hide and escape . It also tough for Israel military to locate the tunnels , which may be under buildings or structures . However , there are several ways to do so , including using radar and other detection techniques that can measure thermal patterns , magnetic signatures and acoustics , according to DW . Role in Latest October Attacks The shocking attacks by Hamas which shook Israel earlier this month was a combination of simultaneous attacks via air , water , land and rocket strikes . The Israel border with Gaza remains fenced and has sensors installed which can detect movement . According to experts , the tunnels may have played an important role in the undetected crossing of Hamas operatives into Israel . The fence built by Israel on the border with is 30 feet high and has an underground concrete barrier . Therefore , the only way Hamas operatives were able to enter Israel undetected would have been using tunnels under the barrier and the fence . Released Israeli hostages have also stated that the tunnels were used to keep them . Yocheved Lifshitz described the unimaginable hell of her kidnapping ordeal that included being held in a spiderweb of wet tunnels after she was abducted from Israel . With inputs from agencies',\n",

              " 'Law and Survival in Israel and Palestine by Janina Dill During previous military operations in Gaza , Israel leadership sustained a remarkably disciplined message about Israel commitment to international law , often claiming that its military operations not only met legal demands , but exceeded them . Israel nonetheless faced allegations of non compliance with the laws of war , for instance , the criticism from scholars and civil society organizations that the Israel Defense Forces IDF caused disproportionate collateral damage in Gaza in 2009 and 2014 . Such criticism was met with official rebuttals , vociferous denials by Israeli commentators , and scholarly articles dedicated to defending Israel as the most moral army in the world , with a track record of preserving human rights under the difficult conditions of urban conflict that is commendable . All seems different now . While some legal experts still express faith in the Israeli military , lawyers and their system , the message this system is broadcasting to the world features significantly fewer mentions of international law than in the past . When Israel political and military leadership have acknowledged the laws of war , allies have been reluctant to publicly press for details on how operations in Gaza meet legal requirements . Meanwhile , statements by Israel senior political and military leadership routinely fail to differentiate between Hamas and Palestinian civilians , admit to the use of the civilian population as a means to compel Hamas , cast doubt over whether Palestinians deserve protection from attack , and legitimize their collective punishment for the horrific terror attacks of 7 . This change in discourse , and the change in conduct that it hints at , are a grave error with devastating legal , strategic , and moral implications . Legal Implications Statements by the senior military and political leadership have evidentiary value in a legal evaluation of Israel current operations . Some violations of international law rules for the conduct of hostilities are not visible in military operations alone , but depend on their purpose . To identify indiscriminate attacks , the use of starvation as a method of war , or forced displacement , more is required than an attack that kills , starves , or displaces civilians . However , when Israel Defense and Energy Ministers both express the intent to compel Hamas by depriving the Gaza strip of fuel , food , and water , initiating a siege with devastating humanitarian consequences , there is a plausible legal case to be made concerning the criminal use of starvation as a method of war . When viewed against the backdrop of Israeli President Isaac Herzog statement that an entire nation of Palestinian civilians is responsible for supporting Hamas , Israel bombing of densely populated neighborhoods in Gaza starts to look like recklessly caused civilian harm . An evacuation order may become a violation of the prohibition on forced displacement if it is necessary primarily because the IDF is destroying residential buildings in an unlawful manner . Crucially , Hamas acts of terrorism on 7 do not raise the question of evidence for intent or questions about purpose in the same way . The murder , abduction , and sexual assault of civilians , including children and the elderly , in their homes and at a music festival , are acts easily classed not only as violations of international humanitarian law IHL , but also as war crimes . These heinous acts are unambiguous in their intent : harm and terrorize Israel civilian population . The additional evidentiary value of statements expressing such intent is therefore lower . For Israel , by contrast , the discursive abandonment of international law and expressions that betray the intent to harm Palestinians have legal implications . More evidence would , of course , be required in a criminal trial of individuals involved in these acts , for instance before the International Criminal Court , which has jurisdiction . But the argument that all IDF operations are compatible with IHL is decreasingly plausible . This , meanwhile , has strategic implications . Strategic Implications Legality affects public support for the use of force in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom . Studies have shown that the claim that a policy violates international law decreases public support for drone strikes , aerial bombing , torture , military intervention , domestic human rights violations , or the poor treatment of refugees . Notably , the effect of framing these policies as illegal is relatively modest . Support for bombing civilians decreases by 9 and for drone strikes by 6 , for example , when these policies are framed as violating international law . Yet , the question is not only whether the public responds to claims about the legality of military operations , but also whether it prefers operations that comply with the laws of war , in the first place . For instance , does public support for military operations depend on whether and how they cause civilian casualties ? One study of American respondents indeed shows that air strikes that conform to international law meet with more support than those that do not , even when international law is not mentioned . Americans prefer air strikes against combatants to those against civilians and air strikes against military objectives to air strikes against civilian objects , even when the operations contributions to victory is the same . Significantly , Americans do not seem to care whether civilians contribute to the war they simply prefer strikes that minimize harm to individuals designated as civilians . In short , a body of scholarly work suggests that legality , both claims of compliance with international law and actually choosing targets that conform to international law , bolsters public support for military operations specifically in the United States . But when we bring these studies in conversation with Israel current operations in Gaza two significant caveats emerge . First , the concern that many ordinary people display for civilian casualties is fragile . Studies suggest that people are ready to sacrifice many foreign civilians if this is necessary for military victory or for keeping their own troops out of harm way . Second , Western publics , specifically the British and American publics who have been shown to care about international law , fight wars of choice far away from their own territory . Should we expect Israelis , who live with the threat of rocket fire and terrorist attacks to have the same views about international law and the importance of protecting non compatriot civilians ? Indeed , Israel is one of a handful of countries in which researchers have found backlash effects against international law . That means a very ! modest increase in support for a policy that is framed as violating international law . Moreover , two studies that directly compare respondents from different countries have shown that Israelis are more hawkish than people in the United States , France , and the United Kingdom and that they are willing to risk even larger numbers of foreign civilians in order to keep their own soldiers safe than American or British respondents . One determinant of individual respondents approach to trading off risk to their own soldiers for risk to foreign civilians is whether they perceive their soldiers as freely consenting to risk taking . This belief is naturally more widespread in countries with professional armed forces than in Israel , which relies on conscription and views its soldiers as , in the words of Aser Kasher and Amos Yadlin , in military uniform . At the individual level , retributiveness often measured as support for capital punishment or agreement with statements such as those who hurt others deserve to be hurt in return is a strong predictor for whether a person supports the use of force and how easily they tolerate foreign civilian casualties . Israelis have reason to feel retributive after the national trauma of Hamas recent terror attacks . Israel is also a society with significant inter generational trauma . As Daphna Canetti and colleagues have argued for Israeli Jews , the Holocaust constitutes a collective national trauma that plays a key role in shaping identity , politics and culture . Moreover , Israel has experienced a continuous threat to its existence and exposure to this threat has been linked to confrontational attitudes toward outgroups . Given this domestic audience , Israeli leaders may not feel the need to give law a prominent place in messaging surrounding the current conflict . Yet , if Israel abandons international law or if it is seen to have skirted it through implausible interpretations , that is strategically disastrous for Israel . To understand why , we must take other crucial audiences into account . The staunchest allies of Israel are Western democracies whose governments can not , in the long run , support Israel militarily if their publics turn against it . It therefore matters that claims about compliance with international law and actual conformity with international law sustain public support for military operations in the United Kingdom and the United States . That pictures of mass deaths in Gaza further inflame publics already predisposed to enmity toward Israel should be self evident . While we lack studies about how the perceived legality of a conflict impacts popular support for it in the Middle East , it is obvious that regional populations care about the protection of Palestinian civilians . A regional escalation of the conflict , meanwhile would be devastating for Israel security . And then there are the Palestinians themselves . As Stathis Kalyvas first showed , most forms of indiscriminate violence against civilians are at best ineffective and at worst counterproductive . Studies that have investigated civilians attitudes show that aerial bombings of civilians , mass killings , terrorism , and attacks based on group membership are all associated with poor strategic outcomes . Populations affected by inter state wars over territory , in particular , become intransigent and withdraw support from negotiations the more affected they themselves are by violence . Harms perceived as intentional or unnecessary those that are most likely to violate the legal rules of distinction and precaution are associated with particularly strong rejection of the attacking party . Tragically , the very same determinants that likely account for why , in comparative studies , Israel population looks more hawkish than the British and publics exposure to threat and violence predict that further indiscriminate harming of the Palestinian population will only harden attitudes and block routes to peace both now and in the future . Indeed , in both Israel and Palestine , civilians more directly exposed to retaliation to terror attacks , as well as those that witness house demolitions or experience rocket fire , have been shown to be less supportive of peace negotiations and more radical in their voting choices . Put differently , everything we know about conflict affected populations , including Israelis and Palestinians , suggests that harming them deliberately or indiscriminately makes them more willing to assume the costs of resistance . Empirical studies of conflict give us little reason to believe that harming thousands of civilians makes either side any safer . Moral Implications It may seem odd to make strategic arguments for compliance with international law . Should not a moral argument suffice to motivate restraint and the protection of civilians ? It should , but it is crucial to recognize just how traumatic Hamas attacks of 7 were . Some Israeli voices known to be committed to international law have recently suggested that Israel is now facing an existential struggle for survival , which changes the role it can afford international law . Indeed , there is a long tradition in legal theory for the argument that law should not govern an emergency . In the famous words of Alexander Hamilton , when the life of a nation is threatened , no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which the care of it is committed . But where does a rejection of international law leave us in this conflict ? In the absence of law , morality might fill the void . What are Israelis and Palestinians morally permitted to do to defend themselves ? From a moral perspective , the permissibility of resorting to violence chiefly depends on whether it serves a just aim though even a war fought for a just cause may be unjustified if , for example , it fails to be proportional . In a conflict in which one side justifies collective punishment as resistance to terrorism and the other side justifies collective punishment as resistance to occupation , such a moral analysis is unlikely to lead either side to restraint . Depressingly , moral arguments are unlikely to reduce moral wrongdoing . International law , meanwhile , imposes the same obligations on all parties to an armed conflict regardless of their causes or ends . It upholds these obligations even when one side violates them . Who started it , who behaved worse , whose aims are more important all questions that govern our moral intuitions about the permissibility of violence are questions that the laws of war bracket . While this makes international law appear morally defective , it is law greatest moral asset in a conflict in which both sides have legitimate grievances , and where no neutral party exists to arbitrate between them . When even neutral observers intensely disagree on who has a just cause , international law remains a ground for normative claims that remain intelligible across the divide . Israel interlocutor may not be Hamas , but other Palestinian and regional actors . If both parties did what they thought morality licensed them to do , things would hardly get better . If both parties or even if just one party as my optimism is not so boundless as to consider Hamas amenable to this plea only did what international law licensed them to do , moral wrongdoing would be significantly reduced , much suffering would be avoided . To be sure , legal arguments ring hollow to those reeling from the loss of loved ones . But their leaders should know better . Precisely when two peoples threaten each other survival , legality is not a luxury they can no longer afford . Rather it becomes their last barrier against a moral race to the bottom , a normative minimum standard that third parties standing with either side need to insist on . International law is critical to survival in Israel and Palestine .

              " 'As US resists ceasefire calls , what is Biden endgame in Gaza ? The Biden administration says it is pushing to avoid regional escalation while fully backing Israel bombing campaign . Washington , DC The United States is firmly resisting calls for a ceasefire in Gaza , but as the war rages on killing thousands and risking an all out regional conflict questions are arising over its aims in backing the Israeli offensive . US President Joe Biden has pledged unconditional support for Israel while warning against an expansion of the conflict , two goals that experts have said amount to competing priorities . Not only are they at odds with each other , but the higher priority of the administration appears to be supporting Israel , rather than making sure that there is no dangerous escalation , said Trita Parsi , executive vice president at the Quincy Institute , a think tank that promotes diplomacy . US officials said they are asking Israel tough questions about its military operation in Gaza , including what the war long term objectives are . However , Washington own endgame remains largely undefined . The White House has repeatedly denied any intention to put US boots on the ground . But the US is nevertheless bolstering its military presence in the region , and according to recent media reports , the Pentagon has sent advisers to help Israel plan its looming ground invasion of Gaza . And despite Biden stated desire not to see the conflict expand , there are indications that it may still . There have been frequent clashes between Israel and the armed group Hezbollah in Lebanon , and US troops in the region have suffered targeted albeit limited attacks blamed on Iran allied groups in recent days . While these skirmishes remain contained , analysts warned that they could quickly escalate by design or miscalculation . The and our regional partners are working to build a better future for the Middle East one where it is more stable and better connected to its neighbors . It benefits the people of the Middle East and it would benefit us . President Biden October 24 , 2023 No clear objectives So what is the US plan beyond enabling the Israeli military campaign logistically with military aid and politically with diplomatic cover at international forums ? There does not appear to be a clear endgame from the Biden administration , Parsi said . When it comes to this strategic image , it very difficult to be able to discern a clear strategy that actually would have the desired results . The conflict began on October 7 , when the Palestinian group Hamas launched a surprise attack against Israel from Gaza . More than people were killed , and dozens were taken captive . Israel responded with a declaration of war the following day . It has since led a continuing bombing campaign that has killed more than Palestinians in Gaza . Adam Shapiro , director of advocacy for Israel Palestine at Democracy for the Arab World Now DAWN , a US based rights group , said it appears that the Biden administration has not formulated a clear objective despite fully backing Israel war in Gaza . Biden has called for eliminating Hamas , but Shapiro said military efforts to root out the group are unlikely to succeed . So for them to be launching this kind of open ended , unclear mission with a big named goal in mind that bears no resemblance to reality just seems like folly , he said . And I sure it going to come back eventually to harm American interests in the long term . Even more unclear , Shapiro added , is the fate of Gaza after a prospective Israeli ground invasion . Biden has voiced opposition to re establishing a permanent Israeli presence inside the besieged Palestinian territory , as it had in the past . From 1967 until 2005 , thousands of Israeli ground troops were stationed there . Brian Finucane , senior adviser for the US programme at the Crisis Group think tank , drew a parallel between the ambiguity of Israel endgame in Gaza and questions about US strategy . The US objective in supporting Israel is undefined to some extent because Israel own objectives in Gaza are undefined , Finucane told Al Jazeera . He added that even if Israel topples Hamas , it has not articulated what might replace the Palestinian group , which currently governs Gaza . Finucane also said there appears to be some tension between Washington support for Israel and its push to avoid a wider conflict . If the Biden administration is unsuccessful in deterring Iran and its allies from widening the conflict , a larger , regional war could end up involving US forces . And that should give policymakers in the Biden administration real pause . They should consider taking the advice they offering to the Israelis themselves : Think through how is it going to play out , Finucane told Al Jazeera . What is the US endgame if we were to God forbid get into an armed conflict with Hezbollah , or a deepening conflict with Iran back groups that are targeting US forces in Iraq and Syria with drones ? Negative consequences After the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , politicians on both sides of the aisle have called for restraint in any future military endeavours , reflecting wider public fatigue towards overseas conflict . But Finucane said the atrocities of Hamas attack on October 7 have shifted the conversation in Washington . Shibley Telhami , a professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland , said neither the US nor Iran seem interested in a broader military confrontation . However , they all could be dragged into this by some miscalculation or huge expansion of the war in Gaza , Telhami said . He stressed that the US should not blindly back Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu war efforts , as that stance might trigger direct American engagement in the conflict . You can not leave that in the hands of an extremist Israeli government , whose ministers are known to have views that are both at odds with American interests and at odds with American values , Telhami told Al Jazeera earlier this month . Parsi , of the Quincy Institute , also stressed that attempts to deter Iran from joining the fray could prove to be unsuccessful without applying pressure to Israel as well to show restraint . It will very well lead to the very nightmare scenario I think the Biden administration wants to avoid , he said . For now , the Biden administration is allowing Israel to carry out its intense bombing campaign , which has wiped out entire families in Gaza , according to Amnesty International . US officials have ruled out even discussing a ceasefire , saying that those conversations would ultimately benefit Hamas . Washington is also preparing a aid package for Israel , including billions in military assistance . Jon Hoffman , a foreign policy analyst at the CATO Institute , a libertarian think tank , connected the current US policy to its broader approach in the Middle East . I do know the Biden administration has a clear objective here besides praying this does spiral into a broader regional conflict , he told Al Jazeera . It should be clear from the past several decades that continuing to throw money , weapons and military assets at the region often has negative consequences .',\n",

              " 'Troops Face Attacks in Middle East In a series of videos posted on Telegram by a shadowy organization known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq , drones belonging to Iranian backed militias can be seen taking off from the desert floor and streaking into the distance . The videos are paired with ominous texts threatening further strikes and warning Iraqis to stay away from military bases in Iraq and Syria , the targets of the attacks . The location of the videos could not be independently verified by TIME , but metadata from the videos indicates that the videos were taken on days of confirmed attacks on military bases . For more than six months , Iranian backed groups have refrained from launching drones or rockets against forces in Iraq and Syria . But in the wake of Hamas 7 assault on Israel which left more than people dead , this period of relative calm has come to a sudden halt . In just the past week , forces in Iraq and Syria have been attacked 13 times , Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said at a press conference on 24 . While the attacks have been largely intercepted by missile defenses , 24 troops have been injured , Ryder said . One contractor also died from cardiac arrest during a false alarm at an air base in Iraq . While the has long sought to reduce its military forces in the Middle East , the repeated attacks by Iranian backed groups complicate the presence in the region and underscores the risks of further escalation . Here what to know about the groups threatening or attacking forces in the region . Who Are the Groups Attacking Military Bases ? Pentagon spokesperson Ryder said on 23 that the does not have any intelligence proving that Iran explicitly ordered the recent attacks . Even so , administration officials have not been shying away from pointing to Iran role in encouraging its proxies . One senior defense official told reporters on 23 , it fair to say when you see this uptick in activity and attacks by many of these groups , there Iranian fingerprints all over it . Across the Middle East , Iran has a network of proxy forces in Lebanon , Syria , Iraq , Yemen , Gaza and Bahrain . While many of the groups also have their own local agendas , they receive training , weapons and funds from Iran and bolster Tehran influence in the region . Read more : Militant Group Hezbollah Is on the Sidelines of the Israel Hamas War . Here What to Know One network in particular , the Islamic Resistance in Iraq , has taken credit for at least 11 attacks on troops so far , according to the Washington Institute . The group first appeared in the aftermath of Hamas attacks on Israel , and is an umbrella organization for a number of key Iranian backed groups in Iraq , says Michael Knights , an expert in militias in Iraq and Syria at the Washington Institute . The groups have come together under this banner to signal unity but also to hide individual culpability for attacks if they happen to kill an American , he says . It is unclear precisely how many Iranian backed groups operate in Iraq and Syria , experts say . There at least 10 or 20 , if not many more groups between the Iraq Syria border alone , says Behnam Ben Taleblu , an Iran expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies . These groups pose a threat primarily to the troops in Iraq and the 900 in Syria . But at least one Iranian backed group in Iraq , the Righteous Promise Brigades , has threatened to attack forces in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates . What Happens if the Attacks Escalate ? The militia groups have been clear in linking their latest escalations to the support for Israel . \" The Americans are essential partners in killing the people of Gaza and therefore they must bear the consequences , \" Jaafar al Hussein , spokesman of Kataib Hezbollah , one of Iraq largest militia groups , wrote on Telegram on 18 . The attacks on military bases so far are the largest barrage of attacks since the Iranian response to the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020 , experts say . So far , the attacks have been small scale rocket or drone strikes at military bases designed to withstand these kinds of attacks , says Knights , rather than large scale attacks aimed at overwhelming air defenses and killing large numbers of forces . Even so , experts say that if the attacks were to kill forces , the situation may escalate dramatically . You do launch rockets and missiles and armed drones into populated areas such as bases without a willingness to kill , says Afshon Ostovar , an associate professor at the Naval Postgraduate School . And if you going to commit lethal attacks , the escalatory ladder or dynamic that follows is never a sure thing . Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Sunday 22 that what we seeing is a prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region . If the groups decide to intensify the attacks on forces further , experts say that attacks on helicopters flying over Iraq or a return to the widespread usage of roadside bombs that killed thousands of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan could be likely strategies . The Houthi Threat In the Red Sea , the USS Carney shot down several missiles and drones that were fired by Iranian backed Houthi rebels on 19 . officials say they were not fired at the American navy destroyer , but may have been aimed for Israel . Houthi leader Abdel Malek al Houthi warned shortly after Hamas attack on Israel that if the were to get directly involved in Gaza , that his group would respond with missiles and drones . While the Houthi army is more than miles from the Israel Hamas war , they possess some of the most advanced capabilities of any of the Iranian backed groups in the Middle East . They are significantly ramping up their long range strike capabilities , says Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , which allows them to be a more effective press against international shipping and American power in the Red Sea and Bab el Mandeb , the narrow strait separating Yemen from East Africa . In response to the rising threats , the is rushing air defense systems to its Middle Eastern military facilities and has tightened security around its bases . The has also sent a number of ships , including two aircraft carriers , and additional fighter jets to the region as it seeks to deter Iran and its allies from getting involved further . The United States does not seek conflict with Iran , Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said at a tense meeting of the UN Security Council on 24 . But if Iran or its proxies attack personnel anywhere , make no mistake : We will defend our people , we will defend our security swiftly and decisively .',\n",

Eight trucks containing water , food and medicine entered the Gaza Strip from Egypt late on Tuesday , the Palestinian Red Crescent said . The United States is negotiating with Israel , neighbouring Egypt and the to smooth emergency deliveries into Gaza , but have wrangled over procedures for inspecting the aid and over bombardments on the Gaza side of the border . \" While we remain opposed to a ceasefire , we think humanitarian pauses linked to the delivery of aid that still allow Israel to conduct military operations to defend itself are worth consideration , \" a senior official said . Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said after a United Nations Security Council meeting that Israel appeared to be above international law and urged an end to what he termed \" double standards \" in dealing with the Gaza conflict . In a statement released on social media , the Palestinian health ministry said at least Palestinians had been killed by Israeli bombardments since 7 , including children . Some 704 were killed in the previous 24 hours alone , it said . Reuters could not independently verify the ministry figures . ISRAEL HITS HAMAS TARGETS The Israeli military said that it killed dozens of Hamas fighters overnight while hitting over 400 Hamas targets , but that it would take time to destroy the Islamist militant group whose deadly cross border attack on 7 stunned Israel . Secretary General Antonio Guterres pleaded on Tuesday for civilians to be protected , voicing concern about \" clear violations of international humanitarian law \" in Gaza . Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Security Council : \" Palestinian civilians are not to blame for the carnage committed by Hamas , \" referring to the militants killing of people , mainly civilians , and capture of over 200 in a one day rampage through Israeli communities near Gaza . \" Palestinian civilians must be protected . That means Hamas must cease using them as human shields It means Israel must take all possible precautions to avoid harm to civilians , \" Blinken said . Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau echoed Blinken . \" There are a lot of conversations going on now about the need for humanitarian pauses and I think that something Canada supports , \" he told reporters in Ottawa . \" We must remain anchored on the priorities of protecting innocent people and freeing the hostages . \" The World Health Organization , in the latest of increasingly desperate appeals , called for \" an immediate humanitarian ceasefire \" to prevent food , medicines and fuel supplies from running out in Gaza .

Iranian leader Sayyed Ali Khamenei addresses students in Tehran on Tuesday AFP The leader of the revolution and the Islamic Republic of Iran , Sayyed Ali Khamenei , declared on Wednesday that the US is a \" definite accomplice \" in the atrocities that the Israeli entity is committing against innocent Palestinians in the Gaza Strip . During a meeting with representatives of the Martyrs Commemoration Congress in Lorestan Province , Sayyed Khamenei said the US was indirectly managing the atrocities carried out in Gaza . \" In these crimes , America hands are up to the arm in the blood of the oppressed , the children , and the patients , \" he said .

After the start of Operation Al Aqsa Flood by the Palestinian Resistance , the Israeli entity started a bloody aggression on the Gaza Strip on October 7 . According to Al Mayadeen correspondent , the number of Palestinians martyred by the aggression exceeded , with around wounded , amid catastrophic health conditions . Homeland defenders are not terrorists Sayyed Khamenei also cautioned Muslim governments against adopting the US and certain other Western nations practice of designating the \" defenders of the homeland \" as terrorists \" . He forewarned Muslim governments and political spokespeople to exercise caution when quoting Western governments statements and to believe that Palestine will undoubtedly prevail in this and future operations . \" Is a person who defends his home and country against the enemy a terrorist ? The terrorist is that fake and cruel government that occupied his house , \" he asserted . He concluded that Palestine , not the Israeli entity , will be in control of the future world and that the Palestinians will triumph despite \" Israel \" atrocities and crimes .

              " 'France Macron calls for international coalition against Hamas The French president has proposed that the international coalition fighting IS also goes after Hamas . French President Emmanuel Macron called Tuesday for Gaza Palestinian group Hamas to be added to the targets of an international coalition against the Islamic State IS group . Macron also said there had to be a \" decisive relaunch \" of the Middle East peace process , following talks with leaders in Israel , whose army is building up to a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip with the declared aim of toppling Hamas . Macron said the Global Coalition against Daesh , or the Islamic State group IS , \" should also fight against Hamas \" . The French president said he had proposed this in talks with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and to other \" international partners \" . \" We should build a regional and international coalition to battle against terrorist groups that threaten us all , \" he told a joint news conference with Netanyahu . An Elysee Palace source said Macron proposal \" draws inspiration from the experience of the Global Coalition against Daesh and seeing what aspects can be replicated against Hamas \" . The coalition was set up in 2014 and says it has 86 \" members \" countries and groups such as the European Union and the Arab League . It has focused on countering IS in Iraq and Syria but is also aimed at cutting off funding to the extremists , the sharing of intelligence and support for many countries , including the training of Iraqi forces . \" Israel misunderstands the context in which Hamas emerged , which was as a response to a military occupation . Hamas does represent anything completely unprecedented or anything unsurprising \" Why dismantling Hamas wo end Palestinian resistance The New Arab October 23 , 2023 Macron was the latest of a string of western leaders to voice support for Israel riposte to Hamas after the 7 October attacks which Israel says left people dead . Hamas also captured hundreds of Israelis . Nearly people have been killed in Israel bombardment of the Palestinian enclave , mainly women and children . Macron said extending the coalition would benefit Israel and its neighbours who are also \" threatened \" by Hamas , which is branded a terrorist organisation by the European Union and United States . \" The battle must be without mercy , but not without rule because we are democracies which fight against terrorists , democracies which respect the right to war and assure humanitarian access , \" Macron said . Macron office said before his visit that he would seek a \" humanitarian truce \" in Gaza while in Israel , but no mention was made after his talks with Netanyahu . The French leader did call for a \" decisive \" new effort to move toward a Palestinian state , declaring : \" The Palestinian cause must be heard with reason \" . \" Israel security can not be sustainable with a decisive relaunch of the political process with the Palestinians . \" The French leader was to go to Ramallah on Tuesday for talks with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian Authority said . RELATED How Arab states could respond to an Israeli invasion of Gaza Analysis \" Tomorrow I will be with several leaders from the region to concretely advance the agenda we have given ourselves , \" he said . Macron met some of the relatives of the 30 French people killed in the 7 October attacks and the nine people missing , at least one of whom has been confirmed as being a hostage . He said freeing all hostages had to be the \" first objective \" of the military campaign . Like other western leaders Macron told Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog that Israel was \" not alone \" and stressed how France has also suffered from militant attacks . \" I think this is our duty to fight against these terrorist groups , without any confusion , without enlarging this conflict . \" With the Iranian backed Hezbollah group daily trading artillery fire with the army across the Lebanon Israel border , Western governments are concerned the conflict could spread .

Oversimplification of Palestinian identity diminishes their rich and complicated history and reduces the decades long struggle to a solely religious war . Palestine flags . Photo credit : Wikimedia Commons New Delhi : The oversimplification of Palestinian identity has been a characteristic of the ongoing media coverage of the newest deadly episode of the Israel Palestine conflict . In general , particularly in India , the focus has been on Palestinians as Muslims arrayed against Jewish Israelis . This diminishes the Palestinians rich and complicated history and reduces the decades long struggle to a solely religious war . Also read : Amazon rainforest : Why is there a drought in Earth lungs ? We shall attempt to describe the complicated history of Palestinians in this post . Palestine History Palestine is the eastern Mediterranean region that includes sections of contemporary Israel as well as the Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip along the Mediterranean Sea coast and the West Bank west of the Jordan River . The word Palestine has been widely and sometimes controversially connected with this little territory , which some claim also includes Jordan , as per Britannica . Over the period of three millennia , both the physical area represented by the name and its political position have altered . The territory or at least a portion of it is known as the Holy Land and is revered by Jews , Christians , and Muslims alike . Since the twentieth century , Jerusalem has been the site of rival claims by Jewish and Arab national groups , resulting in lengthy bloodshed and , in some cases , open combat . The meaning of the name and its origin The term Palestine is derived from Philistia , the name given by Greek historians to the land of the Philistines , who held a tiny pocket of territory on the southern shore between present Tel Aviv Yafo and Gaza in the century BCE . Also read : Israel Hamas conflict : The diplomatic ties which have ensured that UK backs the Jewish country After Roman times , the name had no official status until after World War I and the Ottoman Empire end of rule , when it was adopted for one of the regions mandated to Great Britain ; in addition to an area roughly comprising present day Israel and the West Bank , the mandate included the territory east of the Jordan River now constituting the Hashimite Kingdom of Jordan , which Britain placed under a separate administration from that of Palestine immediately after recognising Palestine . From the outset , Palestine was used primarily as a location name and later , as a moniker for the people who lived in the territory , regardless of race or religion . As a result , while employing the phrase , Roman records make no distinction between Christians and Jews . Following the Arab conquest of the Levant in the century CE , the word Palestine was largely dropped from official use . This lasted into the twentieth century . However , it remained prevalent in local usage and was adopted into Arabic as Filasteen . Indeed , Palestine is spelt Filisteen in Hindi . Demography The extraordinary political upheavals and battles that have brought this little territory to the attention of the world have had a significant impact on the social geography of contemporary Palestine , particularly the area west of the Jordan River . In the early twenty first century , Israeli Jews made up around half of the population west of Jordan , while Palestinian Arabs Muslim , Christian , and Druze and other minorities made up the rest . Although millions of immigrants have come since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 , the Jewish population is increasingly made up of people born in Israel . Also read : Explained : What is a nuclear briefcase that Vladimir Putin travels with ? The Arab population is descended from Arabs who resided in the region during the mandate period and , in most cases , for centuries prior . The bulk of Jews and Arabs today live in cities . Judaism , according to Jewish nationalists Zionists , serves as a foundation for both religious and national ethnic identity . Palestinian nationalists frequently emphasise that their shared Arab identity transcends their community religious diversity . Both Muslim Arabs 18 of the Israeli population and Christian Arabs 2 of the population identify as Arabs in the first instance . Today , the word Palestinians refers to individuals who live in the State of Palestine West Bank , Gaza , and East Jerusalem , as well as those who have fled the former British Mandate and moved elsewhere . Some Israelis who reside in Palestinian territory may also identify as Palestinians .

              " 'Israel Palestine Flare up and the Web of Disinformation in India Fake news about dead babies is used for rabble rousing so that the planned murder of real babies gains acceptance , writes Prachi Arya . The news of the alleged beheading of Jewish babies and children by the fighters of Gaza administrator Hamas in the latest flare up between Israel and Palestine spread like wildfire and has had a worldwide impact . However , more recent expositions have sought to establish the falsity of videos of Hamas beheading Israeli babies and using people , including children , as shields . In another instance , a viral video from 2016 , of a Syrian rebel group beheading a boy in Aleppo , was posted on Twitter and linked to the current crisis . Upon fact checking , similar other visuals from 2016 , unrelated to the current flare up , were also found to be falsely linked to the recent violence . A quick search on the artificial intelligence supported platform Chat GPT indicates that reports of minors being targeted by Hamas are unverified and probably false . A recent Al Jazeera article underlines the fact that most anti Palestine disinformation originated from India . It also highlights the rise of online disinformation spread by far right accounts in India . An Al Jazeera mentions that accounts allegedly linked to the BJP IT cell have been actively spreading disinformation related to the latest Israel Palestine flare up . The article mentions that accounts allegedly linked to the infamous Bharatiya Janata Party BJP IT cell have been actively spreading disinformation on the Israel Palestine conflict . BJP IT cell is a broad based term used to describe the social media and online communication wing of the Hindu right wing party which is currently the ruling regime in India . The party IT cell plays a significant role in shaping its online presence , disseminating information , and engaging with supporters and critics alike . The Indian disinformation campaign includes false claims of Hamas kidnapping a Jewish baby and a video falsely depicting Palestinians kidnapping people to be made sex slaves . The Al Jazeera article finds that many of the accounts sharing these false videos also engaged in posting anti Muslim comments on social media platforms . Such narratives only serve to flame hatred and disseminate Islamophobia and hate speech online . Fake news for more views When global crises and emergencies occur , whether it is the Covid pandemic or warring countries , technology is often co opted to serve the narrative of powerful stakeholders . In such situations , online sources that usually connect people around the world and provide access to critical information become a tool to manipulate public sentiment . Accusations of people , including children , being used as shields in both Israel and Palestine are not new . In fact , the long drawn conflict between Israel and Palestine has been marred by accusations and counter accusations regarding the use of human shields , particularly involving children . Both sides have made such claims against each other , including in 2018 and 2007 . Israeli forces deliberately place civilians , including children , in harm way to deter attacks or to gain a tactical advantage , as observed by Amnesty International and the United Nations , who have documented cases where Palestinians were allegedly coerced or forced to act as human shields . On the other hand , Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately using Israelis and Palestinians , including children , as human shields . The highly polarised nature of the conflict often leads to conflicting narratives and interpretations of events . Further , investigations into these allegations are often hindered by limited access to conflict zones and the lack of cooperation from both sides . The highly polarised nature of the conflict often leads to conflicting narratives and interpretations of events . Further , investigations into these allegations are often hindered by limited access to conflict zones and lack of cooperation from both sides . It is important to note that while the pervasive use of digital technologies exacerbates disinformation , it is by no means a product of information technology . False news predates the rise of the internet and the widespread use of digital platforms for news . For instance , the news of Hamas harming babies is strikingly similar to the Gulf War reportage claiming that Iraqi soldiers had removed babies from incubators in Kuwait hospitals and left them to die . This story was widely reported and influenced public opinion , but it was later revealed to be a fabrication part of a well orchestrated propaganda campaign aimed at justifying military intervention . What is the impact of false information ? In the digital age , the menace of false information is pervasive and has become a pressing concern . False information , referred to as disinformation when intentional and misinformation when unintentional , has far reaching consequences . It does not just shape public opinion and influence events such as elections but may also incite violence . The 2018 WhatsApp Lynchings , where messages circulated on the popular messaging platform WhatsApp spread canards about child kidnappers operating in various parts of the country and led to a wave of panic and fear among the public , perfectly illustrate this phenonemon . Tragically , multiple people lost their lives as a result of mob attacks following the false rumours . Such disinformation can include doctored images , videos and text messages , which may be designed to manipulate emotions and provoke a sense of urgency that leads to the rapid spread of false information . Arguably , the perniciousness of fake news reached its zenith during the Covid pandemic , leading to an infodemic due to the abundance of misinformation . In the WhatsApp lynching case , the lack of verification and critical thinking , combined with the rapid spread of these messages , led to a dangerous situation where innocent lives were lost due to the dissemination of false information . Arguably , the perniciousness of fake news reached its zenith during the Covid pandemic , leading to an infodemic due to the abundance of misinformation . Among other things , this included false claims about unproven treatments or cures , as well as dangerous misleading information on self medication . Even when lives are not at stake , the psychological impact of fake news can cause profound damage . Fake news often employs emotional manipulation techniques , such as using compelling narratives or evocative imagery , to elicit strong emotional responses . When individuals come across alarming or distressing headlines , it can trigger emotional responses such as fear , anger or anxiety , contributing to heightened stress levels that negatively impact mental health . As individuals struggle to discern what is true and what is false , the constant exposure to misinformation can lead to a state of heightened vigilance and mistrust , contributing to a general sense of unease and anxiety in an already tense situation . What are Indian laws regarding fake news ? In India , fake news is regulated through a complex legal framework that covers cable TV , newspapers , online platforms and films that are used to handle cases such as the 2018 WhatsApp lynching incident . To illustrate , the Supreme Court of India , in the case of Tehseen Poonawalla versus Union of India prescribed certain guidelines to state governments , including the registration of a first information report FIR under Section of the IPC other relevant provisions of law , against persons who disseminate irresponsible and explosive messages and videos having content which is likely to incite mob violence and lynching of any kind . The Indian Penal Code IPC contains provisions that can be applied to cases involving fake news and misinformation . Sections such as 153 provocation with intent to cause riot , promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion , race , etc . , and 505 statements conducing to public mischief can be invoked to address instances where fake news leads to violence , communal disharmony or public disorder . The Code of Criminal Procedure , 1973 provides the legal framework for investigating and prosecuting criminal offences in India . It includes provisions that can be applied to cases involving fake news , such as the power to conduct searches , seize evidence and arrest individuals involved in disseminating false information . When individuals come across alarming or distressing headlines , it can trigger emotional responses such as fear , anger or anxiety , which contribute to heightened stress levels that negatively impacts mental health . More recently , Section of the proposed Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill , 2023 , which was introduced in Lok Sabha in August to revamp Indian criminal laws , seeks to punish the spreading of fake news or misleading information that jeopardises the sovereignty and security of India with jail time of up to three years or a fine , or both . The Information Technology Act , 2000 IT Act includes provisions to address various cybercrimes . The dissemination of disinformation and misinformation is primarily dealt with under Section 79 of the IT Act . The Section provides immunity to intermediaries , such as social media platforms , from liability for any third party content hosted on their platforms . However , intermediaries are also required to comply with certain due diligence requirements , including taking down or restricting access to unlawful content upon receiving a court order or a government directive . Thus , while the Section offers protection to intermediaries , it does not absolve them of their responsibility to address fake news . If an intermediary receives actual knowledge or is notified by the appropriate government agency about the presence of fake news on their platform , they are required to promptly remove or disable access to such content . In recent years , the need for intermediary liability and regulations to address the spread of fake news has been highlighted . The Indian government aimed to hold intermediaries accountable for the dissemination of false information and proposed amendments to the IT Act to address this issue more effectively . These developments culminated in the notification of the Information Technology Intermediaries Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code Rules , 2021 Rules in February 2021 . Although they do not directly address fake news , the Rules require online intermediaries and news publications to comply with certain baseline measures for addressing the issue of fake news and misinformation . However , due to the alleged draconian nature of the Rules , they are facing several legal challenges in Indian courts . One problem is that the attempts by the government to regulate fake news , as exemplified by the amendment to the IT regulatory framework , have a tendency to make the government the sole arbiter of what is true and what is false . This is obviously problematic , particularly in democracies , because governments are run by political parties which have a vested interest to present one version of the truth at the cost of others . The Information Technology Act , 2000 IT Act , includes provisions to address various cybercrimes . The dissemination of disinformation and misinformation is primarily dealt with under Section 79 of the IT Act . While the Indian government efforts to tackle fake news are commendable , several challenges persist . The sheer volume and speed at which misinformation spreads on social media platforms pose a significant challenge . The lack of awareness and media literacy among certain sections of society also hampers the effectiveness of these initiatives . Importantly , striking a balance between curbing fake news and protecting freedom of speech is a delicate task as government overreach may cause a chilling effect on free speech and much needed critical journalism . What is the response of social media and online platforms ? The response of social media platforms to disinformation has been mixed at best . It involves measures such as implementing fact checking systems to identify and label false or misleading information as well as to provide users with additional context while directing them to verified sources of information . Apart from partnering with fact checkers , online platforms also undertake content moderation and removal , as well as algorithmic adjustments to reduce the visibility of false or misleading content and promote reliable sources of information from trusted sources . User reporting and flagging also help platforms identify and review potentially problematic content more efficiently . For instance , Google approach to fighting misinformation online involves teams of experts working to provide users with high quality and trusted information , while also reducing the spread of harmful content . The company has implemented rules and policies across their services to prohibit certain types of misinformation . Google also collaborates with partners worldwide to counteract fake news and has signed agreements such as the European Union EU Code of Practice on Disinformation . The tech giant has also explored innovative approaches such as prebunking to build resilience against misleading narratives . While Google and other online platforms have been collectively called out by lawmakers from the EU and United States US , X formerly Twitter seems to have emerged as the biggest loser in the war against disinformation . While Google and other online platforms have been collectively called out by lawmakers from the EU and the US , X seems to have emerged as the biggest loser in the war against disinformation . X has faced more controversy regarding its approach to fake news since Elon Musk took over the social media company . According to their website , X aims to create a safe and informed environment by taking various actions against misleading content . They have separate policies for crisis misinformation , synthetic and manipulated media , and election integrity . Misleading content confirmed to be false or shared in a deceptive manner may be labelled , have reduced visibility , or be removed . X also takes actions to inform and contextualise by sharing information from third party sources . They may prompt users when engaging with misleading posts and launch pre bunks during important events . X is also testing features for users to report misinformation and provide additional context through community notes . However , there has been a flood of disinformation and fake news on the platform , mainly related to the latest Israel Palestine flare up since the platform made changes that removed headlines while displaying articles and due to heavy layoffs in its trust and safety teams that oversee daily communications and mitigate the posting and spread of false content . These changes have raised concerns about X ability to provide reliable information . The problem of disinformation through videos is not limited to pro Israel propaganda . Last week , a viral video on X supposedly showed a Hamas fighter firing a shoulder mounted rocket cannon and taking down an Israeli helicopter . Later , the footage was found to be from a video game called Arma 3 . However , despite community notes pointing out its deceptive nature , the video is still up on multiple accounts on X , and even Facebook . Who watches disinformation from the watchdogs ? BJP IT cell is known for its extensive use of social media platforms , including X , Facebook and WhatsApp , to promote the party agenda , counter opposition narratives , and mobilise support . Listed as the IT , website and social media management department on the BJP website , it is often described as a well organised strategic unit . Members of the BJP IT cell are known for their active participation in online discussions , debates and campaigns . They often amplify the party messages , defend its leaders and policies , and disparage political opponents . The problem of disinformation through videos is not limited to pro Israel propaganda . Last week , a viral video on X supposedly showed a armed fighter firing a shoulder mounted rocket cannon and taking down an Israeli helicopter . Later , the footage was found to be from a video game called Arma 3 . The IT Cell is also involved in monitoring and responding to news articles , fact checking the opposition party claims , and disseminating party related information . Increasingly , it is evident that some sections of the BJP , especially the BJP IT cell , have been involved in spreading misinformation , fake news and hate speech , although not all members of the BJP engage in such activities . For instance , a recent report found that 205 or 80 percent of the 255 documented anti Muslim hate speech from gatherings in the first half of 2023 occurred in BJP ruled states and Union territories . This complicates an already divisive scenario , where sections of the political party in power may be actively involved in spreading disinformation about the ongoing Israel Palestine flare up . What are some solutions to combat fake news in situations of crisis ? The availability of real solutions seems to be at its nadir , considering the magnitude of disinformation and its deleterious effects . Moreover , it is increasingly evident that politicians and powerful technology companies may ultimately profit from fake news . Various platforms such as news agencies and ChatGPT suggest that users take matters into their own hands and verify the authenticity of news . Establishing fact checking organisations specialising in verifying the accuracy of news stories . These include Snopes , , and PolitiFact . Indian fact checkers include and . This should be a growing tribe . Some suggested measures include : Cross referencing multiple sources and using well established news organisations with a track record of reliable reporting . Evaluating the credibility of sources considering factors such as journalistic standards , editorial policies and history of accurate reporting while being cautious of sources known for spreading misinformation or having a clear bias . 3 . Checking news articles for primary sources and citations that add credibility to news reports . Establishing fact checking organisations specialising in verifying the accuracy of news stories . These include Snopes , , and PolitiFact . Indian fact checkers include and . This should be a growing tribe . Being sceptical of sensational or clickbait headlines and reading articles fully and substantially to evaluate the content before accepting the headline as accurate . Considering the presence of bias and being cautious of sources that consistently present a one sided or extreme viewpoint . Using critical thinking skills and looking for logical inconsistencies , unsupported claims or lack of evidence . Another solution lies with relatively neutral truth finding bodies such as the UN . Through the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory , it included East Jerusalem Palestinians and Israelis undertaking an extensive investigation of current events and identifying those responsible for violations of international law on all sides , both those directly committing international crimes and those in positions of command responsibility . Undeniably , even if facts triumph over disinformation in this battle for truth , the Israel Palestine crisis only seems to be worsening . Much like the fake news of beheaded babies , real children on both sides are its most tragic victims .

When that conflict ended in 1949 , some Palestinians were displaced in what they refer to as the Nakba , Arabic for catastrophe , and the territory was divided into the state of Israel , the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . Israel has occupied the Gaza Strip , West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967 , when it captured the Palestinian territory in the Six Day War . Conditions in Gaza where some million Palestinian refugees live have deteriorated since 2007 , when Israel imposed a blockade after Hamas seized power in Gaza . Tensions , conflict and deadly attacks have continued over the 16 years since .',\n",
              " 'Mike Johnson elected House speaker on first ballot with support from all Republicans WASHINGTON AP Republicans eagerly elected Mike Johnson as House speaker Wednesday , elevating a deeply conservative but lesser known leader to the seat of power and ending for now the political chaos in their majority . Johnson of Louisiana swept on the first ballot with support from all Republicans anxious to put the past weeks of tumult behind and get on with the business of governing . A lower ranked member of the House GOP leadership team , Johnson emerged as the fourth Republican nominee in what has become an almost absurd cycle of political infighting since Kevin McCarthy ouster as GOP factions jockey for power . While not the party top choice for the gavel , the deeply religious and even keeled Johnson has few foes and an important GOP backer : Donald Trump . I think he gon na be a fantastic speaker , Trump said Wednesday at the New York courthouse where the former president , who is now the Republican front runner for president in 2024 , is on trial over a lawsuit alleging business fraud . READ MORE : GOP loses House speaker nominee after pushback from Trump dooms Emmer bid Trump said he had heard one negative comment about him . Everybody likes him . Three weeks on without a House speaker , the Republicans have been wasting their majority status a maddening embarrassment to some , democracy in action to others , but not at all how the House is expected to function . Far right members have refused to accept a more traditional speaker , and moderate conservatives do want a hard liner . While Johnson had no opponents during the private roll call late Tuesday , some two dozen Republicans did not vote , more than enough to sink his nomination . But when GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik rose to introduce Johnson name Wednesday as their nominee , Republicans jumped to their feet for an extended standing ovation . House Republicans and Speaker Mike Johnson will never give up , she said . Democrats again nominated their leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York , criticizing Johnson as an architect of Trump legal effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election he lost . With Republicans controlling the House only 221 212 over Democrats , Johnson can afford just a few detractors to win the gavel . Overnight the endorsements for Johnson started pouring in , including from failed speaker hopefuls Jim Jordan , the hard charging Judiciary Committee chairman , gave his support , as did Majority Leader Steve Scalise , the fellow Louisiana congressman , who stood behind Johnson after he won the nomination . Mike ! Mike ! Mike ! lawmakers chanted at a press conference after the late night internal vote , surrounding Johnson and posing for selfies in a show of support . Anxious and exhausted , Republican lawmakers are desperately trying to move on . Johnson rise comes after a tumultuous month , capped by a head spinning Tuesday that within a span of a few hours saw one candidate , Tom Emmer , the GOP Whip , nominated and then quickly withdraw when it became clear he would be the third candidate unable to secure enough support from GOP colleagues after Trump bashed his nomination . He was MAGA , said Trump , referring to his Make America Great Again campaign slogan . Attention quickly turned to Johnson . A lawyer specializing in constitutional issues , Johnson had rallied Republicans around Trump legal effort to overturn the 2020 election results . Elevating Johnson to speaker would give Louisianians two high ranking GOP leaders , putting him above Scalise , who was rejected by hard liners in his own bid as speaker . Deeply religious , Johnson is affable and well liked , with a fiery belief system . Colleagues swiftly started giving their support . Democracy is messy sometimes , but it is our system , Johnson said after winning the nomination . We going to restore your trust in what we do here . Matt Gaetz , R , who led a small band of hard liners to engineer McCarthy ouster at the start of the month , posted on social media that Mike Johnson wo be the Speaker the Swamp wants but , he is the Speaker America needs . Republicans have been flailing all month , unable to conduct routine business as they fight amongst themselves with daunting challenges ahead . The federal government risks a shutdown in a matter of weeks if Congress fails to pass funding legislation by a 17 deadline to keep services and offices running . More immediately , President Joe Biden has asked Congress to provide 105 billion in aid to help Israel and Ukraine amid their wars and to shore up the border with Mexico . Federal aviation and farming programs face expiration without action . Many hard liners have been resisting a leader who voted for the budget deal that McCarthy struck with Biden earlier this year , which set federal spending levels that far right Republicans do agree with and now want to undo . They are pursuing steeper cuts to federal programs and services with next month funding deadline . Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she wanted assurances the candidates would pursue impeachment inquiries into Biden and other top Cabinet officials . During the turmoil , the House is now led by a speaker pro tempore , Patrick McHenry , R , the bow tie wearing chairman of the Financial Services Committee . His main job is to elect a more permanent speaker . Some Republicans and Democrats wanted to give McHenry more power to get on with the routine business of governing . But McHenry , the first person to be in the position that was created in the aftermath of the 11 , 2001 , terror attacks as an emergency measure , declined to back those overtures . He , too , received a standing ovation . Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in New York contributed to this report .',\n",
              " 'Make No Mistake : Blinken warns Iran against attack on Americans , says US does seek conflict In a stern warning to Tehran , the US said it would respond swiftly and decisively if Iran or its proxies attack Americans anywhere . The statement was made by Secretary of State Antony Blinken as the country tries to keep the West Asian nation from joining the Israel Hamas war . During a UN Security Council meeting Tuesday , Blinken said the US does not seek conflict with Iran . We do not want this war to widen . But if Iran or its proxies attack US personnel anywhere , make no mistake : We will defend our people , we will defend our security , swiftly and decisively , Blinken said . The US Secretary of State spoke to the 15 member UN Security Council amid international fears that the conflict between Israel and Iran backed Palestinian Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip could loom large . Blinken also urged the members of the UN Security Council , including Russia and China , to tell Iran not to open another front against Israel or attack its partners , and to hold them accountable if it does so . Do throw fuel on the fire , he said . To all the members of this council : If you , like the United States , want to prevent this conflict from spreading , tell Iran , tell its proxies in public , in private , through every means do not open another front against Israel in this conflict . Do not attack Israel partners , Blinken said . The remarks by Blinken were the latest in the US stepped up campaign to call out what it says is Iran involvement in violence in the region against US forces , along with its support of Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon who have launched rocket attacks on Israel in recent days . His statement came hours after US , on Monday , said it would hold Iran responsible for a spate of drone and rocket attacks on US forces in the region . Meanwhile , the US has been taking new steps to protect its troops in West Asia as concerns mount about attacks by Hamas , a report by Reuters mentioned officials as saying . Warships and fighter jets have also been sent by the US in the war struck region to try to deter Iran and Iran backed groups . Groundless allegations Later , Iran UN Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani told the Security Council that Blinken had attempted to wrongly blame Iran for the Israel Hamas conflict and that Tehran categorically rejected his groundless allegations . Iravani said , Our commitment to regional peace and stability remains unwavering . The US has further exacerbated the conflict by overtly aligning itself with the aggressor at the expense of the innocent Palestinian population , he added . With inputs from agencies',\n",

Israeli jets carried out a barrage of airstrikes in southwest Lebanon on Saturday night , killing at least five Hezbollah fighters and marking the first time that Israeli jets struck Lebanese territory since the start of border clashes on 8 October . The strikes targeted the town of Aita as Shaab and the vicinity of Yaroun close to the Lebanese Israeli border , bringing the number of Hezbollah fighters killed since the start of the conflict to 18 . Earlier on Saturday , Hezbollah announced that they targeted an Israeli military barracks in the upper Galilee , injuring an unspecified number of Israeli fighters . RELATED Lebanon Hezbollah says fires rockets at Israeli position MENA Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged rocket fire along the Lebanese border for almost two weeks , following a strike by the Lebanese militia on Israel \" in solidarity \" with Hamas Operation al Aqsa Flood . Though the tit for tat exchanges have been limited to a few kilometers on either side of the border , the intensity of fighting has gradually ramped up . Neither Hezbollah nor Israel have signaled that they want a full scale war , but the expected Israeli ground invasion of Gaza is reportedly a red line for the Lebanese militia . Iran , Hezbollah backer , said last week that if there was a ground invasion into Gaza , it would use \" all resistance forces \" in the region against Israel . RELATED Israel to step up Gaza strikes as UN calls for ceasefire MENA Analysts have said the involvement of Hezbollah in the Gaza Israel war could pull other states like Iran and Syria into the fight , increasing the chances of a regional war .

On the Lebanese side of the border , residents have fled en masse to the nearby city of Tyre , as well as to the capital city of Beirut in anticipation of a greater escalation with Israel .',\n",

              " 'Do Rely on Law to Prevent Escalation in the Middle East Following the Palestinian militant organization Hamas attack on 7 , the government acted swiftly to dissuade other regional actors such as Hizballah or Iran from intervening in the latest round of Israeli Hamas hostilities . The attack killed over Israelis , mostly civilians , and resulted in another wounded , 102 of them seriously . Hamas also took over 200 hostages , which included a number of foreigners , including 26 children . In response , Israel initiated Operation Iron Swords , and as of 19 the military campaign , according to the Palestinian Health Authority independent figures are unavailable , has killed approximately Palestinians and wounded over , most of whom are civilians . The scale and brutality of Hamas attack and the intensity of Israel response , which far exceeds previous rounds of fighting in Gaza , have set the region on edge and raised fears about a multi front conflict and regional war , an outcome the United States is actively seeking to deter . In his remarks on the attacks , President Joseph Biden was blunt : Let me say again to any country , any organization , anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation , I have one word : Do . Do . Backing up the president words , the Pentagon approved a deployment extension for the USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group in the eastern Mediterranean and redirected a second , the USS Dwight Eisenhower carrier strike group , which is on a regularly scheduled deployment and is now headed to the Middle East . Additionally , reports suggest that the United States is preparing further naval reinforcements , including ships carrying upward of Marines , as a potential rapid reaction force . National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has indicated that the United States has conveyed its position to the government in Iran through diplomatic channels , and Western allies have also urged restraint in their own conversations with Iranian officials . Biden visit to Israel , an active war zone not controlled by the military , is somewhat unusual for an American president and represents a further effort at signaling to all the regional parties . Although the administration acknowledges the potential dangers of escalation , it is far from clear what might constitute potential triggers , much less responses or eventual endgames should deterrence fail . The potential for direct military involvement in a wider regional conflict is all too real , and an examination of the various vectors for potential escalation demonstrates how precarious the current moment is . Although Biden denied a report that the United States told Israel it would intervene in the event of a more serious conflict between Israel and Hizballah , other officials have carefully maintained ambiguity , whether as a further means of signaling deterrence or to keep open the underlying military option . The Biden administration should prepare for the possibility that deterrence alone may not prevent a wider conflict potentially involving the United States . As domestic law is unlikely to prevent America sliding into war , potentially without congressional authorization , action needs to be taken now to forestall entry into yet another Middle East war and a wider , destabilizing conflict . The government should urge Israel to pause its air attacks , continue to work on facilitating the movement of humanitarian aid in Gaza , and delay a ground offensive that appears imminent . This should lead to negotiations on further hostage releases and a full ceasefire . A Regional Tinderbox Should Israel pursue its stated objective of toppling Hamas and destroying its military capabilities through a potentially protracted ground invasion of Gaza , with all the civilian death and destruction that would inevitably entail , Hizballah may well step up attacks against Israel in the north , potentially initiating a cycle of escalation that could lead to full scale war . Alongside the fighting , the dire situation of civilians in Gaza is further compounded by the unfolding humanitarian crisis following Israel near total blockade of Gaza , which has meant that no food , fuel , or electricity is currently flowing to the besieged enclave . While the Israeli government announced the resumption of water supplies through one pipe reaching south Gaza , humanitarian organizations operating in the area have emphasized that this supply was temporary and wholly inadequate when compared to the needs of the entirety of Gaza . Egypt has been keen to resume normal operations at the Rafah border crossing , fearful of the potential spillover into North Sinai . Border operations were hampered by Israeli military actions and declarations that made clear that humanitarian convoys would not be allowed into Gaza . Following his meetings in Israel , President Biden indicated that he had reached an agreement to allow for humanitarian supplies to reach Gaza through Rafah . Operations were delayed because of an impasse over inspection modalities and the scope of humanitarian operations , but began fitfully over the weekend , although no fuel was allowed in . But the flow of aid is far below pre war levels and incommensurate with the massive and growing needs of Gaza populace . The images of human suffering produced by this conflict have already captivated the Arab world attention and generated outrage at the plight of the Palestinians . That crisis is set to deepen and will exert its own pressure on Hizballah , potentially compelling it to go beyond the limited action it has undertaken so far . There is also the looming danger of mass displacement of Palestinians from Gaza into North Sinai . While Egypt and other regional parties have expressed their vehement opposition to such an outcome , seeing it as creating potentially irreversible new facts on the ground , the logic of the war may push events in that direction . Alongside the fighting in Gaza , the situation in the West Bank also represents an additional escalation point that could impact the perceptions and judgments of Hizballah and others . The West Bank has been the scene of increasing violence over the course of the past year , marked by escalating attacks by Israeli settlers , often backed by the state . That period represents the deadliest year in decades for West Bank Palestinians , and in the days following the Hamas attack , there has been yet another spike in such violence , with Israeli forces and settlers killing more than 90 Palestinians in the last two weeks . But of course Hizballah and Israel are also locked in their own military conflict that has been contained by a fragile set of unwritten understandings that have come to define the rules of engagement between them . This modus vivendi has emerged through the periodic skirmishing that has defined this uneasy equilibrium since the ruinous 2006 war between the sides . So far these understandings about redlines that could trigger further escalation have held , but they are increasingly under pressure . Observers have largely assumed that mutual deterrence holds and that both Israel and Hizballah and its external ally , Iran seek to avoid a catastrophic repeat of the 2006 war , particularly in light of the current regional context and the possibilities for much wider and more protracted fighting this go around . But these assumptions may be misplaced , and regardless of the intentions of the parties , misjudgments and mistakes may inadvertently draw them into conflict . Regional Escalation Dynamics Escalation in one locale may also trigger actions farther afield , such as in Iraq and Syria , where interests and personnel may come up against militia actors linked with Iran . Indeed , on 17 and 18 , forces in Iraq and Syria were targeted with drones , piercing the relative lull of recent months . On 19 , a Navy destroyer in the Red Sea intercepted several cruise missiles and drones launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen , another armed group allied with Iran , which the military believes may have been aimed at Israel . Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin recently acknowledged that deterrence would become more complicated as the fight in Gaza becomes more protracted and bloody . It would be a mistake to understand signaling through rhetoric and deeds as a symbolic gesture . For the Biden administration , whose senior national security officials are all veterans of the Barack Obama administration and participants in the redline incident in Syria , perceptions of credibility would likely be a major consideration shaping crisis response . It is not particularly difficult to imagine escalatory dynamics that could push the United States to actually use the warplanes aboard its aircraft carriers to strike at Hizballah . Setting aside the reputational costs of engaging in such a military endeavor , military action would likely pose a practical dilemma for policymakers , similar to what Israel is running up with against Hamas in Gaza : While much stronger than the Palestinian group , Hizballah is still operating as a militia , with no military infrastructure such as airfields and barracks or heavy equipment like tanks and battleships that airstrikes could target and destroy . Its strongest asset , up to missiles and rockets including an unknown number of precision guided missiles that may be capable of wreaking massive damage on Israel infrastructure are presumably embedded in residential areas . Taking out these weapons would require precise intelligence , but as is often the case , airstrikes in urban areas lead to widespread destruction and inevitable civilian casualties . Notwithstanding the very real risks , domestic law is unlikely to serve as a significant hurdle preventing the Biden administration from taking the United States to armed conflict once again in the Middle East . Enabling legal doctrines and self judging lawyering within the executive branch provide the president substantial latitude to use military force without congressional authorization . And with passions understandably inflamed by Hamas unspeakable crimes , what many have dubbed Israel , Congress may be all too ready to give the executive branch whatever authorization it seeks . Under the prevailing executive branch legal theories , the president has considerable discretion to use military force even without congressional authorization . According to the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel , whether the president may unilaterally use force depends on a two part test a test repeatedly invoked by administration witnesses during a recent congressional hearing on the use of force . The president must be able to establish , first , that the use of force serves a national interest , and second , that the nature , scope , and duration of the anticipated hostilities will not rise to the level of war in the constitutional sense . The former prong , however , has been deemed to include everything from self defense to regional stabilization , rendering it close to meaningless . Amongst the most obvious potential national interests the president might cite to justify the use of military force in the event of a large scale Hizballah attack on Israel is the defense of nationals , given the presence of so many American citizens in Israel . Unsurprisingly , protection of nationals abroad has been the ostensible rationale for innumerable interventions over the last two centuries and indeed was part of the initial justification for the military campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant . The latter test prong , which is a safeguard against unilateral military action that by its nature , scope , and duration implicates , in the executive branch view , Congress Article I war powers , should in principle be more constraining . The Office of Legal Counsel has identified one particularly salient factor in reviewing whether an anticipated military operation amounts to this level of war in the constitutional sense : the risk of escalation . In assessing the risk of escalation , the Office of Legal Counsel has considered whether forces would suffer or inflict substantial casualties and thus has looked closely at the presence of ground troops given the difficulties of disengaging ground forces from situations of conflict , and the attendant risk that hostilities will escalate . Although the Biden administration has been clear that it has no plans to put boots on the ground in Israel , there are thousands of troops deployed elsewhere in the region including Iraq and Syria subject to potential retaliation , if not directly from Hizballah or Iran themselves , then by other Iran backed groups belonging to the so called Axis of Resistance . The presence of such ground troops and the attendant risk of escalation against the United States should therefore weigh heavily in assessing whether intervention would constitute war . In practice , however , this test has been applied unevenly by executive branch lawyers . Despite the risk to ground forces and likelihood of escalation , the Office of Legal Counsel blessed President Donald Trump killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani , which predictably led to Iranian retaliation against troops through ballistic missile strikes on Al Asad airbase in Iraq . Further , the statutory guardrail designed to prevent the president from taking the country to war unilaterally , the 1973 War Powers Resolution , has been largely gutted by aggressive executive branch interpretation , adverse court decisions , and congressional acquiescence . To be sure , the law still notionally requires the president to withdraw forces introduced into hostilities within 60 days , absent congressional authorization to continue fighting . But executive branch lawyers have read hostilities very narrowly for example , not to include waves of combat sorties flown against targets in Libya in 2011 and also showed a creative capacity to delay counting to 60 , as they did during the Tanker Wars of the . Moreover , even if the White House conceded that congressional authorization to fight Hizballah was necessary or at least politically prudent , it is entirely possible that Congress would vote for such a war . Hawkish members of Congress were already discussing potential use of force authorizations against Iranian backed groups even prior to Hamas massacre and kidnapping of civilians . Following the attack , the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , Michael McCaul R TX , announced that he has been drafting an authorization possible targeting groups such as Hamas , Hezbollah , and Iran backed militias . The overwhelming majority of legislators have rallied around Israel following the attack , and further escalation between Hizballah and Israel would likely further reinforce support on Capitol Hill . Considering the emotions of this current moment , it is entirely conceivable that a majority in Congress would vote for such a measure . Conclusion The United States risks being drawn into an escalatory spiral in the Middle East . Domestic law will not prevent this . The best hope is diplomacy . The Biden administration should take further steps now to prevent the conflict in Gaza from widening . Recognizing that counsel of restraint will be unwelcome , the United States should nonetheless urge Israel to pause its air attacks , continue to work on facilitating the movement of humanitarian aid in Gaza , and delay a ground offensive that already appears to be in advanced stages of planning . At that point , talks on the release of all hostages could be given more time to succeed while also providing the parties an opportunity to begin framing the contours of a full ceasefire . This can not be done without outside mediation , given the absence of direct contacts between Israel and Hamas . Qatar which reportedly played a role in the release of two hostages and Turkey , along with Egypt which also has extensive experience in this regard , are obvious candidates to play this role . The obvious counter to our argument is that the United States should not restrain Israel and that its own self restraint when attacked by Iranian backed groups invites more attack . However , dramatic actions to restore deterrence , such as the Trump administration strike on Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leader Qasem Soleimani , led not to deterrence but to immediate escalation with Iran , through retaliation against personnel . We believe that while military force is a useful tool for diplomacy , it is not the only one . The costs of either Israel or the United States embarking on an expanded or new conflict with no clear or readily obtainable objective outweigh the likely security benefits . The collateral effects of such an endeavor would likely be severe in terms of civilian casualties , regional stability , and interests . The failure to pause and instead proceed with a purely military solution could lead not only to a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and a dangerous , destabilizing escalation throughout the Middle East , but also to the United States once again going to war with no endgame . Secretary Austin recently invoked the lesson that you have to really think through next steps . Do operate on reflex activity . Think through what you going to do , what implications it going to have for the country , for the region and beyond . This is sound advice , and the Biden administration should follow its own admonitions . The White House needs to think now about how to prevent a worsening war in Gaza that draws Hizballah and even the United States into armed conflict . Military deterrence alone may prove insufficient . Brian Finucane is senior adviser with the Program at the International Crisis Group .

              " 'Behind Biden shift on Israel Hamas war : Gaza deaths , international pressure President Joe Biden has demonstrated unwavering support for Israel security over a half century in public life . In this photo , Biden attends a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , as he visits Israel amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas , in Tel Aviv , Israel , October 18 , 2023 . REUTERS Evelyn Acquire Licensing Rights Read more WASHINGTON , Oct 27 Reuters President Joe Biden and his team have markedly shifted their tone on the Israel Hamas crisis in recent days , moving from unfettered support of Israel to emphasizing the need to protect Palestinian civilians in Gaza ahead of a looming Israeli ground invasion . Biden has not changed his fundamental belief that Israel has the right and responsibility to defend itself in the aftermath of the 7 attack from Hamas militants that killed people in southern Israel , aides say . But a rapidly rising Palestinian death toll , the difficulty of freeing hostages held by Hamas and an increasingly vocal outcry from Arab nations , European allies and some Americans at home , have pushed Biden team to support a humanitarian pause to Israel attacks and focus on getting aid to Palestinians , say multiple sources inside the administration and out . A White House official said the shift in tone was based on \" the facts on the ground \" in Gaza with a humanitarian crisis worsening and the Biden team \" conversations with countries around the world . \" There has been a tug of war behind the scenes among Biden and his advisers about the message , said one former official who is in touch with current officials . \" We seen sort of an evolution from sort of full throated , unconditional hugging of Israel to a little bit more nuance , \" the former official said . The administration had not expected Palestinian casualties to mount as fast as they have now more than dead in Gaza , local officials say or for the humanitarian situation to deteriorate so rapidly , a official said on condition of anonymity . \" I think the framing has clearly changed , unsurprisingly , in response to changing circumstances and what appears to be an even greater looming catastrophe should the Israelis move into Gaza with a major campaign , \" said Aaron David Miller , a Middle East expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . Biden , 80 , has evolved in the face of a challenging 2024 reelection bid , threats by some would be supporters to withhold their votes over his lack of backing for Palestinians , and a warning from former President Barack Obama that Israel actions could backfire . Israeli officials and their supporters have privately voiced concern to Reuters that as more time passes since the 7 atrocities committed by Hamas , the more the world focus will be on death and destruction from the Israeli assault in Gaza . Biden aides are urging their Israeli counterparts to take more time to carefully think through their exit strategy before a full scale ground invasion , one source said . officials have cautioned that crafting fine points of such a strategy \" on the fly , \" as was often the case for the in the early stages of the Iraq war , would be a mistake , the source added . military advisers sent to the region are urging Israeli counterparts to be cautious because any invading force will face difficult fighting terrain and a warren of tunnels and booby trapped buildings that could increase casualties among Israeli soldiers and Gaza civilians , a separate source familiar with the conversations said . In rare comments on an active foreign policy crisis Obama , Biden Democratic predecessor and former boss , warned this week that Israel cutting off food and water to Gaza could \" harden Palestinian attitudes for generations . \" The White House did not respond when asked if the administration coordinated with Biden Democratic predecessor . ARAB LEADERS PRESSURE When Hamas militants burst out of Gaza and attacked southern Israel on 7 , Biden offered full throated support for Israel , saying he relayed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that \" Israel has the right to defend itself and its people . Full stop . \" He did not mention the Palestinian people . Addressing reporters before departing for the Middle East on 11 , Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the top objective of his trip was a robust show of solidarity with Israel , including providing all the military equipment that it needs to defend itself . \" The United States has Israel back , \" Blinken said . He did mention humanitarian aid at all . During Blinken six day trip , the death toll in Gaza soared from Israeli air strikes and concerns grew about food and water . Every Arab leader Blinken met in the region pressed him to urgently find a solution to the rapidly deteriorating situation in Gaza . Blinken relayed the concerns of Arab leaders , while others spoke to the president directly . The intense protests against Israel that followed last week blast at a Palestinian hospital , which the United States and Israel both blamed on Palestinian militants , also alarmed officials . The protests were reminders of the risks of escalation during any ground assault , officials said , because they show how Israel adversaries could seek to wield disinformation to spark unrest . HUMANITARIAN PAUSE The most rapid shift in policy has happened this week , to support a cessation in Israel attacks on Gaza to allow aid in and people to escape . Asked on 23 about international demands for a humanitarian pause , White House security spokesman John Kirby said the United States wants to make sure \" Israel has the tools it needs to defend itself and to go after Hamas and that humanitarian assistance keeps flowing . \" A day later , Kirby and Blinken advocated for one publicly . The shift followed a plea from Secretary General Antonio Guterres for civilians to be protected and increasingly desperate appeals from organizations to allow in aid . The revised its own resolution from a focus on Israel right to defend itself to include calls for all measures , specifically to include humanitarian pauses , to allow unhindered humanitarian access of aid . Remarks made by Biden on Wednesday are in contrast with those on 7 , and show a new direction . \" Israel has to do everything in its power , as difficult as it is , to protect innocent civilians , \" Biden told a press conference . He offered a rare criticism as well of Israel \" extremist settlers \" on the West Bank , accusing them of pouring gasoline on a fire , and called for a concentrated effort , once the crisis is over , to work toward an accord under which Israel and a new Palestinian state would exist side by side in peace . But Biden also expressed skepticism toward Palestinian estimates of the death toll and a continued staunch support of Israel . He told the press conference that he had \" no confidence \" in the numbers the Palestinians were using about Gaza dead .

Austin said he was placing additional troops on prepare to deploy orders , but did not say how many . The Pentagon has already placed some troops on a heightened state of readiness in case they need to deploy to the region . \" These steps will bolster regional deterrence efforts , increase force protection for US forces in the region , and assist in the defense of Israel , \" Austin added . The deployments come two years after Biden administration withdrew air defense systems from the Middle East , citing a reduction in tensions with Iran . The Patriot , considered one of the most advanced US air defense systems , is usually in short supply , with allies around the world vying for it . The THAAD system has a powerful radar . The US deployment of the system to South Korea in 2016 angered China , which believed it could peer into its airspace .

Wael Al Dahdouh lost his wife , son , daughter , and grandson when a blast hit a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza where the family was taking shelter after being displaced , according to the news organization . Al Dahdouh thanked viewers for their messages and calls following his family tragedy . The solidarity and prayers were certainly something very important for us but we thought it was necessary to return quickly despite everything , he said . The area is still burning , as you can see , from the raids and artillery bombardment . I saw that it was my duty , despite the pain and the bleeding wound , to return quickly and to meet you through the camera lens and social networking sites , he added . In an on air message on Wednesday , the Qatari funded news network wrote that Members of the family of our colleague Wael Al Dahdouh , including his wife , son , and daughter , were martyred in an Israeli bombing . Al Jazeera reported Al Dahdouh grandson Adam was declared dead two hours later . An emotional Al Dahdouh was seen in a video crying as he stood over his son body , wrapped in a white sheet . The distraught journalist was also seen carrying the small body of his grandson through al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Gaza . His son Mahmoud was 15 years old , and his daughter Sham was seven years old , Al Jazeera reported .

CNN can not independently confirm the source of the blast at the house , and Al Jazeera did not provide evidence linking it directly to an Israeli strike . The Israel Defense Forces IDF confirmed to CNN that it carried out an airstrike in an area of Gaza where Al Dahdouh relatives were killed on Wednesday . The IDF said that it was targeting Hamas terrorist infrastructure . Strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law , including the taking of feasible precautions to mitigate civilian casualties . Regarding this specific case , the IDF targeted Hamas terrorist infrastructure in the area , the IDF said in a statement . Israel leadership has vowed to wipe out Hamas , the Islamist group that controls Gaza , in response to its October 7 deadly terror attacks and kidnap rampage in which people , mostly civilians , were killed and more than 200 taken hostage . Its weeks long siege on Gaza has resulted in a humanitarian crisis inside the enclave , now cut off from the world by a near total blockade , say aid groups . Israeli airstrikes have decimated entire neighborhoods , leveling homes , schools , and mosques . CNN drone footage from Monday showed the level of destruction across parts of the strip , with whole streets flattened in the al Rimal neighborhood in Gaza City and a row of destroyed buildings known as al Zahra towers in central Gaza . More than people have been killed and a further injured in Israel sustained aerial bombardment of the crowded enclave , according to latest figures from the Hamas controlled health authorities in Gaza published by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah . Horrifying Advocacy groups condemned the death of Al Dahdouh family members on Wednesday . The International Press Institute IPI called it horrifying and outrageous news , in a statement . We condemn the killing of civilians and offer our deepest condolences to Wael Dahdouh .

Twenty of those killed are Palestinian , three are Israeli , and one is a Lebanese journalist , CPJ said . The figure includes Palestinian journalist Roshdi Sarraj , according to Palestinian press agency WAFA , which said he was killed in an Israeli airstrike . Sarraj was a fixer at French national public radio broadcaster Radio France and had been working with its correspondents since May 2021 , according to Radio France . When CNN reached out to the Israel Defense Forces IDF for comment on Sarraj death , it said on Monday that in stark contrast to Hamas intentional attacks on Israeli men , women and children , the IDF follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm .

These precision self defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups that began on October 17 . \" The military action comes amid rising tensions in the region over the conflict in Israel . Austin called the attacks separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas and said they do represent a shift in the approach to the conflict .

China vetoed the draft resolution , pointing out that the draft is seriously out of balance and confuses right and wrong . Photo : Xinhua A US backed draft resolution on the Israel Hamas conflict was vetoed for it did not reflect the world strongest calls for a ceasefire in Gaza , showing that the deadlock is deepening at the UN Security Council UNSC after several relevant drafts on the issue failed to pass in recent weeks . Some observers saw Washington as playing a proxy role for Israel , with an apparent long term biased view at the UNSC , impeding efforts to tackle the Israel Palestine issue . The resolution drafted by the US would have reaffirmed Israel right to self defense , urged respect for international laws especially protection of civilians and called for \" humanitarian pauses \" to deliver desperately needed aid to Gaza , the AP reported on Thursday . In Wednesday vote in the 15 member council , 10 countries voted in favor , Russia , China and the United Arab Emirates voted against . The resolution was not adopted because permanent council members Russia and China cast vetoes . The draft is seriously out of balance and confuses right and wrong , was introduced in haste and lacked the consensus it deserved , Zhang Jun , China permanent representative to the UN , said in an explanation of the vote . It does not reflect the world strongest calls for a ceasefire and an end to the fighting , and it does not help resolve the issue , Zhang said . The initial US text shocked many diplomats with its bluntness in stating Israel has a right to defend itself and demanding that Iran stop exporting arms to militant groups , Reuters said . It did not include a call for humanitarian pauses for aid access , according to the media report . After the failure of the US resolution , the UNSC voted on a Russian drafted text that called for a humanitarian ceasefire and withdrawal of Israel order for civilians in Gaza to relocate south ahead of a ground assault , Al Jazeera reported on Thursday . This was the second draft resolution led by Russia in two weeks , but was not adopted as it failed to secure the sufficient number of votes in favor . Earlier last week , a Brazil led draft resolution calling for humanitarian pauses for full and unhindered aid into Gaza , condemnation of violence against all civilians and rescission of Israel evacuation order failed to be adopted due to a veto by the a long history of divergences at the UN on the Palestine issue . The US has vetoed a number of resolutions in the past concerning Israeli occupation of some Palestinian territory or Israel massive retaliation that caused humanitarian crisis , Li Weijian , a research fellow with the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies , told the Global Times on Thursday . divergences delayed the resolution of the Israel Palestine issue , which also impeded the UN from playing its normal role , \" Li said , noting that the US veto of the Russia led resolution came out of intensifying geopolitical confrontation . Israeli ground forces operated within the northern Gaza Strip on Thursday , attacking multiple Hamas targets before withdrawing , Reuters reported . Given the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza , European Union leaders will call for the establishment of \" humanitarian corridors and pauses \" to get urgently needed aid into Gaza at a summit in Brussels on Thursday , the media report said . A video showing Wael Al Dahdouh , a journalist from the Al Jazeera , who lost his wife , son , daughter , and grandson in a reported Israeli airstrike on Wednesday , was circulating on Chinese social media on Thursday , grabbing the public attention on how severe the humanitarian crisis is now in Gaza . The Gaza conflict has gone through two stages , firstly the attack by Hamas on Israelis , and second Israel bombing of Gaza , but the US led resolution mainly focused on Israel \" right of self defense , \" Liu Zhongmin , a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University , told the Global Times on Thursday . In explaining China veto on the US led resolution , Zhang said the draft resolution attempts to establish a new narrative on the Palestine question , ignoring the fact that the Palestinian territory has been occupied for a long time and evading the fundamental issue of independent statehood for the Palestinian people . is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum , \" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said recently , who also accused Israel of clear violations of humanitarian law in the Gaza Strip . UNSC is now in an awkward position as it difficult for the five permanent members of the UNSC to achieve an agreement now . The US is playing the role of a proxy for Israel by only repeating its stances , \" Liu said , noting that this kind of bloc confrontation will dodge some key issues and prolong the Israel Palestine conflict . The top priority on the Palestine Israel issue is to cease fire , avoid humanitarian disasters , downgrade conflicts , and allow the UN to play its due role , Special Envoy of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun told a symposium on the Arab Chinese Relations and Dialogue between Arab and Chinese Civilizations recently . The solution to the Palestinian issue is a two state solution , which is to establish an independent Palestinian state and achieve peaceful coexistence between the Palestinians and Israel . The right way to advance the two country plan is to resume peace talks as soon as possible and allow various peace mechanisms to play a positive role , Zhai said . China position is based on facts and justice , responding to the strong appeal of the international community , especially the Arab countries , Mao Ning , spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry , told a press conference on Thursday . China has no selfish interests on the Palestinian question . China will firmly support anything conducive to peace , and will exert its utmost to do anything conducive to the reconciliation between Palestine and Israel , she said . On Thursday , the China International Development Cooperation Agency announced it would provide another 15 million yuan million in emergency humanitarian supplies to the Gaza Strip to help those affected by the conflict , given the deteriorating humanitarian situation . The Chinese government recently provided 1 million in cash assistance through the Palestinian National Authority and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East . Experts said there is still a possibility for a ceasefire , especially with the US and Israel facing pressure globally and domestically , which will force Washington to exert some influence on Israel . Israel is the politically correct stance in the US , especially as the Biden administration is also facing pressure from pro Israel Republicans as elections loom , so it has to demonstrate its firm support , \" Li said . But as the conflict continues , the US needs to consider the international pressure that Israel is facing and how it will interact with Arab countries in the future , which could provide some possibilities for a future ceasefire when Israel stated targets are reached , he added .',\n",
              " 'Friends or foes ? Where Israel Middle Eastern neighbours stand on its war against Hamas Israel has normalised relations with two of its direct neighbours , while several other states and groups in the Middle East are seen as hostile to , or outright enemies of , the Jewish state . Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian warned Israel that the Middle East could spiral out of control if Israel does not stop strikes on Gaza that started in response to attacks by Hamas militants on 7 October . \" I warn the US and its proxy Israel that , if they do not immediately stop the crime against humanity and genocide in Gaza , anything is possible at any moment and the region will go out of control , \" Amir Abdollahian said at a news conference in Tehran on Monday . Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian warned the US and Israel to stop attacks on Gaza , saying that if they do there will be many consequences and chaos in the region . Source : AAP Abedin Taherkenareh EPA Former Australian ambassador to Lebanon Ian Parmeter told SBS News that Iran does not control the Middle East and can not convince many actors in the region to do what it wants . But many countries in the region share support for the Palestinian people , though not Hamas militants , he said . Sally Totman is a Middle East specialist at Charles Sturt University . She said conflicts in the region have historically involved neighbours being dragged into disputes with other neighbours . She said governments of countries such as Egypt , Jordan and Lebanon are walking a very fine line at the moment in disagreeing with Israel treatment of Palestinians but also protecting their own interests and keeping a distance from Hamas . \" I think there zero support for Hamas attacking civilians , kidnapping civilians . I think there zero support anywhere in the world for that kind of behaviour , \" she said . Here a look at how Israel neighbours have responded to the Hamas Israel war , in which over Palestinians and Israelis have so far reportedly been killed . Iran On 15 October , Iran UN mission assured the world that its armed forces would intervene in the conflict unless Israel attacked Iranian interests or citizens . Iran , a longtime backer of Gaza rulers Hamas , finds itself in a quandary as it tries to manage the spiralling crisis , nine Iranian officials with direct knowledge of the thinking within the clerical establishment told Reuters . Standing on the sidelines in the face of an all out Israeli invasion of Gaza would significantly set back an Iranian strategy for regional ascendancy pursued for over four decades , according to the people , who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the discussions in Tehran . Yet any major attack against a US backed Israel could exact a heavy toll on Iran and trigger public anger against the clerical rulers in a nation already mired in an economic crisis , said the officials , who outlined the various military , diplomatic and domestic priorities being weighed by the establishment . Three security officials said a consensus had been reached among Iran top decision makers , for now : Give their blessing for limited cross border raids by its Lebanese proxy group Hezbollah on Israeli military targets , over 200 km away from Gaza , as well as low level attacks on US targets by other allied groups in the region . Israelis evacuate a site struck by a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip , in Ashkelon , southern Israel . Source : AP Ohad Zwigenberg The plan is also to prevent any major escalation that would draw Iran itself into the conflict . \" We are in contact with our friends Hamas , Islamic Jihad , and Hezbollah , \" Vahid Jalalzadeh , the head of the Iranian parliament National Security Committee said on Wednesday , according to Iranian state media . \" Their stance is that they do not expect us to carry out military operations . \" Hamas is a Palestinian military and political group , gaining power in the Gaza Strip since winning legislative elections there in 2006 . Its stated aim is to establish a Palestinian state , while refusing to recognise Israel right to exist . Hamas , in its entirety , is designated as a terrorist organisation by countries including Australia , Canada , the UK and the US . Some countries list only its military wing as a terrorist group . Lebanon Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire over the Israel Lebanon border with increasing frequency since 7 October and the situation has become tense , with Australians being told not to travel to Lebanon and many in the Lebanese diaspora fearing for their relatives . On Sunday , Hezbollah announced the deaths of six of its fighters , raising to 26 the number of its members killed in the worst escalation in violence along the frontier since Israel and the Iran backed group fought a war in 2006 . Hezbollah is a Lebanese Islamist political party and militant group formed in 1982 after Israeli forces invaded southern Lebanon that year . It is backed by Iran and leads a multi party alliance that holds just under half the seats in Lebanon parliament . Hezbollah is listed as a terrorist organisation by countries including Australia , the US , Germany and the UK . The European Union lists only its military wing as a terrorist organisation . However , Hezbollah itself makes no distinction between its political and military wings . There a major distinction between the Lebanese government and Hezbollah , Totman said . \" The Lebanese state and the majority of Lebanese absolutely do want to have conflict with Israel , it never ends well for them . Hezbollah certainly does speak for the majority of the Lebanese population but Lebanon does have a functioning government . \" Hezbollah runs an enclave within a state . So even if other parties wanted to stop Hezbollah , there no way of doing it . Lebanon has got its own political catastrophe , and economic catastrophe , so in short , Hezbollah does what it likes . \" She said the amount of rockets launched by Hezbollah is \" very minimal \" . \" Yes , they sending some missiles over the border to say we ideologically support the Palestinians and are taking attention and resources away from bombing Gaza . But they not doing enough to warrant a huge response from Israel . \" Israel has warned it will hit back very hard against Hezbollah , which has said it is fully ready to contribute to the conflict \" when the time comes . \" Parmenter said : \" Hezbollah has about militants but how effective they would be against an organised Israeli army with high tech weapons and support from the US , I not sure . \" Syria Rockets have also been launched from Syria into Israel in recent weeks . Syria has ties with Iran and may be compelled to follow Iran course of action but Israel has already warned Syria not to get involved by bombing Aleppo and Damascus airports on Sunday , Parmeter said . \" The main purpose of that bombing is probably to prevent Iran sending munitions and rockets , to Hezbollah , through Syria . \" I do think Syria is likely to get directly involved . They still have recovered from the civil war which began in 2011 , and Iran would want them to suffer a destabilising ground invasion by Israel , \" he said . Egypt Egypt shares a border with the Gaza Strip and controls the Rafah border crossing , where limited aid has finally been able to get to Palestinians running out of water , fuel and food under an Israeli blockade . But Egypt has said it wo take in Palestinian refugees from Gaza . Egypt foreign affairs minister has cited the \" economic burden \" and not wanting to solely bear the \" responsibility \" . The country has long been considered a \" moderate Arab state \" and is walking a diplomatic tightrope at the moment , Totman said . Egypt has had a peace treaty with Israel since 1979 . \" Egypt and Jordan have got long established diplomatic and economic relations and limited political relations with Israel . READ MORE What is the Rafah border crossing in Gaza and why is it blocked ? \" They also share borders with Israel , so their role is particularly important in stabilising the situation . \" Jordan Jordan has had a formal peace agreement with Israel since 1994 and is playing a similar negotiating role to Egypt , Totman said . \" We do tend to talk about it as much but Egypt and Jordan are both each benefactors of American aid , which is really a reward for the peace that they keep with Israel . \" Last week Jordan cancelled a summit with US President Joe Biden after an explosion at the al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City killed hundreds .',\n",
              " 'Are Facebook , Instagram ruining mental health of your kids ? Many US states believe so Several US states are concerned that the mental health of its young users are under threat from social media platforms . Over 40 US states have sued Meta for platforms like Facebook and Instagram . They claim that the social media company is knowingly and deliberately hurting the mental condition of children . The platforms , owned by Meta , have been accused of designing features that could potentially harm children mental health . According to the complainants , Meta has harnessed powerful and unprecedented technologies to entice , engage , and ultimately ensnare youth and teens . Its motive is profit , and in seeking to maximize its financial gains , Meta has repeatedly misled the public about the substantial dangers of its social media platforms , the complaint says . It has concealed the ways in which these platforms exploit and manipulate its most vulnerable consumers : teenagers and children . The lawsuit further claims that Kids and teenagers are suffering from record levels of poor mental health and social media companies like Meta are to blame , said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement . Meta has profited from children pain by intentionally designing its platforms with manipulative features that make children addicted to their platforms while lowering their self esteem . Meta responded to the accusations by claiming that it is disappointed with the case . In a statement it said that it is on the side of the attorney generals who have formulated the case against Meta Instagram and Facebook . To justify that , Meta has claimed it has introduced over 30 tools just to support teens and families . Meta stated , We disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear , age appropriate standards for the many apps teens use , the attorney generals have chosen this path . But what does the research say ? A study conducted at the University of Pennsylvania found that high usage of Facebook , Snapchat , and Instagram increases feelings of loneliness . The research suggests that limiting social media usage to around 30 minutes a day can lead to significant improvement in well being . In September 2021 , a report by the Wall Street Journal leaked an internal document authored by Facebook own researchers . In the presentation , they acknowledged that Instagram can make teenagers feel worse about their bodies . In fact , 32 of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies , Instagram made them feel worse . One of its internal studies found that of teen girls said Instagram made suicidal thoughts worse , and 17 of teen girls said it made eating disorders worse . A US state has a unique solution to this problem . Utah became the first US state to require social media firms to get parental consent for children to use their apps and verify users are at least 18 . The state has also imposed a social media curfew that blocks children access between and unless adjusted by their parents . How can you protect kids and teens from the ill effects of Social Media ?

              " 'Israeli troops launch brief ground incursion into Gaza to prepare battlefield Israeli troops and tanks launched a brief ground raid into northern Gaza overnight into Thursday , the military said , striking several militant targets in order to prepare the battlefield \" ahead of a widely expected ground invasion after more than two weeks of devastating air raids . Israeli armoured vehicles take part in an operation , as the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues , at a location given as the northern Gaza REUTERS The raid came after the UN warned it is on the verge of running out of fuel in the Gaza Strip , forcing it to sharply curtail relief efforts in the territory , which has also been under a complete siege since Hamas bloody rampage across southern Israel ignited the war earlier this month . Hospitals in Gaza struggled to treat masses of wounded with dwindling resources . Health officials said the death toll was soaring as Israeli jets pounded Gaza . Workers pulled dead and wounded civilians , including many children , out of landscapes of rubble in cities across the territory . Gaza Health Ministry , which is controlled by Hamas , said Wednesday that more than 750 people were killed over the past 24 hours , higher than the 704 killed the previous day . The Associated Press could not independently verify the death toll , and the ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants . The Israeli military , which accuses Hamas of operating among civilians , said its strikes killed militants and destroyed military targets . Gaza militants have fired unrelenting rocket barrages into Israel since the conflict started . During the overnight raid , the military said soldiers struck fighters , militant infrastructure and anti tank missile launching positions . There were no immediate reports of casualties on either aide . The rising death tolls in Gaza are unprecedented in the decades long Israeli Palestinian conflict . Even greater loss of life could come if Israel launches an expected ground offensive aimed at crushing Hamas , which has ruled Gaza since 2007 and survived four previous wars with Israel . The Gaza Health Ministry says more than Palestinians have been killed in the war . That figure includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week . The fighting has killed more than people in Israel , mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack , according to the Israeli government . Hamas also holds some 222 hostages in Gaza . The warning by the agency for Palestinian refugees , UNRWA , over depleting fuel supplies raised alarm that the humanitarian crisis could quickly worsen . Gaza population has also been running out of food , water and medicine . About million of Gaza million residents have fled their homes , with nearly half of them crowded into shelters . In recent days , Israel let a small number of trucks with aid enter from Egypt but barred deliveries of fuel needed to power generators saying it believes Hamas will take it . UNRWA has been sharing its own fuel supplies so that trucks can distribute aid , bakeries can feed people in shelters , water can be desalinated , and hospitals can keep incubators , life support machines and other vital equipment working . If it continues doing all of that , fuel will run out by Thursday , so the agency is deciding how to ration its supply , UNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai told The Associated Press . Do we give for the incubators or the bakeries ? she said . It is an excruciating decision . More than half of Gaza primary health care facilities and roughly a third of its hospitals have stopped functioning , the World Health Organization said . At Gaza City al Shifa Hospital , the lack of medicine and clean water have led to alarming infection rates , the group Doctors Without Borders said . Amputations are often required to prevent infection from spreading in the wounded , it said . One surgeon with the group described amputating half the foot of a 9 year old boy with only slight sedation on a hallway floor as his mother and sister watched . The conflict has also threatened to spread across the region . The Israeli military said it struck military sites in Syria in response to rocket launches from the country . Syrian state media said eight soldiers were killed and seven wounded . Strikes in Syria also hit the airports of Aleppo and Damascus , in an apparent attempt to prevent arms shipments from Iran to militant groups , including Lebanon Hezbollah . Israel has been exchanging near daily fire with Iranian backed Hezbollah across the Lebanese border . Hamas surprise rampage on 7 in southern Israel stunned the country with its brutality , its unprecedented toll and the failure of intelligence agencies to know it was coming . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech Wednesday night that he will be held accountable , but only after Hamas was defeated . We will get to the bottom of what happened , \" he said . \" This debacle will be investigated . Everyone will have to give answers , including me . Israel ambassador , Gilad Erdan , said his country will stop issuing visas to personnel after Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that Hamas attack did not happen in a vacuum . It was unclear what the action , if implemented , would mean for aid personnel working in Gaza and the West Bank . It time to teach them a lesson , Erdan told Army Radio , accusing the chief of justifying a slaughter . The chief told the Security Council on Tuesday that the Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation . Guterres said the grievances of the Palestinian people can not justify the appalling attacks by Hamas . And those appalling attacks can not justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people . Guterres said Wednesday he is shocked at the misinterpretation of his statement as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas . This is false . It was the opposite , he told reporters .',\n",

              " 'Macron proposal to fight Hamas with anti ISIS coalition not practical , experts say Live updates : Follow the latest news on Israel Gaza French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested the international coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria could be expanded to also target Hamas in the Gaza Strip . Several experts have told The National the proposal is unrealistic , as it would quickly alienate Arab countries and lead to divisions in the alliance made up of 81 nations . Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Tuesday , Mr Macron said France was ready for the global coalition against ISIS to also fight against Hamas . Israel is not part of the anti ISIS coalition , which was established to fight ISIS in September 2014 , though its Arab neighbours such as Lebanon , Jordan and Egypt are . Analysts said while greater international co operation was needed to address urgent matters such as aid delivery to Gaza , hostage talks and ceasefire negotiations , any attempt to use coalition resources to strike Hamas in Gaza would promptly lead to friction . The idea that the international community should form a coalition to fight Hamas is just about the worst possible idea on the table , said Charles Lister , a senior fellow and director of the Syria and Countering Terrorism and Extremism programmes at the Middle East Institute . It would further exacerbate tensions , widen regional divisions and virtually guarantee the regional escalation that everyone wants to avoid . Karim Emile Bitar , associate research fellow at the Institute for International and Strategic Affairs in Paris , said any expansion of the anti ISIS coalition was very unlikely to happen . What is absolutely needed , however , is an increasing multilateral co operation and efforts on behalf of all regional and international powers to insist on the respect of humanitarian law and ideally call for an immediate ceasefire , he said . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embraces French President Emmanuel Macron after their joint press conference in Jerusalem on Tuesday . AFP The anti ISIS coalition was created after militants stormed across Iraq and Syria in 2014 , carrying out murderous atrocities as they claimed large parts of both countries to be their new caliphate . Mr Netanyahu has compared Hamas , whose armed wing killed people in southern Israel on October 7 , to ISIS . Hadi Jalo Marie , chairman of the Political Decision think tank in Baghdad , highlighted the many differences between the two groups . ISIS is a cross border terrorist organisation that includes extremists of different nationalities and threatens all countries , including the West , he said . Hamas is a Palestinian group that fights only Israel inside Palestine , not in other countries , he added , noting there could be negative reactions to Mr Macron suggestion from many countries except Israel and some of its allies . Jordanian counter terrorism specialist Saud Al Sharafat said it was unclear whether Mr Macron had discussed the issue with Washington before making the announcement in Israel . The French always like to come with a distinctive suggestion , Mr Al Sharafat said . He pointed out several Arab countries opposed to the current Israeli military operations in Gaza are members of the anti ISIS coalition . The immediate effect of what Macron envisages could be the break up of the coalition , said Mr Al Sharafat , who heads the Shorufat Centre for Globalisation and Terrorism Studies in Amman . James Jeffrey , former US special envoy to Syria and chairman of the Wilson Centre Middle East Programme , said Mr Macron idea was a good one in spirit , but in practical terms it wo work . The French leader suggestion recognises as US , Europe and Asian allies did in the case of Ukraine that we are facing a common threat to the international order and should respond , Mr Jeffrey said . But the coalition is made up of nations and organisations with differing views of Hamas , Israel and the Palestinian question , he added . For any expanded coalition to work , Israel would have to shift position on the Palestinians , Mr Jeffrey said . At least lip service to the two state solution and an absolute , no exception halt to settlements and settlement growth . The latest from the Israel Gaza war in pictures APTOPIX Israel Palestinians Palestinians look for survivors of Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip at Nusseirat refugee camp . AP Joel Rayburn , founder and director of the American Centre for Levant Studies , said the Israel Gaza conflict was so closely related to the broader Israeli Palestinian political question that it would be supremely difficult to replicate a narrowly focused counter terrorism coalition modelled on the counter ISIS alliance . The campaign against the ISIS caliphate did not directly involve any broader political questions , only military plans , he noted .',\n",

IDF airstrikes kill top Hamas commander The Israeli Air Forces on Wednesday said it took out top Hamas commander Taysir Mubasher in an airstrike in the Gaza Strip .

              " 'Israel Hamas War is inching nations closer to World War 3 How it will impact India Israel is not holding back when it comes to taking revenge on the terror organization Hamas . It has bombed many locations in the Gaza Strip , including civilian neighborhoods , with the goal of hitting the group military bases . On october 7 , the Palestinian organization carried out a significant terror strike on Israeli land . The Israeli Defence Force IDF has carried out a complex sequence of missile attacks throughout Gaza , demolishing thousands of Gazans houses in addition to murdering thousands of Hamas operatives . israel came under fire after a hospital explosion in Gaza that claimed over 500 lives and for which it failed to accept responsibility . Many actions might cause the Middle east conflict to escalate into a full fledged World war 3 , as nations demonstrate their positions on the Israel Hamas conflict through their audacious political declarations . It is anticipated that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu would take advantage of his positive relationships with a number of nations , including the united states and the United Kingdom , given that militant organizations in iran and lebanon have already intervened to aid palestine and Hamas in their battle against Israel . It is anticipated that the number of Gaza victims will continue to rise as israel promises retaliation for the assaults on July 10 and 11 . Arab nations including Egypt , Syria , Saudi Arabia , and others that have hitherto supported palestine are anticipated to respond sharply to this . The US government is already giving israel weaponry and assistance for war victims , but once Arab countries unite against israel , they will probably become more involved . India , the nation longtime ally , is also prepared to intervene by extending its military and defense capabilities . If this fight escalates into World war 3 , the 900 indian soldiers now stationed at the Israel Lebanon data border under UNIFIL will be in the direct line of fire . The indian economy is predicted to suffer greatly in the event of World war Three as it would need to supply food , medicine , and weaponry to israel in order to keep bilateral relations intact . Furthermore , the indian economy would be severely damaged by the general increase in global inflation and crude oil prices , which will result in record high gasoline costs and a shortage of essential goods .',\n",
              " 'Not fit to lead UN : Israeli envoy demands resignation of Antonio Guterres over remarks on war Israel Ambassador to the United Nations , Gilad Erdan , has demanded the resignation of the organisation Secretary General Antonio Guterres , saying that he is \" not fit to lead the UN \" and is showing understanding for a \" campaign of mass murder \" . Taking to social media platform X , Erdan said , \" The UN Secretary General , who shows understanding for the campaign of mass murder of children , women , and the elderly , is not fit to lead the UN . I call on him to resign immediately . \" \" There is no justification or point in talking to those who show compassion for the most terrible atrocities committed against the citizens of Israel and the Jewish people . There are simply no words , \" the envoy continued . In an earlier post , Erdan alleged that Guterres was \" completely disconnected \" from the reality in Israel and that the UN chief viewed the attacks by Hamas in a \" distorted and immoral manner \" . \" His statement that , the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum , expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder . It really unfathomable . It truly sad that the head of an organization that arose after the Holocaust holds such horrible views . A tragedy ! \" Erdan added . After Erdan post , Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said that he would not meet with Guterres on the sidelines of the UN Security Council meeting . \" I will not meet with the UN Secretary General . After the October massacre , there is no place for a balanced approach . Hamas must be erased off the face of the planet ! \" he said on Addressing the UN Security Council session on the Israel Gaza crisis , Cohen said , \" Mr Secretary General Guterres , in what world do you live ? Definitely , this is not our world \" . Reiterating Israel stance to vanquish the militant organisation , the Israeli Foreign Minister said that the only \" proportional response \" to Hamas attacks is the \" total destruction \" of the group . \" This is the world we live Secretary General . We gave Palestinians Gaza till the last millimetre . There is no dispute to the length of Gaza , but they take the money from the world and instead of building hospital , office buildings they built tunnels to dug tunnels to build rocket factory , \" Cohen said . What did Guterres say ? According to BBC , Guterres came out in support of Palestine at a meeting of the UNSC on Tuesday and said that the brutal Hamas attack on October 7 \" did not happen in a vacuum \" . \" The Palestinian people been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation . They have seen their lands steadily devolved by settlements and plagued by violence . Their economy stifled . Their people displaced and their homes demolished . Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing , \" he said at the UNSC meeting . Guterres said that the protection of civilians is paramount and expressed concern about \" clear violations of international humanitarian law \" in Gaza , without mentioning either Hamas or Israel by name . However , he also said that the situation in Palestine does not justify the Hamas attack and \" those appalling attacks can not justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people \" . US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged member states of the UN to not \" throw fuel on the fire \" and send a united message to stop other countries from further exacerbating the Israel Hamas conflict . Advertisement \" All acts of terrorism are unlawful and unjustifiable . Whether they target people in Nairobi or Bali , in Mumbai , New York or Kibbutz unlawful and unjustifiable whether they carried out by ISIS , by Boko Haram , by Lashkar E Taiba , or by Hamas , \" Blinken said , adding that at least 33 American citizens have been killed in the conflict . \" This council has a responsibility to denounce member states that arm , fund and train Hamas or any other terrorist group that carries out such horrific acts , \" Blinken further said . Advertisement The worsening situation in Gaza The Hamas attack on October 7 killed people , following which Israel unleashed relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip in their attempts to root out and kill Hamas militants . According to Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al Maliki , over Palestinians have been killed , including children and women . \" More injustice and more killing will not make Israel safer . No amount of weapons , no alliance will bring to its security . Only peace will , peace with Palestine and its people . Our freedom is the condition of shared peace and security It must be clear that this can only be achieved by putting an immediate end to the Israeli war launched against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip , \" he said in the UNSC meeting . The Hamas run Health Ministry said that Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have killed at least 704 people in the past day , representing a massive increase in the death count . Over people have been wounded . Gaza million people have been running out of food , water and medicine since Israel sealed off the territory following the attack by Hamas . An expected ground offensive in Gaza is believed to have even more devastating humanitarian consequences . Israel on Tuesday said that it had launched 400 airstrikes over the past day , killing Hamas commanders , hitting militants as they were preparing to launch rockets into Israel and striking command centers and a Hamas tunnel shaft . The previous day , Israel reported 320 strikes . One overnight strike leveled a four story residential building in the southern city of Khan Younis , killing at least 32 people and wounding dozens of others , according to survivors . Hamas militants have released two Israeli hostages out of the 222 captives abducted on October 7 . According to a report by the Jerusalem Post , the two women were identified as Nurit Cooper , 80 , and Yocheved Lifshitz , 85 , both from Kibbutz Nir Oz and were released from Gaza to Egypt on Monday night . The militant organisation said that they had decided to release the two elderly women for \" humanitarian \" and health reasons . \" We decided to release them for compelling humanitarian and health reasons , \" the media reported quoted Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida as saying . Hamas apparently received nothing in exchange for the release of the two hostages , who were freed days after an American woman and her teenage daughter .

              " 'The law limits Israel response to Hamas The appalling nature of the 7 Hamas attack on Israeli civilians , killing more than , abducting at least 200 , and firing rockets indiscriminately into civilian neighborhoods , has understandably prompted an Israeli military response . It has also prompted passionate discussions on campus . I urge Princeton students attempting to make sense of the conflict to look at the unfolding situation through the lens of international humanitarian law IHL . That law , which makes it a war crime for Hamas to target civilians , also restricts how Israel wages war . Those limits apply regardless of the justice of Israel decision to take military action . They are unconditional requirements , not contingent on the behavior of the other side . The most serious violations are subject to prosecution by the International Criminal Court , whose involvement is urgently needed . ADVERTISEMENT The Israeli military and its supporters like to say that , unlike Hamas , Israel does not deliberately target civilians . But IHL requires far more a series of steps designed to spare civilians as much as possible from the hazards of war . Israel compliance with these broader requirements has been spotty . IHL was codified in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their additional protocols of 1977 . The key provisions are also part of customary international law . They apply to all warring parties , whether governmental or not . Although these requirements consume hundreds of pages , their essence is straightforward . In addition to prohibiting deliberate attacks on civilians , IHL requires attacking forces not to fire indiscriminately into civilian areas even if legitimate military targets can be found there . The Israeli military flattening of certain Gaza neighborhoods appears to violate this rule . IHL also requires warring parties to refrain from attacking even a legitimate military target if the anticipated civilian harm will be disproportionate a rule that the Israeli military destruction of large apartment buildings , rendering hundreds of families homeless , seems to violate . In the past , the Israeli military has cited a Hamas presence in these large complexes to justify the destruction , but it is hard to see how the military advantage justifies the enormous civilian cost . The point seems to be the destruction . In addition , warring parties are required to allow humanitarian aid to civilians in need . But immediately after 7 , the Israeli government blocked all food , water , medicine , fuel , and electricity to the million people of Gaza an act of prohibited collective punishment . By 21 , a trickle of food , water , and medicine was being allowed in , but nowhere near the 100 trucks per day that the United Nations says is required . Nor had the Israeli military allowed in the fuel needed to run desalination plants and the generators that hospitals require to treat the many civilians injured by Israeli bombing . Finally , IHL requires warring parties to give effective advance warning of an attack if possible to enable civilians to flee . But Israel evacuation order for the million civilians of northern Gaza made a mockery of the humane purpose of this requirement , because the Israeli military continued to bomb southern Gaza as well as the route to get there , and Israel siege left southern Gaza with no resources to receive this huge influx of people . The Israeli military is also threatening that civilians who do not flee northern Gaza may be identified as a partner in a terrorist organization . That is what Israel did in southern Lebanon in 2006 against Hezbollah before attacking and killing civilians who remained . But there are many reasons that civilians do not flee poverty , disability , fear , or simply a reluctance to leave their homes . None of that turns them into a legitimate military target . ADVERTISEMENT The Israeli military and its backers like to cite Hamas use of civilians as human shields to justify the large civilian toll in Gaza , but that is an inadequate defense . IHL does prohibit using the presence of civilians to deter an attack , and it requires warring parties to take all feasible precautions to spare civilians . But even when Hamas violates these provisions , the duty remains on the attacker Israel to refrain from firing if the rules against indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks are violated . These are not pie in the sky rules concocted by human rights groups or pacifists . They were written by the world leading militaries , including the United States . These are not nice rules to follow until the going gets tough they are designed for a nation most trying circumstances , when its troops are at war and its citizens are being killed . They reflect an evolution from the total war approach to armed conflict in which an opponent civilian population was viewed as fair game . That , for example , is how Russian President Vladimir Putin has fought wars in Chechnya , Syria , and Ukraine , but few embrace that approach . These rules also have a pragmatic dimension targeting an opponent military is the best way to deploy scarce military resources . In addition , in the case of Gaza , it is the best way for the Israeli military to avoid inflaming the civilian population , leaving it determined to replicate Hamas even if the current leadership is killed or captured . Get the best of the Prince delivered straight to your inbox . Subscribe now Hamas has no record of prosecuting its war criminals , and Israel has a poor record , but the International Criminal Court ICC provides a new option . Israel has never joined the ICC , but since 2021 , the ICC has had an open investigation of the Situation in the State of Palestine , meaning any war crime committed in the occupied territory or by a national of that territory . Palestine was able to join the court because in 2012 , the General Assembly accepted it as a non member observer state . That a state can subject its own nationals to ICC jurisdiction is uncontroversial . Yet for years , the government opposed the ICC ability to prosecute crimes on the territory of an ICC member state if the alleged perpetrator government had not joined the court . That was the basis for President Donald Trump outrageous imposition of sanctions on former ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda for opening investigations in Afghanistan which might have implicated torturers there and Palestine which could ensnare Israeli officials . But the Biden administration lifted those sanctions and has now even abandoned that objection by applauding the ICC charges against Putin for alleged war crimes in Ukraine . Ukraine has conferred jurisdiction , but Russia has not joined the court . Even so , the current ICC chief prosecutor , Karim Khan , undoubtedly wary of Washington reaction , has been slow walking the Palestine investigation since he took office in June 2021 . That ongoing impunity can only encourage more war crimes . I hope the surge of war crimes by both sides in Gaza will light a fire under the ICC prosecutor office to promptly investigate and file charges for war crimes . There may be no situation anywhere that elicits more discord and debate on the Princeton campus than the decades long Israeli Palestinian conflict . Finding a political solution has proven extraordinarily difficult . But we should all be able to agree on the importance of both sides respecting IHL . That will reduce the civilian toll and enhance the prospect of someday finding a solution .

We also call on the parties to the conflict to avoid any targeting of health and education facilities , which allows us to deliver the aid safely to the health facilities and everywhere that they are needed , he said . Hopkins spoke to UN News several hours after the convoy passed through the Rafah crossing in southern Egypt , where hundreds more trucks are waiting should the border open up again . He paid tribute to the dedicated UNICEF team on the ground who continue to serve under fire , and discussed the prospects for additional aid convoys . This interview has been edited for clarity . Jeremy Hopkins : Today we were able to include two UNICEF trucks in the convoy with drinking water , litres . It a drop in the ocean literally , almost and that will allow us to reach about people with one day supply of drinking water . So , a very , very small amount went through today which reinforces the urgent need to have a sustained humanitarian corridor that is open for supplies . And , of course , we hope that there will be additional border posts opening so that the necessary supplies can get in . UN News : Do you have any information about the next delivery and what that depends on ? Do you also have additional emergency supplies in place once the next delivery is given the green light ? Jeremy Hopkins : So , we have quite a good pipeline of water and water systems equipment , medicine and health systems equipment , and a number of other specialized items for child protection and childcare . We have , I think , 12 trucks loaded on stand by at the border that can be crossed over in a matter of hours the next time it opens . And we have a pipeline sort of coming in by plane and by truck from Cairo and from international destinations with more medical supplies , more waterworks , water systems supplies . Because we know that the priorities in Gaza right now are water , food , medicine and fuel , and so we are prioritizing our pipeline accordingly . We have one million bottles of drinking water in the pipeline ready , just for example , so we have big quantities of the necessary materials . We just need the corridor to be open on a sustained , continuous basis . UN News : Is there any information about the next delivery ? Jeremy Hopkins : We know that the authorities and the different parties are continuing to discuss how to manage this border in a more sustainable way , and we have every hope that they will do so . I think the details will become clearer as they become clear . UN News UNICEF Representative in Egypt Jeremy Hopkins UN News : We now have 20 trucks inside Gaza . What are the arrangements and preparations inside the Gaza Strip to deliver the lifesaving supplies ? Jeremy Hopkins : I want to first recognize that we have a very dedicated team of UNICEF State of Palestine staff in Gaza who have been working day and night under terrible , terrible conditions to deliver assistance . So , assistance has been ongoing since the beginning and , of course , prior to this particular terrible , terrible round of conflict . I know that our colleagues in Gaza have been repositioning the health centres with pre positioned medical supplies , keeping some of the water systems running . I know we are down to five per cent of the normal capacity , but there are some water systems running . The only desalination plant that is still going is done so with UNICEF support . So , our colleagues and I want to pay tribute to them are doing a fantastic job in Gaza . What we know about the evolving needs is there are one million people displaced . We know that at least children are displaced . That means they have no home right now or they are not at home , and that means that the humanitarian needs are extremely urgent . For example , according to international standards , each person should have 15 litres of water to live in health and dignity that drinking and washing and cooking and everything else . Right now , it down to a little less than three litres of water per person in Gaza . We have these kind of needs and we know how to respond . We simply need the corridor to be opened so that we can respond . Soundcloud UN News : You said that what entered today is just a drop in the ocean . Do you know exactly how long the supplies that arrived into Gaza today can cover the needs of people there ? Jeremy Hopkins : What went in today can not cover the needs at all . It a very tiny , tiny proportion of what is needed . We need to have instead of 20 trucks a day at least 100 , 200 trucks going in per day that of course depends on what is on the trucks , but approximately speaking with food , water , medicine and fuel . That is a necessary condition for us to be able to respond to the humanitarian lifesaving requirements and needs right now . UN News : Since there is no ceasefire right now , what are the challenges to delivering and moving supplies across Gaza ? Jeremy Hopkins : It is going to be challenging . We need to deliver , and we have a humanitarian imperative which is driving us . At the same time , we do call for a cessation of hostilities immediately . Of course , that is the only way that we can actually deliver safely . But at the same time , we also call on the parties to the conflict to avoid any targeting of health and education facilities , which allows us to deliver the aid safely to the health facilities and everywhere that they are needed . And we also remind the parties that health staff need to be protected in order to carry out their mandate .',\n",
              " 'Pro terrorist student mobs are going to turn violent The pro terrorist , pro Palestinian student mobs on college campuses are going to turn violent sooner rather than later as long as spineless university administrators continue to coddle their antisemitic students . The most jarring and ominous example of this comes from the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art . There , an antisemitic pro Palestine read : pro terrorism rally identified several Jewish students studying in the school library . Those pro terrorism protesters then entered the library and began barricading all exits . The Jewish students were reportedly locked in a room by security for their own protection which the university denies , and they had to be sneaked out through tunnels . WHY TRUMP FULTON COUNTY CO DEFENDANTS KEEP TAKING PLEA AGREEMENTS That is not all that is galling about this situation . University staff encouraged this protest , which , again , is a pro terrorism celebration of Hamas slaughter of Jewish civilians . Police were called but did nothing , and there is no indication that anyone has been arrested . Worst of all , the university could even bring itself to recognize the gravity of the situation , instead dismissing it by claiming that the Library was closed for approximately 20 minutes while student protesters moved through our building . Some students who were previously in the library remained during this time . All students have now dispersed . \" 2 . Faculty members CANCELLED CLASS for the walk out , ENCOURAGED students to participate and even offered EXTRA CREDIT to do so . Councilwoman Inna Vernikov October 26 , 2023 5 . The NYPD did not show up right away , and when they did show up , they never entered the building , at least to the students knowledge . NYPD told the students later on that DID NOT ALLOW THE NYPD onto school grounds . Cooper is a private institution Councilwoman Inna Vernikov October 26 , 2023 This is going to get worse , and it is going to get worse because the leadership of most universities is as spineless as Cooper Union . Just look at George Washington University , which could even condemn the unsanctioned projection of glory to our martyrs and free Palestine from the river to the sea on the wall of the university library . These pro massacre antisemitic student mobs are going to grow more emboldened . How long is it before one of these demonstrations turns violent ? CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER The president of Cooper Union , Laura Sparks , should be forced out or resign . Every member of that student mob should be expelled at the very least . And yes , any students celebrating the slaughter of Jews at the hands of antisemitic terrorists at these university protests who are here on visas should have their visas revoked . We are at the point now that Jews have to be smuggled out of buildings for their own protection and are being told by the New York City Police Department to avoid certain areas where pro terrorist protests are taking place . Jews should definitely avoid the area NYPD 2023 Mendy Pellin October 26 , 2023 This is unacceptable , and the cleanup starts on college campuses . These mobs of pro terrorist antisemites should be discouraged by university staff , expelled when circumstances call for it as is the case at Cooper Union , and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law whenever they commit a crime while , again , marching in favor of the slaughter of Jews . Any university administrator who drags their feet on this should be unemployed immediately because their nonchalance will only lead these mobs to escalate into something much worse .',\n",

The ICRC said this was a small dose of relief to help alleviate the extreme pressure on Gaza doctors and nurses , as the casualty toll from Israeli airstrikes mounts and the hospital system collapses . In Egypt , the army said an unidentified drone fell by a hospital in the coastal town of Taba , near the border with Israel , injuring six people .

              " 'In entering Gaza , the IDF will be facing not just Hamas , but Iran Axis of Resistance ARGUABLY NO COUNTRY BENEFITED more from the American invasion of Iraq than the Islamic Republic of Iran . In a war that lasted over a decade , Washington spent over 2 trillion of its own funds to eliminate one of Iran most powerful regional adversaries . In the process , the invasion facilitated the rise of Iraq militant Shia movement , which today forms the core of the Iraq Popular Mobilization Forces PMF . Although it is technically an auxiliary branch of the Iraqi security forces , the PMF regularly looks to Tehran for guidance . The PMF belongs to what Iranian leaders refer to as the Axis of Resistance mehvar e moqâvemat in Farsi , a term that denotes the extraordinary expansion of Iran influence in the Middle East and Central Asia in recent years . In addition to the PMF in Iraq , the Axis of Resistance incorporates an international coalition of dozens of armed groups , militant factions , Shia tribes , and political parties . They range from the Houthis in Yemen and the Hezbollah in Lebanon , to entire branches of the Syrian Armed Forces , and even Shia militias in Afghanistan , Azerbaijan , and Bahrain . The coalition also includes a complex mosaic of armed Palestinian groups , such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad and increasingly after 2018 Hamas . These actors are certainly disparate , and often contrast with each other . For instance , relations between Hamas and the Syrians have been strained for years . All of them , however , are united in their common anti Western stance and contempt for pro Western states in the Middle East , including Saudi Arabia and Israel . Moreover , their ties under the Axis of Resistance umbrella remain informal and relatively loose . However , they all receive support including funding and training from Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps IRGC , a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces that protects and promotes the ideological inheritance of the 1979 Islamic Revolution . Since 2011 , the IRGC has viewed the Axis of Resistance as a vital element of its asymmetric military strategy . Its purpose is to help Iran successfully confront its much stronger adversaries , two of which the United States and Israel are nuclear armed . That is precisely why Tehran has invested nothing short of a fortune to transform Hezbollah into what experts describe as a force multiplier that can give Israel a run for its money . In 2014 , Tehran launched a similar effort in the Gaza Strip , initially with Palestinian Islamic Jihad a group that , very much like Hamas , emerged out of the Egyptian Islamic Brotherhood in the . The financial arrangement between Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Iran alarmed Hamas , which has controlled Gaza since 2008 . Over time , however , Hamas too began to flirt with Iran Axis of Resistance , enticed by the lucrative funding and training opportunities offered by Tehran . By 2020 , Hamas was actively engaging with the IRGC under the Axis of Resistance umbrella . To a significant extent , the operational sophistication of the October 7 attack on Israel , which was jointly led by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad , provided clear evidence of Iran patronage of these two militant groups . Because of Iran , the Palestinian armed factions in Gaza are today better armed and better trained than at any time in the past . They will likely demonstrate that in the coming days or weeks , as the Israel Defense Forces IDF begin their ground offensive on Gaza . The big question , however , is how the other components of the Axis of Resistance will respond to the impending IDF attack . Experts are quick to point out that neither Iran nor Hezbollah are particularly excited at the prospect of joining a bloody and likely protracted war with Israel . The crumbling Lebanese state and the deeply divided Iranian society seem incapable of withstanding let alone surviving a major war . However , it seems unlikely that Hamas and its Gaza Strip allies would have launched such a devastating terrorist attack on Israel , with predictable far reaching consequences for the entire Middle East , without prior coordination with the IRGC and , by association , leading elements of the Axis of Resistance . In other words , Iran was aware of the Hamas attack and almost certainly promised Hamas that it would not face the ensuing IDF onslaught alone . As the IDF is preparing to enter Gaza , Hamas leaders are acutely aware that their only hope to successfully beat back the impending Israeli onslaught is the emergence of a second front in the war , along the Israeli Lebanese border . Only Hezbollah can make that happen , with Iran implicit approval . The United States was quick to send two aircraft carriers to the Mediterranean , effectively signaling to Hezbollah that it will not hesitate to enter the conflict should the Lebanese militant group open up a northern front in the war . US President Joe Biden unprecedented wartime trip to Israel was a clear attempt to send a similar message to Tehran . Will these messages suffice to convince the Iranians to keep their distance from the war , and thus throw Hamas under the proverbial bus ? Perhaps . However , abandoning Hamas to its fate would create divisions in the Axis of Resistance , which Tehran has been meticulously curating for over a decade . Iranian leaders can not afford to lose command of the Axis of Resistance , which they view as a crucial weapon in their confrontation with the United States and its allies . As one commentator noted recently , the war in Gaza represents the first significant test event of the cooperation between the elements of the Axis of Resistance under the leadership of the IRGC . Most observers agree that , at present , there is no evidence that Iran intends to broaden the conflict which is likely bad news for Hamas . However , wars are by nature unpredictable , and Tehran has already started issuing dire sounding threats , saying that it will not remain a spectator if the IDF enters Gaza . Should Iran threats materialize , it is unlikely that Russia and China will remain on the sidelines . The specter of a broader regional conflict lurks ominously in the background .

              " 'After 3 weeks of uncertainty , Republican Mike Johnson elected new US House speaker Johnson on Wednesday was elected by 220 to 209 votes in a bitterly divided Congress , three weeks after his predecessor Kevin McCarthy was unceremoniously voted out of the seat for the first time in US history . In the 435 member House , the Republicans hold a slender majority with 221 seats against 212 of the Democrats . The position of Speaker of the House of Representatives is one of the most powerful political chairs in the country and is third in the line of succession after the US President . Washington : Republican Congressman from Louisiana Mike Johnson has been elected as the Speaker of the House of Representatives , bringing an end to three weeks of uncertainty in US politics . The Speaker of the House of Representatives , Johnson , 51 , a lawyer by profession , is a four term Congressman from the Fourth Congressional District of Louisiana . In his maiden address to the Congress , Speaker Johnson said his first legislative agenda would be to bring a resolution in support of Israel , a country that was hit by a terrorist attack by Hamas early this month . We are going to show not only Israel but the entire world that the barbarism of Hamas that we have seen play out on our television screens is wretched and wrong , he said . We want our allies around the world to know that this body of lawmakers is reporting again to our duty stations . Let the enemies of freedom around the world hear us loud and clear : The people house is back in business , Johnson said . However , his main challenge at hand would be to avoid a government shutdown by passing the spending bill and approving the billion request by President Joe Biden to fund the war in Israel and Ukraine . Johnson , whose candidature was supported by former president Donald Trump , said that he would propose a short term measure to fund the government through January 15 or April 15 . So , at this time yesterday , nobody was thinking of Mike and then we put out the word and now he speaker of the House , so I wanted to thank all of the supporters that I have and I want to thank all of the supporters Mike has , and again he will be a great speaker , Trump said after the election of the new speaker . In his speech , Johnson indicated that he is getting down to business immediately . The American people business is too urgent at this moment , he said . We in the majority right now . We gone through a little bit of suffering . We gone through a little bit of character building . And , you know what it produced ? More strength , more perseverance , and a lot of hope . And that what we are about to deliver to the American people , Johnson said , adding that he would have an aggressive schedule in the days and weeks ahead . US President Joe Biden said he is looking forward to working with the Speaker Johnson . According to the White House , this afternoon , Biden called Johnson to congratulate him on his election , and expressed that he looks forward to working together to find common ground on behalf of the American people While House Republicans spent the last 22 days determining who would lead their conference , I have worked on those pressing issues , proposing a historic supplemental funding package that advances our bipartisan national security interests in Israel and Ukraine , secures our border , and invests in the American people . These priorities have been endorsed by leaders in both parties , Biden said in a statement . We need to move swiftly to address our national security needs and to avoid a shutdown in 22 days . Even though we have real disagreements about important issues , there should be mutual effort to find common ground wherever we can , he said .

              " 'Gaza crisis : Deadlock deepens as Security Council rejects competing resolutions by US and Russia The US led draft resolution failed to pass owing to a negative vote by permanent Security Council members China and Russia . Ten members of the Council voted for the draft resolution and three against China , Russia and UAE , with two abstentions Brazil and Mozambique . Tweet URL A no vote from any one of the five permanent members of the Council stops action on any measure put before it . The body permanent members are China , France , Russian Federation , the United Kingdom , and the United States . Russian backed resolution A second draft resolution , led by Russia , was not adopted as it failed to secure sufficient number of votes in favour . Four Council members voted in favour China , Gabon , Russia and UAE , two against UK and US , and nine abstained Albania , Brazil , Ecuador , France , Ghana , Japan , Malta , Mozambique , Switzerland . For a resolution to be adopted , it must be supported by at least nine members of the Council . The proposed texts The similarly worded resolutions would have called for a humanitarian ceasefire or humanitarian pause to enable safe delivery of aid for desperate civilians . Both drafts condemned the terror attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians of 7 October and urged action to address the worsening humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip , where fuel is due to run out for hospitals and other crucial services , in a matter of hours , according to UN agencies on the ground . Key differences in the text included a specific mention in the US backed proposal of States inherent right to self defence , and a call in the Russian led one for the immediate cancellation by Israeli forces of the evacuation order for civilians to head into southern Gaza . Draft resolutions do not represent the official position of the 15 member Security Council until adopted . Some Council members spoke to state their positions ahead of the votes . Tweet URL United States US Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield said the fruits of diplomacy have played out over the past few days , with humanitarian aid beginning to reach Gaza . The US will continue to work towards that effort , which is reflected in the draft resolution , she said . Welcoming the release of four hostages by Hamas , she thanked Qatar and Egypt for their mediation . However , more than 200 hostages remain . Parents lie awake at night wondering if they will ever see their children again , she said , recalling her meeting on Tuesday with a family of one of the hostages . This moment is a test for all of us , for the international community and the Council , she said . In drafting the resolution , we listened , we engaged , including with humanitarian agencies , and the draft contains language on deconfliction mechanisms to protect civilians and UN personnel . However , Russia put forward a text with zero consultations , she said . The bottom line is this : Russia has offered up yet another resolution in bad faith , she said , calling for support for the US draft , which condemns the heinous attacks by Hamas , confirms the right of Member States to self defence and calls on parties to respect international humanitarian law . It also calls for humanitarian pauses and indicates that Member States must take concrete steps to prevent the spread of the conflict . We must continue to work towards a future where two democratic states Israel and Palestine live side by side in peace , she said , urging all Council members to vote in favour of the US draft . Russia Vassily Nebenzya , Russia Ambassador to the UN , said it was extremely lamentable that for two weeks since the crisis erupted , the Security Council has not been able to send a collective signal to deescalate the situation . The bloodshed is ongoing , the number of civilian causalities in now in the thousands and millions are displaced , he said , urging a hard think about the shocking figures . He recalled the earlier Russian proposal , a depoliticized resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire , which unfortunately was not supported by most members of the Council . National and narrow self centred ideological and political interests prevailed over the aim of stopping a humanitarian disaster , he said , noting also the US veto of the Brazilian led resolution last week . He went on to note that he saw no point in supporting the US led draft that served the geopolitical interests of one of the Security Council members . Concluding his statement , Nebenzya said he urged Council members to support the Russia led text , stating : This is the last attempt by the Council to fulfill the noble functions entrusted to it . We urge you not to miss it . UN Photo Eskinder Debebe Security Council members vote on one of the draft resolutions concerning the crisis in Gaza . Voting aftermath US Ambassador Thomas Greenfield expressed deep disappointment in the vetoing of the US resolution by China and Russia . The US stands ready to work with all Member States to support the efforts of the UN Secretary General , President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken , she said . Expressing dismay after the Russian resolution fell , Ambassador Nebenzia regretted that once again , the Council had failed to respond to the unprecedented conflict in the Middle East . US Representative Robert Wood said his delegation could not support the Russian draft , which did not reflect reality on the ground . We must put the region and the world above all else , he said . China China Ambassador Zhang Jun said they had used their veto against the US resolution based on facts , based on law , based on conscience , based on justice . He said in discussions the US text had emerged seriously out of balance , introduced in haste and lacking the strongest calls necessary for a full ceasefire . He said China was fully in favour of taking action but accused the US text of being evasive on the key issue of ending the fighting . Ceasefire is not only a diplomatic term , he added , it is a matter of life and death for many civilians . We would be irresponsible if we are ambiguous on the issue of war and peace , said the Ambassador , stressing that China is not indifferent to the suffering of Gazans . He said because the US text failed to mention the root causes of the current crisis in Gaza , without reference to Israel blockade or the evacuation order for civilians to move south , his country would be voting in favour of the Russian text . He said the US effort if adopted , would completely end the possibility of a long term two State solution to the Israel Palestine conflict . UN Photo Manuel Elías Ambassador Barbara Woodward of the United Kingdom addresses the Security Council . United Kingdom UK Ambassador Barbara Woodward said through the US proposal , the Council could have condemned Hamas terrorist attacks . At the same time , Russia draft failed to recognize Israel right to self defence . We are committed to work across the Council towards a balanced text , she said , which should include a condemnation of Hamas , reaffirm Israel self defence rights , protect civilians , and get more aid flowing into Gaza . United Arab Emirates The United Arab Emirates Ambassador Lana Zaki Nusseibeh said the stakes are too high and the Council must step up . We know what the most pressing humanitarian needs are , she said , adding that these include a humanitarian ceasefire , release of all hostages , humanitarian access , fuel , water , and adherence to international humanitarian law . Israel Israel Ambassador Gilad Erdin said his country continues to be attacked , from north and south , and asked Council members how they would feel if faced with this reality . You would feel there is a blatant double standard , he said , and that the Council is taking even the most basic steps anyone with a slight moral compass should take . This is precisely how the State of Israel feels right now . Israel has a right to self defence , he said , adding that Hamas is solely responsible for Palestinian situation in Gaza and is committing crimes against humanity . In the wake of the Holocaust , we collectively swore never again , he said . This is one of the main reasons the UN was established . Never again , dear colleagues , is now . Do not forget this . UN Photo Eskinder Debebe The Security Council open debate on the crisis on Tuesday Previous action Last Monday , a previous Russian led draft resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire was voted down and the following Wednesday , the United States vetoed a Brazilian led text that urged humanitarian pauses to deliver aid to millions in the Gaza Strip .

              " 'Iranian Foreign Minister surprise visit to New York The Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs embarked on an unexpected trip to New York , signalling a potentially significant development on the international stage . State run media in the Islamic Republic of Iran have reported that Hossein Amir Abdollahian , the country Foreign Minister , has made an unexpected trip to New York to continue regional and international negotiations . On Wednesday , the IRNA news agency reported that Iran Foreign Minister arrived in New York to engage in international negotiations in the wake of escalating tensions between Palestine and Israel and the potential exacerbation of this regional crisis . It is worth noting that the Iranian Foreign Minister trip to New York comes in response to the increased regional tensions following the attacks on bases in Iraq and Syria . Joni Ernst , a Republican Senator , criticized Abdollahian visit to New York , emphasizing that while terrorists backed by the Islamic Republic have attacked forces and taken American citizens hostage , the Biden administration is granting a visa to a senior official of the Islamic Republic . These appeasements must come to an end . Previously , President Joe Biden had also warned in response to attacks on forces in Iraq and Syria that if Iran or its proxy groups continue to target American positions in the Middle East , the leaders of the Islamic Republic will face a resolute response from Washington . Furthermore , Iran Minister of Foreign Affairs , in a letter to Volker Türk , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , described Israel attacks on Gaza as a flagrant violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people and crimes against humanity . These developments come amidst escalating tensions in the Middle East , initiated by Hamas attack on Israel , and despite various reactions , these conflicts have entered their third week .',\n",

AP Photo Christophe Ena , Pool TEL AVIV : French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Tel Aviv on Tuesday to express his country \" full solidarity \" with Israel after the deadly October 7 attacks by Palestinian militant group Hamas , according to an AFP journalist . His visit comes more than two weeks after Hamas militants stormed into Israel from the Gaza Strip and killed at least people , mostly civilians who were shot , mutilated or burned to death on the first day of the raid , according to Israeli officials . Among them were 30 French citizens . Macron was due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express France \" full solidarity \" with Israel after that attack , the French presidency said . He was also expected to call for the \" preservation of the civilian population \" in Gaza , amid Israel relentless bombardment , and as it prepares for a ground invasion of the overcrowded Palestinian enclave . More than people , most of them women and children , have died during Israel attacks , according to numbers given by the Hamas run health ministry . Macron will in particular call for a \" humanitarian truce \" to allow desperately needed aid into Gaza , whose million people have been largely deprived of water , food , electricity and other basic supplies after an Israeli blockade , the Elysee Palace said . Macron and Netanyahu were due to hold a joint press conference at pm 1000 GMT . The French head of state was also due to meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog , as well as opposition leaders Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid in Jerusalem . And in Tel Aviv , he was due to meet the families of French and French Israeli nationals killed in the Hamas attack or being held hostage in Gaza . Seven French citizens are still missing : one of them , a French woman , has been confirmed as among the more than 200 people Israel says were taken hostage by Hamas . Macron has said the others are also thought to be hostages , but there has not yet been confirmation . The French president also aims to continue efforts \" to avoid a dangerous escalation in the region \" , the Elysee said , amid growing alarm over swelling cross border exchanges between Israel and Iran backed Hezbollah in Lebanon . Macron will propose relaunching a \" true peace process \" , with the aim of creating a viable Palestinian state in exchange for guarantees from regional powers towards \" Israel security \" . There will also probably be exchanges with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas , King Abdullah II of Jordan , Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi , and leaders of Gulf nations , the Elysee said . US President Joe Biden , German Chancellor Olaf Scholz , British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni have already visited Israel .',\n",

              " 'DC Edit Did UN chief cross a line ? The UN General Assembly nonbinding decisions can do little when man takes on man and transforms into an animal like avatar bent upon death . AP File Photo The United Nations is a toothless tiger in whose history the world is still searching for any war that it had helped stop . Apart from pedantic calls for an immediate ceasefire , there is little the association of nations can do if the combatants do not wish to heed well meaning advice . The UN does , however , reflect the divisions already etched in this conflicted world . Even so , Secretary General Antonio Guterres may have crossed a line in recalling the genesis of the coordinated terror attack on multiple places that Hamas carried out with an unparalleled show of barbarity . Of course , there is a history to it , as much as there will be to any militant movement . And yet there can be no justification whatsoever for acts of terror , even if the epic suffering of today is a result of historical occupation of places the Palestinians lived in . The way the UN secretary general said it about Palestine , it did sound as if he was justifying Hamas barbarous acts . The UN Secretary General did condemn the 7 attack on Israel that has brought the region to its current state teetering on the brink of a wider conflict , with Israel facing the prospect of a two front war as Hezbollah commando force in southern Lebanon is straining at the leash while the leadership in Beirut advises restraint . But in doing so while castigating the other side for inflicting a collective punishment on the Palestinians , he has proved to be less diplomatic and far too political while calling for a humanitarian ceasefire . Nothing takes place in a vacuum , not even a UN meeting or the right to veto that renders it powerless to exert any of its collective decisions . With the Security Council hamstrung , the UN General Assembly nonbinding decisions can do little when man takes on man and transforms into an animal like avatar bent upon death and destruction . The UN is not going to help end this war . Even the US , while calling for restraint as a trickle of hostages are being released by Hamas terrorists , has said that Israel will decide for itself when to go ahead with the ground offensive to get at the Hamas leadership . Will reason return in time is the only question that needs to be answered now but UN politics will not be aiding it .',\n",

As of now , sections of the mosque plaza are open to Jewish worshippers .

              " 'Sudan Peace Negotiations to Resume in Jeddah Thursday UN General Assembly to Vote on New Gaza Immediate Ceasefire Draft at Security Council President of the UN General Assembly , Dennis Francis , delivers a speech in the General Hall AP The UN General Assembly is expected to vote Friday on a draft resolution submitted by the Arab group to demand an \" immediate and unconditional ceasefire \" in Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid to more than two million civilians in the enclave , predicted diplomats . The ten non permanent members of the Security Council began preparing a draft resolution concerning the war after the most powerful UN body charged with maintaining international peace and security failed to take an effective position . Despite 20 days of war and thousands of deaths and injuries , diplomats sought to use all available means to intervene . Jordan has tabled a draft resolution to be voted on at the Emergency Special Session ESS on behalf of the Arab Group . The draft text calls for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access . Palestinian delegate Riyad Mansour announced on Wednesday that the General Assembly is expected to vote on the draft resolution on Friday afternoon , hoping it would allow the General Assembly to work while the Security Council remains paralyzed . The Security Council failed again Wednesday to address the Israeli Hamas war in Gaza , rejecting the US and Russian resolutions . The council is the UN most powerful body , charged with maintaining international peace and security , but its divisions have left it impotent and scrambling to find a resolution with acceptable language . The resolution prepared by the US , Israel closest ally , would stress Israel right to self defense , urge respect for international laws , and call for humanitarian pauses to deliver aid to Gaza . On Wednesday evening , Russia and China used their veto power against the US project , knowing it received support from ten countries . The UAE rejected the resolution , while Brazil and Mozambique abstained . The Russian draft resolution , which was also put to a vote , called for an \" immediate humanitarian ceasefire \" and unequivocally condemns the attacks of 7 and the \" indiscriminate attacks \" on civilians and civilian targets in Gaza . In that vote , four countries voted in favor Russia , China , the UAE , and Gabon . The United States and the UK voted against it , and nine countries abstained . The resolution was adopted because it failed to get the minimum nine \" yes \" votes . The failure of the two resolutions followed the council rejections last week of a Russian resolution that did mention Hamas and also failed to get nine \" yes \" votes and a widely supported Brazilian resolution vetoed by the US that would have condemned the Hamas attacks and all violence against civilians and called for \" humanitarian pauses . \" Russia UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia justified the veto by saying that the US draft resolution could be interpreted as the Security Council support for Israel plans to start a ground operation in Gaza . Nebenzia warned that Israel prospective forceful operation in Gaza carried out in the current manner and with gross violations of human laws and massive loss of civilian life , risks provoking a larger conflict that could encompass the entire region and even go beyond its borders . Whereas the Chinese delegate Zhang Jun said the US draft resolution was \" out of balance \" and \" deeply divisive \" on the urgent issue of ending the fighting . He called it \" evasive on the most urgent issue of ending the fighting , \" saying it does not reflect the world strongest calls for a ceasefire or an end to the fighting and does not help resolve the issue . \" At this moment , ceasefire is not just a diplomatic term . It means the life and death of many civilians . \" After the double veto , the US ambassador , Linda Thomas Greenfield , told the 15 member council that Washington was deeply disappointed that Russia and China vetoed this resolution . \" Though today vote was a setback , we must not be deterred . \" Also , US representative Robert Wood said that the \" bad faith resolution \" put forward by Russia lacked consensus and failed to reflect realities on the ground . \" It was regrettable that Moscow chose to further divide the Council rather than address the needs of Israel and Palestine , \" he added . British delegate Barbara Woodward said the US draft would have had a tangible impact on the ground by calling for humanitarian pauses and the hostages release . She added that the British delegation voted against Russia text as it failed to recognize Israel right to self defense . The deep divisions in the Security Council caused frustration among several diplomats . A diplomat said France tried vainly to persuade Russia and the US to withdraw their texts before referring them to a vote . Meanwhile , the UAE Ambassador , Lana Nusseibeh , said the UN and humanitarian organizations have made clear that what is essential is a humanitarian ceasefire , the release of all hostages , and sustained humanitarian access to Gaza . Nusseibeh said there were \" dozens of statements imploring this council to assign the same value to Palestinian life as it does to Israeli life , \" adding : \" We can not allow any equivocation on this point . \" In response , Israel UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan thanked the US and other nations that supported its resolution for condemning \" savage genocidal terrorists while standing up for the values of freedom and security . \" He denounced those who voted against the resolution , saying they showed the world the Security Council is incapable of condemning \" terrorists and can not confirm the right to self defense of the victim of these heinous crimes . \" After the failure of the US and Russian drafts , Malta UN Ambassador Vanessa Frazier , speaking on behalf of the ten elected council members serving two year terms , announced they would be working on a new proposal in the coming days . \" As elected members of this council , we also represent the rest of the international community , and we have a duty and an obligation to act , \" Frazier told the council . \" There is no time to waste . \"',\n",

The new statement calls out by name the United Against Nuclear Iran UANI , a group chaired by former Joe Lieberman . Two days after Hamas attack , Lieberman and UANI CEO Mark Wallace urged the , Israel , and their allies \" to launch strikes against military and intelligence targets in Iran . \" The Iranian activists warned that such an attack would \" bring a massive avalanche of suffering and destruction upon our country . \" While denouncing the Iranian government \" tyranny and oppression \" at home and \" tension causing policies \" abroad , the activists said they oppose \" the direct and indirect call for a military attack on Iran , under any guise and with any pretext . \" \" We ask all Iranians not to allow opportunists to tie the struggle of the Iranian people for democracy , freedom , and peace with warmongering and calling for a military attack on our country , \" they wrote . The statement was released amid mounting fears that Israel assault on the Gaza Strip could soon become a wider regional conflict , particularly once Israel launches its expected ground invasion of the besieged Palestinian enclave . In recent days , the Biden administration has mobilized missile defense systems and aircraft carriers to the Middle East , placed thousands of troops on higher alert , and sent additional arms to Israel in what been described as an effort to deter Iran and Lebanon Hezbollah from getting involved in the war on Gaza . Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire intermittently since October 7 . officials have blamed Iran for recent drone attacks on American troops stationed in Syria and Iraq , even while acknowledging it not clear that Iran ordered the attacks . In a speech to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday , Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared that \" the United States does not seek conflict with Iran \" and does not \" want this war to widen . \" \" But if Iran or its proxies attack personnel anywhere , make no mistake : we will defend our people , we will defend our and decisively , \" said Blinken . Iranian leaders , for their part , have said they could be forced to act if Israel invades Gaza .

              " 'What international laws can be used against Israel for war crimes against Palestinians ? Children after an explosion at a Gaza hospital receive treatment on October 17 , 2023 . AFP Since Hamas launched its attack on October 7 , there has been a protracted conflict between the Israeli and the Palestinian group that has resulted in numerous deaths and claims of war crimes on both sides . The conflict is governed by a convoluted international legal framework that was established following World War II . The laws of armed conflict apply to all parties involved in a war , regardless of whether states claim they are defending themselves . What laws govern the conflict ? The 1949 Geneva Conventions , which have been adopted by all UN member nations , established internationally recognised guidelines for armed combat . These guidelines are further strengthened by decisions made by international war crimes tribunals . The \" Law of Armed Conflict \" or \" International Humanitarian Law \" is the collective term for a set of treaties that regulate how citizens , soldiers , and POWs are treated . It covers both organised armed groups , such as Hamas and government forces . What acts could violate war crimes law ? Human Rights Watch , based in New York , listed the intentional destruction of civilians , the indiscriminate firing of rockets , the kidnapping of civilians by Palestinian armed organisations , and the Israeli counterattacks in Gaza that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians as potential war crimes . The Geneva Conventions expressly forbid the abduction of hostages , murder , and torture . Israel response may also be the focus of a war crimes investigation . Following the attack by Hamas , Israel besieged Gaza , a city of million people , and began the most massive bombing campaign in the 75 year history of the Israeli Palestinian conflict , demolishing entire neighbourhoods . On Tuesday , UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed alarm about \" clear violations of international humanitarian law \" in Gaza and begged for the protection of people . What do the Geneva Conventions say ? Protecting civilians during armed conflict and reducing suffering during hostilities is the main objective of the Geneva Conventions and , by extension , international humanitarian law . Members of state armed forces , volunteer and military forces , and non state armed groups are all considered combatants under the laws pertaining to armed conflict . If a siege is deemed to be disproportionate or targets people instead of being a legal way to weaken Hamas military capabilities , it may be classified as a war crime . Under the laws of armed conflict , it is legally unlawful to target civilians or civilian objects directly . Nonetheless , there are situations in which ordinarily innocuous objects can turn into acceptable targets for the military . Even in that case , strikes against military targets must be proportionate that is , they can not cause an undue number of civilian casualties or damage to civilian property . The concept of proportionality does not include comparing the number of civilian casualties on opposing sides ; rather , it implies that the number of civilian deaths should be commensurate with the actual and tangible military advantage that is anticipated from that particular strike . Which institutions can try alleged war crimes ? Local courts , in this case , those in Israel and the Palestinian territories , will hear cases pertaining to alleged war crimes first . The International Criminal Court ICC in the Hague is the only international court authorised to file charges if suspects are not prosecuted domestically . The Rome Statute , which established the International Criminal Court , grants it the legal power to look into claims of crimes committed by citizens of its member states or on their territory when local authorities are \" unwilling or unable \" to do so . What is the role of the ICC ? The permanent war crimes tribunal for the world , the International Criminal Court ICC , was established in the Hague in 2002 . It has jurisdiction over crimes against humanity , war crimes , and genocide committed by citizens of its 123 member nations or in those states . Many of the world superpowers , such as Egypt , China , Russia , India , and the United States , are not members . While Israel does not openly interact with the International Criminal Court ICC and rejects its authority , the ICC accepts Palestine as a member state . ICC prosecutors are currently looking into 17 cases , spanning from Sudan and Myanmar to Ukraine and Afghanistan , despite having small personnel and funding . Since 2021 , the International Criminal Court ICC has been looking into claims of war crimes and crimes against humanity that may have been perpetrated in the occupied Palestinian territories . It has released any warrants for arrest .',\n",

Israel Defense Minister , Yoav Gallant , informed soldiers near Gaza that the order to enter the Palestinian enclave would be given soon . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also expressed confidence in a major victory . Evacuation in Northern Israel The Defense Ministry and the Israel Defense Forces announced the evacuation of residents from the northern city of Kiryat Shmona to state subsidized guest houses due to repeated rocket and missile attacks by the Hezbollah terror group and other Palestinian factions .

The protesters joined college students on campuses across the United States , calling for a ceasefire in a war that has left thousands dead in less than three weeks . About Israelis were killed in a surprise attack by Hamas on 7 , while Israel retaliatory airstrikes have since left dead in Gaza , according unverified data from the Gaza Ministry of Health , an agency of the Hamas controlled government . At the rally and teach in on Sproul Plaza , the protesters demanded that UC Berkeley divest from arms manufacturers that create weapons used by Israel and make a public statement supporting Palestine . We denounce the one sided and dehumanizing narratives parroted by politicians , corporations and institutions , including UC Berkeley and especially Berkeley Law School , regarding the genocide of the people of Gaza , Abo Emad , a UC Berkeley student , said at the rally . Since Hamas seized power in 2007 , Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip , home to more than 2 million Palestinians , controlling trade and restricting residents movement in and out of Gaza . Student organizers led the crowd in chants decrying Israeli brutality and backing Palestine right to what students described as justified resistance while a handful of young people waved the Israeli flag nearby .

Credit : Ximena Natera , Berkeleyside CatchLight The protest is the latest in a swell of pro Palestinian activity on college campuses since the war began . On the day of the attack by Hamas , Bears for Palestine , a pro Palestinian campus group , released a statement offering its unwavering support of the resistance in Gaza , describing it as the product of decades of violence by Israel . A statement signed by at least 250 UC Berkeley faculty condemned the portrayal by some on campus of the 7 Hamas attacks as a freedom fight to be celebrated . This is repugnant and indefensible , the statement said . was shocking to realize that literally while Hamas terrorists were going house to house seeking to murder as many Jews as they could , some pro Palestinian organizations on our own campus were gathering petition signatures for statements that celebrated these Hamas terrorists as freedom fighters and rejected any critiques of their actions , the statement said . Disturbed by what he saw as a broader attitude against Jews on campus , UC Berkeley Law professor Steven Davidoff Solomon urged law firms not to hire students who sided with anti Zionist student groups in an op ed published by the Wall Street Journal . Berkeley Hillel organized their own teach in today , exploring Jewish sources for peace , justice and truth , according to a statement posted on Instagram .

JACKIE NORTHAM , BYLINE : Thanks , Ari . SHAPIRO : Jackie , let start with you . This is a fraught trip by Biden as the entire region tensely watches and Israel prepares for a possible ground invasion of Gaza . What did Biden say today ? NORTHAM : You know , Ari , Biden visit was really meant to send a message that the continues to fully support Israel . And , you know , the visit comes at a time when emotions are still raw here in Israel after the multipronged attack by Hamas militants on October 7 . And , you know , in a speech after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Biden compared it to the attacks in the He said he understood the shock and the all consuming rage that Israelis must feel and how they want justice . Here he is . SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : But I caution this while you feel that rage , do be consumed by it . After , we were enraged in the United States . While we sought justice and got justice , we also made mistakes . NORTHAM : And , Ari , of course , after , the invaded Iraq , and now Israel is preparing for a possible invasion of the Gaza Strip . You know , also , Biden reminded Israelis that the vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas and that the militant group does not represent the Palestinian people . SHAPIRO : Did Biden have anything to offer Palestinians ? NORTHAM : He announced 100 million in aid to help civilians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , but that probably wo do much right away given the situation , the deteriorating situation in Gaza . He also said he secured a commitment from Israel to allow humanitarian aid deliveries from Egypt into Gaza as soon as possible , you know , food , water , medicine . Israel has up until now not allowed aid in , fearing that Hamas militants could smuggle weapons into Gaza on the aid convoys . But Biden warned that if Hamas diverts or steals the assistance , the aid stops . But , you know , to be honest , these shipments could be held up by Egypt or Israel anyway . SHAPIRO : All right . Well , Ruth , Biden trip , as you know , was disrupted by events here . After days of Israeli bombings in Gaza , there was an explosion at a hospital where people had sought shelter . Hundreds were killed . We still do know the exact number . And there are different claims about what happened . So are the facts any clearer today ? What can you tell us ? SHERLOCK : Well , Ari , what we are seeing is , you know , terrible footage of people wounded , being rushed away , including children just covered in blood , crying . And like you say , the Baptist al Ahli Hospital , it was being used by families as a place to shelter . They had fled the bombardment in other areas thinking that this place was safe . I reached Fadel Naim . He the head of the orthopedic unit there , and he was in the operating theater when the explosion happened . He ran outside and found people wounded and dying . FADEL NAIM : Some of them died in our hands SHERLOCK : So he saying , you know , some of them died in our hands , others had huge injuries like limbs amputated . They were bleeding out , and we were trying to do everything we could to stop that . He said he used his own you know , doctors used their clothes to try to stem the bleeding . Now , both Israel and Palestinian leaders have tried to trade blame over who is responsible . Israel says this was the result of a failed rocket launched by Palestinian Islamic Jihad , the militant group . And it put out some video footage and other material it says is evidence . And now President Biden says data provided by the Pentagon backs Israel claims . But I should be really clear here , you know , NPR can not independently verify any of this . And it still early days to know what really happened . SHAPIRO : But even beyond the hospital , there is so much desperation and pain in Gaza . What is life like for people living there right now ? SHERLOCK : I mean , Ari , resources are running out , medicine is running out , fuel is running out . And I spoke with Aed Yaghi . He a doctor in Gaza . And he told me even drinking water is becoming scarce . AED YAGHI : The people , they are seeking hours to find water , any water . There is no water , no electricity . The food is short , there shortage of food in the markets . SHERLOCK : Like Jackie said , you know , there have been lines of aid trucks waiting at the Egyptian border to go into Gaza . But Israel , which controls Gaza borders , has been blocking that aid from coming in . Today , Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu office said that they will allow in some aid to go through Egypt to southern Gaza . But the Israeli Defense Ministry told NPR it does appear that that will include fuel , which is essential for supporting water desalination plants and hospitals .

There were the anti Israeli street protests really erupted immediately after the explosion at the Gaza hospital , so we seeing , you know , places like Egypt , Bahrain and Lebanon . Even the State Department ordered the voluntary departure of family members from Lebanon . You know , the concern , Ari , is that all this could intensify if Israel does launch a ground war , ground invasion , as it has indicated . It could all just sort of spiral out of control , and that the real fear . SHAPIRO : That is NPR Jackie Northam in Jerusalem and Ruth Sherlock here in Tel Aviv . Thank you both for your reporting .

These precision self defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against USpersonnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups that began on October 17 . As a result of these attacks , one US citizen contractor died from a cardiac incident while sheltering in place ; 21 personnel suffered from minor injuries , but all have since returned to duty , \" Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III said . The US strikes reflect the Biden administration determination to maintain a delicate balance .

This uncompromising stance by Israel has put the lives of to people in northern Gaza at risk . The situation is dire , and the consequences are grave . The issue is not just political ; it is deeply human . \" Our staff will have to assume certain security risks if we determine the assistance that we have to be lifesaving and needs to be delivered , \" she added . These are brave individuals , ready to brave danger to save lives . Hastings went on to emphasize the heart wrenching reality on the ground : \" I have said it before that over a million people can not just pick up and move to the south where there have been repeated bombings , there is no service delivery , there is no shelter there . \" This dire situation underscores the urgency of delivering aid to the suffering population in the north . The humanitarian coordinator pleaded with Israel , saying : \" We need to be able to deliver assistance to those people , and we need to be able to deliver assistance to wherever people are in need . \" The message is clear the need is urgent , and human lives hang in the balance . Tragic statistics paint a grim picture . Since 7 , only 74 trucks have entered Gaza , with an additional eight expected today . This is a far cry from the 450 trucks that used to cross daily before that date . The contrast is staggering , highlighting the pressing need for more aid to reach the region . Before the conflict erupted , 46 trucks of fuel crossed into Gaza every day . Now , none have crossed since 7 . This fuel shortage is adding to the already overwhelming crisis in Gaza , impacting electricity , transportation , and essential services . The conflict in Gaza , which began with Hamas Operation Al Aqsa Flood on 7 , has resulted in almost lives lost . Tragically , this includes at least Palestinians and Israelis . The conflict shows no sign of abating , and the consequences are felt acutely by those who are most vulnerable . The commissioner general of the Agency for Palestinian Refugees UNRWA , Philippe Lazzarini , has also sounded the alarm about the dire situation in Gaza . He warned the region is on the brink of a massive health hazard because of the ongoing siege . Water , food , and medicine are running out , posing an imminent threat to the health and well being of the population . Lazzarini , speaking in Jerusalem , stated that a few aid trucks allowed into Gaza are far from sufficient . A cease fire is urgently needed as the health sector teeters on the verge of total collapse . UNRWA has lost at least 57 staff members since 7 , a stark reminder of the high human cost of this crisis . Lazzarini assured UNRWA follows stringent protocols to ensure aid does fall into the wrong hands , underscoring the importance of maintaining humanitarian assistance in the region .',\n",

As the name suggests , these are legit tunnels underground , dug to avoid blockades by Egyptians and Israelis on the movement of people and goods into and out of Gaza . According to a Jerusalem Post report , there are around 1300 tunnels connecting Gaza to Egypt and Israel . According to a News Walla report , the Egyptian government started constructing underground tunnels and stopping the illegal movement of people and goods into the Sainai . According to the Jerusalem Post , the tunnels are just 2 meters wide and 2 meters high . The US based Modern War Institute says most of the tunnels under the Gazan enclave are \" reinforced with concrete .

The enclave of Gaza Strip , with a bit more than million Palestinian population is surrounded by Egypt on one , Israel on two and the Mediterranean on the west side . So , the only in and out remains the border posts that are controlled by the Israeli Government . Since Hamas took over Gaza in 2007 , there have been multiple blockades on Gaza , following frequent tensions between Hamas and the Israelis . The state of Israel in return to strangle Gaza has used it to choke the enclave by restricting the flow of essentials into it . Maybe would like to explain this ? This was one of the most secret maps in the world . The map of the Gaza Strip metro system of Hamas terror tunnels . Each neighborhood had its own system and they are all connected . BOOM ! T Eye On Antisemitism May 20 , 2021 What are they used for ? But since it was constructed , it has not just been used for essentials . The tunnels over time , were used by the Hamas terrorists for operations , dwelling and movement . It is also noteworthy that the tunnels under Gaza are different from those used to connect Gaza to Israel . You find ammunition , rockets , living quarters of the Hamas leadership and command and control centres , Daphne Richemond Barak told MSNBC . These are not just random tunnels , these structures , underground also connect to \" schools and mosques \" , she added . Hence , the military installations we do have on the ground , say in India , are established underground in Gaza , like barracks , administrative facilities , ammunition depots , hospitals , etc .

              " 'What is Hamas armed wing , the Qassam Brigades ? Gaza based Qassam Brigades has been waging an armed resistance against Israeli occupation since its founding in 1992 . Hamas has been in the spotlight since October 7 , when its military wing , the Qassam Brigades , launched an attack on Israeli territory , killing about people and taking more than 200 people captives . Israel has pledged to finish all wings of the Palestinian resistance group , which has been governing the Gaza Strip since 2007 , in the wake of the attack . It has killed more than Palestinians in indiscriminate bombings that the United Nations chief said were clear violations of international humanitarian laws . Israel has launched six major assaults on Gaza since its troops withdrew from there in 2005 . In 2012 , it killed Ahmad Jabari , the chief of the Qassam Brigades , in air raids . Here what to know about the origins and evolution of the Brigades : What is Hamas and when was it founded ? Hamas was founded by Sheikh Ahmed Yasin and his aide Abdul Aziz al Rantisi as an offshoot of Egypt Muslim Brotherhood in 1987 . The association lasted until 2017 when Hamas indicated ending its ties with the Muslim Brotherhood . Hamas an acronym for Harakat al Muqawama al Islamiya Islamic Resistance Movement means zeal . It emerged during the first Intifada against Israeli occupation during which thousands of Palestinians came out to protest peacefully against Israeli land expropriation and illegal settlements . After a harsh response to their protest , Palestinians started to use rocks , and some groups resorted to small arms . Hamas favoured armed resistance to liberate Palestine and opposed the 1993 Oslo Accords , saying Israel used the deal to expand illegal settlements on territories occupied in 1967 . In 2006 , the group decided to participate in elections in Gaza . It won , but the transfer of power was not peaceful , as Fatah the party that dominates the Palestinian Authority PA tried to oust them from the Gaza Strip . Israel imposed a land , sea and air blockade on the enclave after Hamas took power , and it still decides what and who goes in and comes out of the Strip making it effectively an open air prison . Ismail Haniyeh , who had close ties with Hamas founder Yasin , leads the political wing of Hamas today . According to a survey by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in March , most Palestinians would vote for Haniyeh over current PA President Mahmoud Abbas or his Fatah party . Hamas continued social welfare activities , including food distribution during Ramadan and building schools , have solidified its support . What is the Qassam Brigades ? Hamas established its military unit in 1992 to centralise and structure the military actions its fighters had been taking against Israel in the and . The name is inspired by a Syrian fighter , Ezzedine al Qassam , who struggled against British occupation after he was expelled to Palestine , according to the group official website . Mohammed Deif is the military commander , assisted by his deputy , Marwan Issa . The Qassam Brigades actions against Israel have helped Hamas gain popularity among large segments of Palestinians , according to experts . The PA has become unpopular as it has failed to stop illegal settlements and continues security coordination with Israel . It became further marginalised by the rise of extreme far right Israeli politics . How strong are the Qassam Brigades ? According to the CIA World Factbook , the Qassam Brigades have to members , although this number is disputed . The Brigades have lost thousands of fighters in Israeli attacks and its resources have been depleted in Israeli air raids . Israel 2005 withdrawal from Gaza provided Hamas with the opportunity to rebuild its military wing . Financial support , allegedly from Iran , is said to have enabled the armed group to develop sophisticated military capabilities . Hamas sees its arsenal as a crucial deterrent . What is the Qassam Brigades military activities ? The Brigades are said to acquire their weapons through smuggling , allegedly getting some military support from Iran , and making some weapons locally , according to the CIA Factbook . Al Jazeera , however , could not independently verify the claims . They tend to rely on rocket attacks and have added drones to their arsenal recently . According to a 2021 report by the US Department of State , the Qassam and other Palestinian armed groups launched more than rockets in confrontations with Israel in 2021 . In 11 days of fighting , at least 260 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes while Israeli fatalities stood at 13 . Reports say the Qassam has expertise in improvised explosive devices IEDs and rocket launchers , antitank missiles and mortars , but they rely a great deal on strategy and stealth , with an extensive tunnel infrastructure that enables them to move around undetected . Why did Hamas attack on October 7 ? Hamas said its attack was in response to Israeli violations of the Al Aqsa Mosque compound and rising settler violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem . It also said that it had managed to take enough captives to bargain for the release of Palestinian prisoners languishing in Israeli jails , and some analysts have said the acceleration of Arab Israeli normalisation may have been another factor . This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on Earth , said Deif , the Qassam Brigades military commander . He openly called on supporters and Muslim nations to join the armed struggle . What are Gaza other armed resistance groups ? Other armed groups in Gaza have indicated that they are joining the current resistance against Israeli forces . Chief among them are the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Saraya al Quds Brigades . Formed in 1992 , al Quds has claimed responsibility for at least 23 rocket attacks , according to data gathered by the Critical Threats Project . The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine also has an active military presence in Gaza through the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades and has been joining calls for armed resistance through official Telegram messages .',\n",
              " 'Iranian Politician Says Israel Will Lose If Hamas Not Eliminated A prominent reformist figure in Iran says supporting Russia in Ukraine was a strategic mistake and support for Hamas could lead to yet another strategic blunder . Mohsen Mirdamadi , the vice speaker of the Iranian parliament under the reformist government of Mohammad Khatami in the late and early , suggested in an interview with Etemad newspaper in Tehranthat that the government should avoid any intervention in Israel war in Gaza . Mirdamadi reiterated that Iran involvement in the war is not likely to end well for Tehran . While criticizing the government for its over reliance on Russia instead of seeking to lift US sanctions and engage in negotiations to revive the JCPOA nuclear deal with world powers , Mirdamadi was the first influential reformist to announce a critical stance regarding the Gaza war . Speaking about the development with Iran International television on Wednesday , commentator Mohammad Rahbar said that in Mirdamadi statement , the \" government \" is in fact an alias to refer to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei . Incidentally , the interview was published , and the press review was aired on the same day that Khamenei once again praised the militant group Hamas for its terror attack on Israel and said that Palestinians will ultimately win the war . Mirdamadi also argued that as the war in Gaza continues , any development other than elimination of Hamas will be tantamount to a defeat for Israel . Agreeing with the essence of what the regime says about Hamas having inflicted a heavy blow on October 7 , he portrayed Israel as significantly weakened . He said that unlike the first days of the war , the world public opinion and media have now turned in favor of the Palestinians and Israel has been the loser and if the current trend continues it is going to be the final loser of the war . Mirdamadi reiterated , \" While Israel has repeatedly declared that its final objective is the total elimination of Hamas , any result other than that will be a defeat for Israel . \" He added : \" If Israel is not the winner of the war , one of the consequences of this for Israel will be the decline of its status . \" In the unlikely event that Israel defeats Hamas , he argued , Israel enemies in the region will be weakened . In this case , Israel will go the extra mile eliminating Hamas and Palestinians and will begin to eliminate other regional forces such as the Lebanese Hezbollah , \" Mirdamadi said , adding that \" However , doing so will spread the war and will entangle the region in a continuous conflict . \" Mirdamadi , one of the most influential reformist figures after former President Mohammad Khatami , who was once the leader of Iran most powerful reformist party Mosharekat Particiation , made sure to say in the interview that Khamenei also believes not to directly get involved in the Iarael Hamas war . He said Khamenei is aware of the dangers of getting involved in a direct confrontation with Israel and the United States and advised other Iranian politicians to avoid any statement that might heighten the risk for Iran intervention in the war . However , he pointed out that some Iranian officials took inappropriate positions contrary to what Khamenei thinks . He insisted that so far , Israel has been humiliated and no matter what the end result of the war might be , the idea of establishing an independent Palestinian state will be strongly supported once the conflict ends . Mirdamadi opined that Western countries will inevitably support the idea of an independent Palestinian state in order to prevent further crises . Iranian commentator Morteza Kazemian told Iran International news on Wednesday that Khamenei new position on the war in Gaza is likely to have been inspired by his isolation and by part of UN Chief Antonio Guterres and the United Arab Emirates UN envoy speech at the UN in which they criticized Western governments for their one sided support of Israel , although he also continued his usual bragging against Europe , the United States and Israel . Kazemian also accused Khamenei of having no concern about the lives of children and other civilians in Gaza .',\n",

              " 'India joined the information warfare on Gaza . Now it must prepare for tougher times The bombing of Gaza is now in its third week . Israel continues to kill and wound several thousand innocent civilians and destroy infrastructure , including mosques , hospitals , residential buildings , schools , UN premises , refugee camps , and any asset that it suspects of harbouring armed groups . Simultaneously , Gaza has been deprived of energy , food , water , and healthcare , for which it depended on Israel . Israel has also mobilised its armed forces , including land , maritime , and air power , which are poised to invade Gaza . It has called for the evacuation of the northern part of Gaza . Hamas , the initial instigator in this round of conflict , has ravaged Israel by killing , wounding , taking hostages , and destroying property . Its methods involved breaching the border fence and launching attacks , primarily against civilians and some military targets , often accompanied by rocket fire aimed at cities and towns , including capital Tel Aviv . In response , Israel hit back primarily with air power , triggering a major humanitarian crisis in Gaza . Information has the power to create , shift , or sustain already held beliefs . Beliefs , in turn , influence and determine individual and collective behaviours and are often shaped by the narratives at play . In the ongoing Hamas Israel war , the battle of narratives could play a crucial role in determining the course of events , including the cessation or continuation of hostilities . Also read : How Gaza hospital blast united Arab world against Israel amid Tel Aviv attempts to normalise ties Information warfare is on The tragic events in the Gaza Israel conflict are being beamed on the internet for the rest of the world . The power of images is understandably influencing beliefs , shaping narratives and driving global responses from governments and the public . These narratives are layered upon the backdrop of ongoing geopolitical turbulence , which is , essentially , a power struggle between the US and China that seeks to reshape the existing world order dominated by US led Western powers . Not surprisingly , the United Nations remains a bystander in efforts to end the violence in the Israel Gaza war . There are now two major global hotspots Ukraine in Eastern Europe and Israel Palestine in the Middle East . The Gaza Israel War is deeply rooted in history and carries within it the powerful force of religion , which has forever unleashed the beast in humankind . The spike in global support for the Palestinian cause , especially in the Arab world , is fanned by religious ties rooted in Islam . The ghosts of narratives regarding Islam historical confrontations with Christianity and Judaism in the Middle East have inevitably been galvanised . The recent bombing of the al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza city is emblematic of the ongoing battle of narratives being waged to portray the other as responsible for the loss of hundreds of innocent lives , that too of the injured and refugees fleeing from the scourge of war . It does not matter what the truth is , whether Israel version is supported by the US and its allies or the Hamas group was responsible . What matters to the popular imagination is the intrinsically crystallised political , ideological , and cultural disposition that colour their perceptive lenses . For those of the Islamic faith , the Hamas version reinforces their existing beliefs about Israel beastliness . For Israel , the US and its partners , it is a Hamas conspiracy driven by the manipulation of social media to garner sympathy and support . The surge in demonstrations , protests , and violence in the West Bank , several Arab countries , and other parts of the world against Israel reflects the truism that , in the battle of narratives , Hamas has succeeded in distancing the Arab world from Israel and rekindling support for the Palestinian cause , which had been forsaken by their Islamic brethren in the Arab world in recent years . The separate peace making efforts of the US and China to reconcile Saudi Arabia Israel and Iran Saudi Arabia have suffered a major blow . This does not bode well for global stability , even as the war continues to spread and escalate . Geographically , Israel border with Lebanon has seen cross border skirmishes , with reports of Iranian backed Hezbollah seeking to open another front against Israel . Israel has struck international airports in Syrian cities of Damascus and Aleppo , ostensibly to prevent Iran from supplying personnel , arms , and ammunition to Lebanon and Syria . Reports indicate that Iran backed militias have deployed to southern Lebanon and southwestern Syria . Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian has warned of a multi front war against Israel , and Iranian backed militias may take preemptive actions . However , Iran continues to signal its unwillingness to enter into a direct war with Israel . The US has deployed two aircraft carrier groups in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Israel to deter Iran . The Pentagon spokesperson has acknowledged a spate of drone attacks on American bases in Iraq and Syria and stated that an American destroyer in the Red Sea intercepted cruise missiles and drones launched by Iran supported Houthis in Yemen against Israel . Also read : Palestine issue will become excuse to ask Muslims to leave India Jamiat chief at pro Palestine meet Challenges for India US President Joe Biden recent visit to Israel signified support for the country but he also cautioned Israel not to repeat the mistakes committed by America after when it allowed anger and a desire for revenge to dictate its actions . Yet , Israel continues to wreak havoc in Gaza , which can only result in strengthening the cycle of revenge apart from uniting the West Bank and Gaza . The West Bank could become a third front if Israel launches an invasion there . Given its losses in the information domain , Israel would be able to retain American support due to the US internal politics . But reactions of others may differ and may not favour Israel . The question is : what should be India reaction ? Initially , India stance appeared skewed in favour of Israel when Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on 10 October following a telephone conversation with his Israeli counterpart , Benjamin Netanyahu : Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel . Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families . We stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour . This reaction pertained only to the terrorist attack on Israel . But some believed that India , under Modi , had prioritised its relationship with Israel at the expense of its traditional support for the Palestinian cause . The contents of the PM tweet were somewhat balanced by MEA spokesman Arindam Bagchi on 12 October in reply to a media query . He reaffirmed that India longstanding support for the Palestinian cause remains unchanged . The larger point is that the initial impression has remained in the popular imagination , and for some , India initial position was anchored in the ruling BJP stance against Islam a fact that has been on display on Indian social media platforms . An article in Al Jazeera reveals that after the Hamas attack on 7 October , numerous right leaning accounts in India spread Islamophobic disinformation . The article quotes the editor of the Indian non profit fact checking website , AltNews : With India now exporting its disinformation actors in the Indian mainstream media and on social media in support of Israel , hopefully the world will now realise how the Indian right wing has made India the disinformation capital of the world . These developments must be viewed as part of the information warfare playing out , which fuels communal divisions in India domestic politics . The Israel Hamas conflict is likely to add to the challenges India faces in navigating the turbulent geopolitical times . For starters , the proposed India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor IMEC seems dead in the surrounding waters . It is also likely that the sails of some terrorist groups adversarial to India will be boosted by the winds of geopolitical emotions generated by the Hamas Israel war . These could find expression in Kashmir in carrying out terrorist attacks on sensitive targets , especially those with religious significance . India must prepare for harder times , as the information domain gains prominence and AI driven technology makes it nearly impossible to discern fact from fiction . Information , as the currency of power , is being wielded to exert greater control over populations in autocracies . In democracies , the enhancement in exposure and the rapid flow of information provides ample room for radicalisation , especially when issues carry religious undertones . It is becoming increasingly feasible to manipulate beliefs and trick a large number of people for longer periods of time . The battle of narratives is finding a greater degree of success through disinformation , deceit , deception , and propaganda , injecting hate and hostility into an increasingly polarised world .

AFP Macron gave no details on how the coalition of dozens of countries , of which Israel is not a member , could be involved . His advisers said , however , that the coalition participation would not necessarily imply boots on the ground , but could include intelligence sharing .

The led coalition fighting Islamic State was formed in September 2014 . Macron office said the idea was to draw inspiration from the coalition and that France was available to discuss with Israel and partners what could be relevant against Hamas . \" The international coalition against Daesh does not limit itself to operations on the ground , but is also involved in the training of Iraqi forces , the sharing of information between partners , and the fight against terrorism funding , \" it said .

              " 'What Aid Groups Say Gaza Needs On Wednesday evening , Gaza is expected to run out of fuel . Cars and ambulances will no longer be able to reach hospitals ; generators and water pumping stations will cease working ; humanitarian efforts on the ground will collapse , aid workers tell TIME . For the first time since Israel began launching airstrikes in Gaza , in retaliation to Hamas surprise attack on 7 that killed people in Israel , 20 trucks carrying essential aid were allowed to pass through the Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza on Saturday . A further 34 trucks of aid have since entered Gaza and are solely being administered by the , whose biggest agency on the ground is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East UNRWA . But experts say the deliveries first brokered by the and containing food , medicine , and other medical supplies are a drop in the bucket of what Gazans need . Read More : The Gaza Healthcare System Is Reportedly on the Brink of Collapse It a glimmer of light but it not enough , Juliette Touma , director of communications for UNRWA , tells TIME from Amman , Jordan , where she has recently moved to from East Jerusalem . If we do have fuel , Gaza will collapse . The people of Gaza will collapse , and the largest humanitarian operation which is run by UNRWA will come to a halt , Touma says . She adds that fuel is needed to keep the bakeries that are feeding people and the hospitals open , both of which are struggling . At least Palestinians have been killed since Israel began launching airstrikes in the enclave , which is one of the most densely populated places on Earth . But Gaza has long faced a humanitarian crisis ; the Strip has been under a 16 year blockade before the latest escalation . As a result , million Gazans were already relying on food assistance from UNRWA . Amid global calls for a ceasefire , and the fight to establish a permanent humanitarian aid corridor , here what to know about aid efforts into Gaza . Read More : As War Rages in Gaza , Violence Surges in the West Bank How much aid went to Gaza before the war ? Before the Israel Hamas war broke out , Gaza million citizens required an average of 500 trucks of aid and fuel per day from a number of organizations . Such deliveries took place at Israel Kerem Shalom crossing point , while the Erez crossing point was used by aid workers , a small number of Palestinians working in Israel , and Gazans with a permit to seek health services in Israel . Aid typically included food and water assistance , as well as health and education services . UNICEF has been providing health material medicine and that includes , for example , the support to frontline clinics , support to rehabilitation of primary health care units . That also includes the creation of a neonatal unit in one of Gaza Hospitals , Jonathan Cricks , a spokesperson for UNICEF , tells TIME . He adds that the organization also supported Gazans with mental health and psychosocial needs , citing UNICEF figures that children have needed these services since 2008 . One of the most vital lifelines UNICEF and other organizations provide is safe drinking water . There is a desalination plant that was developed and when it fully functioning it is supposed to provide potable , safe water for people , Cricks says . The lack of electricity and fuel has left Gazans to ration three liters gallons of water per day for cleaning , cooking , and drinking , well below then the international standard of 15 liters gallons needed in an emergency situation , according to the World Health Organization . Cricks adds that UNICEF has water and hygiene kits waiting at the Egyptian border ready to enter when more trucks are approved . Meanwhile , UNRWA which operates across Gaza , the West Bank and East Jerusalem , Syria , Lebanon , and Jordan also runs 700 schools across the region . We give an education to more than half a million boys and girls , Touma says . Some of these schools in Gaza are now acting as a refuge for people who have lost their homes during airstrikes . The major organizations who administer aid and humanitarian services in Gaza are the World Health Organization , the World Food Programme , the Red Cross , the Red Crescent , and Doctors Without Borders . UNRWA remains the largest humanitarian operation on the ground . How is aid administered in Gaza ? Aid previously entered the Gaza Strip via Israel Kerem Shalom crossing point . But aid organizations have had to quickly establish new routes via Egypt Rafah crossing following the Israel Hamas war . It a very complex logistics operation , Touma says . The overall , and other humanitarian organizations , have to set up this operation almost from scratch . Read More : Our Death Is Pending . Stories of Loss and Grief From Gaza When trucks enter Gaza , the is responsible for the distribution of supplies , Touma says . It a lot of physical work . It actually quite dangerous for our own staff to do this because they doing this sometimes late at night , sometimes during the bombardments and the airstrikes , Touma says . Some 35 of UNRWA colleagues stationed in Gaza have been confirmed as killed by airstrikes . So far , food , bottled water , and some medicine have been received and administered . Israel has warned that aid deliveries will once again be halted if supplies are seized by Hamas , which controls the Gaza Strip . But Touma says UNRWA who has been on the ground for seven decades and built local trust operates on a strict scrutiny system for aid distribution . Deliveries are monitored and audited so they reach the vulnerable , she adds . What are humanitarian organizations calling for ? Touma warns that UNRWA has been in a deep financial crisis for the best part of a decade . This has left the agency with little to no reserves for an unprecedented crisis like the one unfolding now in Gaza . Donations from around the world are rising as the death toll in Gaza surges . But aid officials tell TIME they are only helpful if they can continuously reach those in need . As such , most humanitarian groups are calling for a sustained route into Gaza to deliver vital aid . UNICEF resources have quickly depleted , says Cricks . That why we are asking for a humanitarian corridor that is safe and sustained , he adds . Touma says that there are efforts taking place at the highest level of the to advocate for a regular and sustained supply of aid and fuel into Gaza . There are also efforts to reach a humanitarian ceasefire , she says .',\n",

              " 'EU leaders urge pauses in Gaza bombing to get aid in BRUSSELS : EU leaders called on Thursday for pauses in Israeli bombing and Hamas rocket attacks to get humanitarian aid into Gaza after days of wrangling that highlighted divisions within the bloc over the broader Israel Palestinian conflict . In a declaration agreed at a summit in Brussels , the leaders of the Union 27 nations expressed the \" gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza \" . They called for \" continued , rapid , safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs \" . The summit was the leaders first in person meeting since the deadly 7 assault on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas , which prompted Israel to bombard and blockade Hamas run Gaza . While EU leaders have strongly condemned Hamas attack , they have struggled to stick to the same message beyond that , with some stressing Israel right to self defence and others emphasising concern about Palestinian civilians . The leaders differences were still clear as they arrived for the summit . \" Israel is a democratic state guided by very humanitarian principles and so we can be certain that the Israeli army will respect the rules that arise from international law in everything it does , \" said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz . \" I have no doubt about that . \" Scholz remarks contrasted sharply with comments in recent days by EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and Charles Michel , the chairman of EU leaders summits , who have said that a total blockade of Gaza and attacks on civilian infrastructure already contravene international law . Rights groups such as have also accused Israel of violating international humanitarian law . Israel insists it is acting within international law and that its attacks are intended to destroy Hamas , which operates among the civilian population . Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo warned Israel against starving Gaza . \" Israel has a right to take action and to prevent future attacks . But that is never an excuse for blocking a whole region , for blocking humanitarian aid . It can not be an excuse to starve a population , \" he said . PAUSE VERSUS PAUSES Ahead of the summit , diplomats spent days debating whether to call for a \" humanitarian pause \" or \" pauses \" . Countries such as France , the Netherlands , Spain , Portugal , Belgium and Ireland had endorsed calls from the for a break in the conflict for humanitarian reasons . But others such as Germany , the Czech Republic and Austria resisted , arguing such a measure could curb Israel ability to defend itself and let Hamas regroup , according to diplomats . The compromise on \" pauses \" in the plural was meant to signal short breaks in fighting for missions such as hostage releases or aid convoys , rather than a formal ceasefire , diplomats said . While the EU influence on the conflict is modest , the bloc fears that an escalation could have grave consequences for Europe , including a rise in tensions between communities , possible Islamist militant attacks and a flow of refugees . The crisis erupted with the EU already grappling with the fallout from another war in its immediate neigbourhood the conflict triggered by Russia invasion of Ukraine . Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the summit by video link as the EU leaders pledged they will continue to support Ukraine even amidst another major crisis . \" We must clearly see this scenario of a larger fire in the Middle East and counter it together , \" Zelenskiy said . \" The sooner security prevails in the Middle East , the sooner we will restore security here in Europe . \" Some officials and diplomats have voiced fears that Ukraine may now struggle to get the same political attention and resources from the West , particularly the United States , due to the new crisis in the Middle East .',\n",

              " 'What do we know about Israeli captives taken by Hamas and their release ? More than 200 people , including civilians and military personnel , are still being held in different locations in Gaza . More than 200 people are believed to be held captive by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza after the deadly attacks inside Israel on October 7 . Hamas said the attacks , which killed more than Israelis , were aimed at ending Israeli violations at the Al Aqsa Mosque compound , Islam third holiest site , and to secure the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons . Since then , Israel has been pounding Gaza with nonstop aerial strikes , killing about people , including children , and has been preparing for a ground offensive . So what do we know about the captives , and how many of them have been released ? What are the chances for the release of the others ? What do we know about Israel planned offensive ? Who are they ? The latest figure given by Israel military on Monday was 222 people , including military personnel , were being held captive in the besieged enclave . Hamas has said more than 20 captives have been killed by Israeli air strikes . The murdered and the missing come from over 30 countries , including the United Kingdom , British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told lawmakers this month . We do have all the details about the captives yet , but officials from different countries have provided some information . Israeli authorities have not publicly named the captives so far , but a considerable number are believed to be military officers . Some are believed to be children and the elderly . At least 10 United States citizens are still unaccounted for and are believed to be held in Gaza , according to officials . Two US nationals were released on Friday after Qatari mediation . Thailand believes it has 17 nationals among the captives , and at least eight are Germans . Seven British nationals and seven French citizens are still classified as missing , and some are believed to be held captive . Argentina and the Netherlands have also said they have citizens held in Gaza . Who has been released ? Four people held in Gaza have so far been released by Hamas , keeping hopes alive that others may also be freed . On Friday , a mother and daughter from Chicago who also hold Israeli citizenship were released . Natalie Raanan , 17 , and her mother , Judith , 59 , were transferred to Egypt through the Rafah crossing with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC . They met with Israeli security forces in Egypt and were transferred to a military base in Israel to be reunited with their family . We facilitated the release of 2 more hostages , transporting them out of Gaza this evening . Our role as a neutral intermediary makes this work possible we are ready to facilitate any future release . We hope that they will soon be back with their loved ones . ICRC October 23 , 2023 Qatari and Egyptian mediation led to the release of two elderly Israeli women late on Monday . Yokheved Lifshitz and Nurit Yitzhak , also known as Nurit Cooper , were released on humanitarian grounds , according to Hamas . The 85 year old Lifshitz said at a news conference on Tuesday that she was hurt during the abduction but was treated well during captivity . Both women husbands remain captives . Hamas has claimed it treats the captives as guests . Will others be freed ? Hamas has said it wanted to release some of the captives without conditions but Israel rejected the offer . Tel Aviv has denied this claim . Israeli media have reported that Hamas may be on the verge of releasing more than 50 captives as advanced talks are held with Israel , which had said as it ramped up its bombing campaign that it would not talk with the terrorist organisation . Reports have indicated Hamas has demanded Israel allow fuel into Gaza , a request also made by human rights organisations as hospitals are fighting to keep the lights on for thousands of wounded Palestinians . Al Jazeera , however , could not confirm the veracity of the Israeli media reports . In addition to Qatar and Egypt , Turkey may also emerge as a mediator after its foreign minister , Hakan Fidan , said the US and several European countries have asked for help . In addition to talking to their governments , families have taken to social media to plead for help . There have also been rallies in several countries during which demonstrators have called for the captives release . The US has sent a small special operations team to help the Israeli military , but any rescue operation would be risky . Israelis and Palestinians have a history of taking captives , and Israel has doubled its number of Palestinian prisoners to since the Hamas attacks this month . The most high profile case of a prisoner exchange took place in 2011 when Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit , who was taken five years earlier , was swapped for Palestinian prisoners . What about the ground offensive ? Israel , which has been amassing troops and equipment on the Gaza border , said on Tuesday that a plan for a ground assault is still very much on the agenda and its military is ready to launch it despite Iranian warnings that this will escalate the war . However , reports indicated that US President Joe Biden has asked Israel to hold off on the attack until the captives are released , saying there is no higher priority at the moment . Meanwhile , The New York Times reported on Monday that US officials are not confident the Israeli military is ready for a ground invasion and can not hope for tangible results . The US based news outlet Axios on Tuesday quoted two unnamed Israeli officials as saying they are willing to delay the ground offensive for a few days to allow for more talks on the captives . Experts have said a ground offensive would carry high risks for the captives because there is no exact information on where they are being held and as many of them are believed to be held in a large network of underground tunnels beneath Gaza . Much of northern Gaza has been levelled by Israeli bombing , and a ground war is expected to be difficult and unforgiving .',\n",

The United States should stop supporting genocide in Gaza and Palestine , Iranian FM Hossein Amir Abdollahian told the UNGA on Thursday morning at the start of a two day debate . function addVidazooScript vidazoo script \" ; const div \" ; let scp \" ; ; widget id , ; , ; ; const isSafari ; yes , no safari \" ; addVidazooScript ; no , yes safari \" ; Some 109 nations out of the UN 193 member states were expected to take the floor to speak about a resolution put forward by Jordan on the need for a humanitarian ceasefire to the war which has captivated international attention over the last 20 days . Abdollahian in his remarks in support of the Palestinians also addressed the potential of the Gaza War to become an open conflict between Iran and the United States . Advertisement Today in New York and in the UN , I say frankly to the American statesmen who are now managing the genocide in Palestine that we do not welcome the expansion of the war in the region . Israel Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan attends a meeting of the Security Council on the conflict between Israel and Hamas , at headquarters in New York , , October 25 , 2023 credit : REUTERS David Dee Delgado Iran warns the US But I warn if the genocide in Palestine will continue they will not be spared from this fire , it is our home and West Asia is our region , Abdollahian said . Advertisement We have no reservation when it comes to our home security , he said . The resolution does not condemn Hamas for massacring over people and taking more than 224 of them hostage during its assault on southern Israel on October 7 that sparked the war . Some 33 countries have citizens among the dead and the missing . Advertisement Jordan , on behalf of the Arab Group , turned to the UNGA with a resolution on the matter after it became clear that American Russian rivalry would prevent the United Nations Security Council from issuing any joint statement on the conflict . The resolution , which calls for the release of the hostages and the need to protect all civilians , focuses primarily on helping the Palestinians in Gaza , where Hamas asserts that close to have died since the start of the war . Israel has not provided any casualty figures from Gaza but has said that deaths there are the result of IDF bombings and failed Palestinian rocket launches . The UNGA resolution is non binding but serves as a form of international referendum on public opinion at the diplomatic level on the war . Abdollahian described Hamas as a Palestinian liberation movement and justified the Hamas October 7 attack on Israel . Hamas , he said , is fighting the occupation and has a legitimate right to use all means , including violence to support that cause . He also compared the Hamas hostages with Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli jails . According to our negotiations , Hamas is ready to release civilian prisoners . The world should support the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons , Abdollahian said . Hamas has voiced its readiness to lease the non military prisoner to us , Abdollahian said . Iran stands ready to play its part in this very important humanitarian endeavor along with Qatar and Turkey , he added . Israel ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan , who spoke before Abdollahian , accused Iran of masterminding the October 7 attack . Iran trained , funded , and armed Hamas to execute the assault , Erdan said . The Islamic Republic has the blood of thousands of Israelis and hundreds of thousands of its own citizens on its hands , as well as the blood of Ukrainians , Americans , and Emiratis , he said . Given its role as the number one state sponsor of terrorism , Abdollahian should have been barred from addressing the UNGA , he stated . The country with a Nazi ideology of annihilating Israel stands in solidarity with it proxy Hamas , which shares the same Nazi ideology and aims for our destruction , Erdan said . This man , this mass murderer , or any other representative of the terror regime in Iran , has no place at the UN , let alone in the family of nations ! Erdan added .',\n",

A spin off of the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood in the late , the Islamist militant group Hamas took over the Gaza Strip after defeating its rival political party , Fatah , in elections in 2006 . Introduction Hamas is an Islamist militant movement and one of the Palestinian territories two major political parties . It governs more than two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip , but the group is best known for its armed resistance to Israel . In October 2023 , Hamas launched a massive surprise attack on southern Israel , killing hundreds of civilians and soldiers and taking dozens more as hostages . Israel has declared war on the group in response and indicated its military is planning for a long campaign to defeat it . Dozens of countries have designated Hamas a terrorist organization , though some apply this label only to its military wing . Iran provides it with material and financial support , and Turkey reportedly harbors some of its top leaders . Its rival party , Fatah , which dominates the Palestine Liberation Organization PLO and rules in the West Bank , has renounced violence . The split in Palestinian leadership and Hamas unwavering hostility toward Israel have diminished prospects for stability in Gaza . What are the group origins ? Hamas , an acronym for Harakat al Muqawama al Islamiya Islamic Resistance Movement , was founded by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , a Palestinian cleric who became an activist in local branches of the Muslim Brotherhood after dedicating his early life to Islamic scholarship in Cairo . Beginning in the late , Yassin preached and performed charitable work in the West Bank and Gaza , both of which Israel occupied following the 1967 Six Day War . Yassin established Hamas as the Brotherhood political arm in Gaza in December 1987 , following the outbreak of the first intifada , a Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank , Gaza , and East Jerusalem . At the time , Hamas purpose was to counter Palestinian Islamic Jihad PIJ , another organization whose commitment to violently resisting Israel threatened to draw Palestinians support away from the Brotherhood . In 1988 , Hamas published its charter , calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic society in historic Palestine . In what observers called an attempt to moderate its image , Hamas presented a new document PDF in 2017 that accepted an interim Palestinian state along the Green Line border established before the Six Day War but that still refused to recognize Israel . Hamas first employed suicide bombing in April 1993 , five months before PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the Oslo Accords . The historic pact established limited self government for parts of the West Bank and Gaza under a newly created entity called the Palestinian Authority PA . Hamas condemned the accords , as well as the PLO and Israel recognition of each other , which Arafat and Rabin officially agreed to in letters sent days before Oslo . In 1997 , the United States designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organization . The movement went on to spearhead violent resistance during the second intifada , in the early , though PIJ and Fatah Tanzim militia were also responsible for violence against Israelis . Who are its leaders ? Hamas has a host of leadership bodies that perform various political , military , and social functions . General policy is set by an overarching consultative body , often called the politburo , which operates in exile . Local committees manage grassroots issues in Gaza and the West Bank . Ismail Haniyeh currently serves as political chief , having replaced longtime leader Khaled Meshaal in 2017 . Haniyeh has operated from Doha , Qatar , since 2020 , reportedly because Egypt restricts his movement into and out of Gaza . Hamas leaders established a presence in Qatar after falling out with their previous host , Syria , when Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War . Some senior Hamas figures reportedly operate out of the group offices in Turkey . Day to day affairs in Gaza are overseen by Yahya Sinwar , who previously headed Hamas military wing and served twenty two years in an Israeli prison for masterminding the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers . He was among the more than one thousand Palestinian prisoners freed in 2011 in exchange for an Israeli soldier held by Hamas . As of June 2021 , Gaza de facto prime minister is Issam al . Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif command Hamas military wing , the Izz ad Din al Qassam Brigades . Israeli forces assassinated the militia founder , Salah Shehadeh , in a 2002 air strike . Fifteen civilians were killed in the attack , focusing Israeli and international scrutiny on such tactics . Israeli forces killed Yassin , Hamas founder , in 2004 . Saleh al Arouri reportedly heads Hamas Lebanon branch . He also took over the group West Bank leadership following internal elections that concluded in 2021 , while Meshaal was chosen to lead the diaspora office and Salameh Katawi was elected to manage the affairs of imprisoned Hamas members . How is Hamas funded ? As a designated terrorist entity , Hamas is cut off from official assistance that the United States and European Union EU provide to the PLO in the West Bank . Historically , Palestinian expatriates and private donors in the Persian Gulf provided much of the movement funding . In addition , some Islamic charities in the West have channeled money to Hamas backed social service groups , prompting asset freezes by the Treasury . Gaza economic situation was already dire before Hamas 2023 assault on Israel , and the ensuing war is almost certain to exacerbate the extreme poverty of its residents . Egypt and Israel largely closed their borders with it in , restricting the movement of goods and people into and out of the territory . The two countries maintain a blockade today , cutting off the territory from most of the world and forcing more than one million Gazan Palestinians to rely on international aid . Israel has allowed Qatar to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance through Hamas . Other foreign aid generally reaches Gaza via the PA and UN agencies .

After Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al Sisi took power in 2013 , Cairo became hostile toward Hamas , which it saw as an extension of its chief domestic rival , the Muslim Brotherhood . The Egyptian army shut down most of the tunnels breaching its territory while it waged a counterterrorism campaign against a branch of the self proclaimed Islamic State on its side of the border , on the Sinai Peninsula . Egypt began to allow some commercial goods to enter Gaza through its Salah al Din border crossing in 2018 . As of 2021 , Hamas reportedly collected upward of 12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported into Gaza . Today , Iran is one of Hamas biggest benefactors , contributing funds , weapons , and training . Though Iran and Hamas briefly fell out after backing opposing sides in Syria civil war , Iran currently provides some 100 million annually PDF to Hamas , PIJ , and other Palestinian groups designated as terrorist organizations by the United States . Iran was quick to praise Hamas assault on Israel in late 2023 and pledge its continuing support for the Palestinian group . Turkey has been another stalwart backer of Hamas and a critic of Israel following President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rise to power in 2002 . Though Ankara insists it only supports Hamas politically , it has been accused of funding Hamas terrorism , including through aid diverted from the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency . How does it govern Gaza ? Hamas has been the de facto authority in Gaza since shortly after Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005 . The following year , Hamas won a majority of seats in the PA legislature and formed a government . It earned votes for the social services it provided and as a rejection of the incumbent Fatah , which many voters perceived as having grown corrupt at the helm of the PLO and delivering little to Palestinians through its negotiations with Israel . The outcome was unacceptable to Fatah and its Western backers , and the party ousted Hamas from power in the West Bank . In Gaza , Hamas routed Fatah militias in a week of fighting , resulting in a political schism between the two Palestinian territories . Palestinians have not voted for a legislature since 2006 , nor a president since 2008 . The Hamas controlled government has no effective or independent mechanisms for ensuring transparency in its funding , procurements , or operations . Freedom House As Hamas took over the remnants of PA institutions in the strip , it established a judiciary and put in place authoritarian institutions . In theory , Hamas governs in accordance with the sharia based Palestinian Basic Law , as does the PA ; but it has generally been more restrictive than the law requires , including by controlling how women dress and enforcing gender segregation in public during the early years of its rule . The watchdog group Freedom House found in 2020 that the Hamas controlled government has no effective or independent mechanisms for ensuring transparency in its funding , procurements , or operations . Hamas also represses the Gazan media , civilian activism on social media , the political opposition , and nongovernmental organizations NGOs , leaving it without mechanisms for accountability . How do Palestinians view Hamas ? The political bifurcation of the West Bank and Gaza is widely unpopular : a June 2023 poll PDF by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research PCPSR showed that one third of Palestinians consider it the most damaging development for their people since the state of Israel 1948 creation . The same poll found that more than half of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank would vote for Hamas Haniyeh over PA President Mahmoud Abbas in a presidential election , while just one third of Palestinians would choose Abbas . Additionally , Abbas has indefinitely postponed national elections scheduled for 2021 , citing Israel alleged refusal to let Palestinians in East Jerusalem vote , though observers suspect that Abbas aims to prevent a likely Hamas victory . How has Hamas challenged Israel ? Hamas has fired rockets and mortars into Israel since the group took over the Gaza Strip in the mid . Iranian security officials have said that Tehran provided some of these weapons , but that Hamas gained the ability to build its own missiles after training with Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC and proxies . In recent years , Israel estimated that Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza had about thirty thousand rockets and mortars in their arsenal . Hamas militants have flown balloons carrying incendiary devices toward Israel , which have sometimes caused fires . The group has also carried out incursions into Israeli territory , killing and kidnapping soldiers and civilians . Prior to the 2023 conflict , Hamas and Israel had their deadliest fighting in years in 2021 , when Hamas fired rockets into Israel following weeks of tensions between Palestinians and Israelis in Jerusalem . Some analysts say that Hamas wanted to bolster its reputation as the defender of the Palestinian cause after the PA postponed the 2021 elections . During the eleven day conflict , Hamas and PIJ fired more than four thousand rockets from Gaza , killing ten Israeli civilians and injuring more than three hundred others . Hamas reportedly coordinated with the IRGC and Lebanon Hezbollah during the fighting , and used so called suicide drones along with its usual arsenal of less precise missiles . The United States and Egypt brokered a cease fire to the conflict . How is Hamas attack on Israel in 2023 different ? Hamas assault on southern Israel this year , which the group leaders have called Operation Al Aqsa Storm , was extraordinary in its strategy , scale , and secrecy , analysts say . It began early in the morning on October 7 , the Jewish Sabbath and an important Jewish holiday , with Hamas launching several thousand rockets into southern and central Israel , hitting cities as far north as Tel Aviv . Hamas militants also breached the heavily fortified Gaza border and infiltrated many southern Israeli towns and villages , killing hundreds of Israeli troops and civilians , and wounding and kidnapping scores more . Hamas military leader , Mohammed Deif , said the group undertook its assault because of Israel long running blockade of Gaza , its occupation of Palestinian lands , and its alleged crimes against Muslims , including the desecration of Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem . It is the deadliest attack on Israeli soil in decades and has inflicted a deep psychological trauma on the Israeli people , with some analysts drawing comparisons to the surprise Pearl Harbor and September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States . Israeli and intelligence agencies reportedly had no indications that Hamas was planning an assault of this nature . It is completely unprecedented that a terrorist organization would have the capacity or the wherewithal to mount coordinated , simultaneous assaults from the air , sea , and land , writes CFR Senior Fellow Bruce Hoffman . Israel has declared war on Hamas and countered with intensifying air strikes on targets in Gaza and ground operations to push the group militants out of the country . The government has ordered the evacuation of all civilians from Israeli communities bordering Gaza . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned of a long and difficult war against Hamas , and Israel military response is expected to be extraordinary , if not unprecedented . Some observers are questioning if Israel will attempt a full scale invasion and reoccupation of the Palestinian territory , a campaign that could incur heavy casualties on both sides . Israel had mounted numerous military operations against Hamas since its takeover in 2007 , two years after Israel pulled out of Gaza . But these were mostly from the air . And even when Israeli troops were deployed , they never stayed for long , writes CFR Senior Fellow Max Boot for the Washington Post . An Israeli invasion of Gaza could also provoke a significant attack against Israel by Hezbollah , the Iran backed militant group in Lebanon , risking a wider conflagration in the region , analysts say . Iran is , of course , a patron of Hezbollah as well as Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups and there is an ever present danger of a two front conflict , which would devastate parts of Israel and much of Lebanon , where Hezbollah is based . There is a risk of escalation , says CFR Senior Fellow Steven Cook .',\n",

              " 'Regional Spillover : Blasts hit two Egyptian Red Sea towns CAIRO : Projectiles hit two Egyptian Red Sea towns on Friday injuring several people , sources and officials said , showing the risk of regional spillover from the Israel Gaza conflict . The explosions hit Taba on the border with Israel and Nuweiba about 70 km 43 miles further away , two Egyptian security sources told Reuters , saying they were still gathering more information .

Witnesses in both places , who asked not to be named , confirmed explosions and smoke rising . Israel military said it was aware of a security incident outside its borders . Taba and Nuweiba , both in Egypt Sinai Peninsula , are popular with tourists . Bordering both Gaza and Israel , Egypt is exposed to the conflict that blew up after Hamas 7 assault on Israel and the subsequent bombardment of the Gaza Strip .

              " 'India Digital Footprint on the Israel Gaza War Advertisement In the wake of the Israel conflict , Aditya Raj Kaul , an Indian journalist known for his pro BJP views , posted on X formerly Twitter about the atrocities committed by Hamas , alleging that a pregnant woman was dissected by Hamas , killing the unborn child . As of writing , the post has been viewed million times with more than retweets , including one from Ben Shapiro , who disseminated it to his large following . However , this story remains unverified . The Israel Palestine conflict was a hotbed for conspiracies and false information even before the current flashpoint . While researchers so far have found minimal evidence of disinformation of foreign origin , the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has nonetheless observed a surge in misinformation . This reveals the significance and salience of the digital battlefield in modern day warfare and combat , engaging the participation of citizens beyond the Middle East in a battle of discourse and ideology . Amid this fragmented information sphere , the manufacture of and engagement with pro Israel content among Indian nationals , more significantly among right wing Hindu nationalists , have not escaped popular attention . Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter Get briefed on the story of the week , and developing stories to watch across the Asia Pacific . Get the Newsletter BOOM , a reputable Indian fact checking service , found several verified Indian X users at the front and center of a disinformation campaign that targets Palestine with negative news while supporting Israel . In one instance , a video purporting to show young girls taken by a Palestinian fighter as sex slaves was circulated on This video had no context and was likely from a school trip to Jerusalem , but this was shared widely by Indian accounts . Enjoying this article ? Click here to subscribe for full access . Fact checker Pratik Sinha has referred to India as the disinformation capital of the world due to the rise of right wing nationalism in the country . There have been attempts to attribute the spread of false information in India on the Israel Gaza conflict to the BJP IT Cell , a department within the ruling party that handles its social media accounts and campaigns . However , beyond the element of state sponsorship in the spread of and disinformation , this episode reveals wider trends surrounding fake news and grassroots engagement in the production , dissemination , and export of misinformation in India . The Politics of India Israel The links drawn between India and Israel are not new . Ideological resonance has been observed for a long time between the two countries , and this has grown in recent years with the rise of a more muscular Hindu nationalism in India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Advertisement Scholars have identified the solidarity and affinity among Hindu nationals in India for the Israeli cause , pointing to heavy ideological resonance between Hindutva and Zionism . Madhav Golwalkar , former head of the BJP ideological wing , the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh RSS , articulated a vision of the Hindu nation emphasizing the racialized notion of a state , drawing parallels with Zionism . This understanding of the Hindu nation has continued to influence the current BJP government under Modi , manifesting in policies like the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act CAA , which has been compared to Israel discriminatory Law of Return . Both measures grant citizenship rights to ethnic majority individuals beyond the state while denying Muslims within the state citizenship rights . For Hindu nationalists , the religious significance of Israel sovereignty serves as an aspirational model . More recently , Modi departed from India usual neutrality in conflicts , which was maintained in the ongoing Russia Ukraine war , by issuing a strong statement of support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in response to Hamas attacks . This move reflects the close diplomatic ties established between Modi and Netanyahu since 2014 , with Modi being the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel and Netanyahu calling him a kindred spirit . This camaraderie has set the tone for India Israel relations , and India economic and strategic ties with Israel are increasingly apparent . While India Ministry of External Affairs MEA asserts that India recognizes and supports the Palestinian cause and advocates for the resumption of direct negotiations towards establishing a sovereign , independent , and viable State of Palestine living within secure and recognised borders , side by ide at peace with Israel , Modi leanings toward Israel reflects what has been called his biggest ideological departure from Congress on Middle East policy . The Right Wing Digital Network The transnational nature of right wing ethnonationalist affinities presents the possibility to observe and study right wing nationalism as a network . This virtual ecosystem has become the fertile ground for normalization and dissemination of hate , fueling calls for violence within these networks . Within Israel , there is an observed normalization of right wing extremist views within Netanyahu new coalition , which features the inclusion of the far right in the government . This right wing allyship can also be seen in Israel embrace of far right movements across Europe and in the strengthening ties between India and Israel . Enjoying this article ? Click here to subscribe for full access . In reflection of this solidarity , Israeli Ambassador to India Naor Gilon congratulated India on its Cricket World Cup win over Pakistan , announcing on X that he is glad that Pakistan would now be unable to achieve a victory that it would have attributed to Hamas . Gilon also added an emotional note , thanking Indian friends for showing their solidarity with Israel by displaying posters during the match . Worryingly , this camaraderie has trickled down to the populace . Beyond the political sphere , the right wing nationalist network serves as a social phenomenon and a mobilizing force in society . The internet as a global civic space has facilitated the flourishing of digital populism , marked by the use of the internet for participation and mobilization , and the creation of an environment conducive for the circulation of nativist and xenophobic narratives . At the grassroots level , the pervasive impact of the rise of Hindutva can be seen in the prevalence of pro Israel sentiments among supporters of the Hindu right . These ideological affinities between Hindu nationalists and Israel manifested online long before the ongoing conflict . Since Modi assumed office in 2014 , it has become common to see tweets from Hindu nationalists expressing unwavering support for Israel and Netanyahu . This sentiment is often referred to as the India Israel brotherhood , and these expressions of support often go hand in hand with condemnations of Palestine , Pakistan , and even Muslims in general , further underscoring the shared ideological alignment between these two groups . Advertisement Grassroots Disinformation and the Right Wing Digital Network While this exploitation of international events to fuel domestic events is not new , what can be observed is the emergence of a voluntary and decentralized disinformation campaign by Hindu nationalists in support of Israel . Calling themselves digital champions of Israel , individual accounts with large followings push unverified one sided news against Hamas , which have gained substantial momentum online . This phenomenon has not escaped the attention of global netizens , and it has triggered an onslaught of memes and satirical content aimed at the Hindu nationalists vocal support for Israel . The fervor of Indian netizens for Israel was evident even before the recent escalation of violence . The recognition of said support has since been put on the record , with the official account of Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs thanking India after India is with Israel trended on Twitter . Disinformation and the right wing network are mutually reinforcing . First , disinformation utilizes narratives derived from this right wing network , with the success of the campaign riding on the highly emotive nature of right wing beliefs . As the current conflict unfolds , Israel intense retaliation toward Hamas and the deadly strikes against Gaza are being co opted by Hindu nationalists to advance their anti Muslim agenda . The intertwining of domestic politics with larger global issues has given fresh voice to the stoking of anti Muslim hate as narratives borrowed from a foreign conflict are used to justify the persecution of Muslims in India . Second , the spread of disinformation containing right wing narratives serves to circulate , perpetuate , and therefore reinforce rhetoric and motifs common and central to a variety of right wing and far right discourses . But the right wing network does not bear sole responsibility for the fragmented information landscape . The larger Israel Palestine conflict remains a highly affective one ; people of different cultures and creeds find themselves and their own experiences in one facet of the conflict or another . Individuals consume and thus perpetuate misleading information that bolsters their worldview , contributing to the onslaught of misinformation . The Ever Evolving Landscape of the Conflict Information Sphere Amid conflicting , partisan information , netizens , experts , and traditional media continue to debate who perpetrated the devastating bombing of the Al Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza . However , as of now , this remains undetermined . In a post on X , a user that claiming affiliation with Al Jazeera alleged that she witnessed a misfired Hamas rocket hitting the hospital . Al Jazeera later released a statement to clarify that said user has no ties to the network . Multiple X users have pointed out the user had previously only posted on Indian politics and cricket , only recently turning her attention to Gaza , insinuating her origin . As the violence in Gaza becomes increasingly egregious , Modi has conveyed his condolences at the loss of lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza , pledging that India will continue to send humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people . Indian netizens are divided on Modi stance , however , amid the ideological alignment and friendship with Netanyahu Israel . The dynamism of the unfolding events may thus see the pluralization of narratives and grassroots disinformation attempts targeted at both sides of conflict . But one thing is for certain : In the case of Indian social media , digital boots are continually deployed on the information battlefield .',\n",

              " 'Slovakia newly elected PM Robert Fico stops military aid to Ukraine . And its personal Slovakia newly elected Prime Minister Robert Fico on Thursday announced that they are stopping weapons delivery to Ukraine . A day after taking charge , Fico told lawmakers that Slovakia would \" no longer supply weapons to Ukraine \" and would only send humanitarian aid to Kyiv , AFP news agency reported . \" I will support zero military aid to Ukraine An immediate halt to military operations is the best solution we have for Ukraine , \" said Fico . \" The EU should change from an arms supplier to a peacemaker , \" he added . Fico further voiced his opposition to sanctions against Russia . I will not vote for any sanctions against Russia unless we see analyses of their impact on Slovakia , he said . If there are to be such sanctions that will harm us , like most sanctions have , I can see no reason to support them . In the run up to the elections , Fico had repeatedly pledged to halt military aid for Ukraine , after the previous Slovak governments shipped military hardware including fighter jets , an air defence system , and fighting and de mining vehicles to Ukraine . Russia response Russia immediately dismissed the impact Slovakia decision to halt military aid to Ukraine . \" Slovakia did not have such a big share in the supply of weapons , so it will hardly affect the entire process , \" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters , when asked about Bratislava decision . Slovakia volte face from pro Ukraine to pro Russia reflects Fico fractious personal relations with Kyiv that goes back at least a decade . Slovakia volte face In January 2009 , when Fico was the prime minister , Slovakia bore the brunt of a long running spat between Russia and Ukraine over natural gas , and the Russian gas flows across Ukraine to EU countries stopped , a crisis that Slovakia could afford to ignore in the middle of winter . The row over gas cost the Slovak economy around 100 million a day , reports Politico , as factories were forced to shut down . A desperate Fico then called both Vladimir Putin , who was the Russian prime minister at that time , and Ukrainian PM Yulia Tymoshenko to get the gas restarted . Later on January 14 , a Slovak delegation led by Fico landed in Kyiv to meet with the Ukrainian government . However , he was made to wait for hours . Three hours later , the delegation was taken to a meeting which was filled with the members of the press .

Why is this belief prevalent , and why do our host , Dev Goswami , and \" Def Savvy \" Abhishek Bhalla hold differing views on this ? What are the key differences and similarities between the situations of India and Israel ? Also , Israel has recently conducted a series of airstrikes on the Gaza Strip and issued an ultimatum for the evacuation of million civilians in northern Gaza . However , this ultimatum has expired without action yet . Given the evolving dynamics , will Israel consider a ground invasion due to growing threats from Hezbollah in the northern part and warnings from Iran about preemptive actions ? Will this invasion happen ? And will Israel be able to decimate Hamas amid such sort of pressure building against it ? If yes , what happens to Gaza then ? Listen in !

The Hamas controlled health ministry said on Wednesday that more than people including children have been killed in the narrow Palestinian territory since violence erupted . The attacks of the Zionist Israeli regime have reached an intensity that shows the goal is the mass killing of the Palestinian people in Gaza , Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian charged in a letter addressed to the United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk .

              " 'Why Is the Rafah Border Crossing So Important for Gaza ? After Israel imposed a complete siege of the Gaza Strip in response to the deadly 7 attack by Hamas , the strip border crossing with Egypt became even more critical , as the only point not controlled by Israel where civilians can enter and leave Gaza by land . But Egypt has kept the crossing , near the southern Gaza city of Rafah , sealed since 10 , as diplomatic negotiations to allow people and supplies pass dragged . The pressure to open it has increased as Israel prepares a possible ground invasion of Gaza , and as living conditions in the strip have deteriorated rapidly amid punishing Israeli airstrikes some of which have also hit the crossing . President Biden said on Wednesday that he had urged Israel to allow some humanitarian aid into Gaza and Israel said it would not block deliveries from Egypt , offering the first sign of relief to civilians in the enclave .

Standing next to Secretary of State Antony Blinken , Wang said the two countries share important common interests and challenges that they need to resolve together . \" Therefore , China and the United States need to have dialogue . Not only should we resume dialogue , the dialogue should be in depth and comprehensive , \" Wang said , speaking through an interpreter . Dialogue would help reduce misunderstandings , help stabilize the relationship and \" return it to the track of healthy , stable and sustainable development , \" he said . Blinken responded : \" I agree with what the foreign minister said . \" Before Wang spoke , Blinken had said he looked forward to constructive talks with his Chinese counterpart . During the meeting , Blinken expressed his condolences on the passing of China former premier , Li Keqiang . Wang three day visit is the latest in a flurry of diplomatic engagements between the two strategic rivals as they seek to manage their differences to avoid conflict . The trip primarily is to prepare for an expected summit between President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping in November . Blinken and Wang will continue their discussions on Friday . The Israel Hamas conflict has added a fresh dynamic to the testy relationship of the superpowers , and Washington is hoping Beijing can use its influence with Iran to prevent an escalation into a wider war in the Middle East . Wang is expected to meet national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Friday . He is also expected to speak with Biden during his visit to the White House , although it is unclear how substantial their interaction will be . The Biden administration priority with Beijing has been to prevent intense competition between the two largest economies and disagreements on a host of issues including trade , Taiwan and the South China Sea from veering into conflict .

PATH TO BIDEN XI MEETING Policy analysts in China and the say both sides share an interest in averting a wider war in the Middle East and that China , as a major oil purchaser , could exert considerable influence on Iran . Whether it will remains to be seen . \" The Chinese certainly have an interest in preventing a direct confrontation , as they are major oil consumers and that would spike prices , \" said Jon Alterman , head of the Middle East program at Washington Center for Strategic and International Studies . \" Still , the Chinese are unlikely to do any heavy lifting here . I expect they want a seat at the table when the Israel Gaza struggle gets resolved , but they do feel much need or ability to hasten resolution . \" Shi Yinhong , professor of international relations at Renmin University of China , said Beijing exerting its influence over Iran was \" almost the only serious and practical expectation of China on the Middle East situation . \" However Shi added : \" The position on Iran is far from acceptable to China and vice versa . Mutual compromise on this issue could be too limited and small to be of any significance . \" Wang visit to Washington comes after several top officials , including Blinken , visited Beijing in the past several months . Analysts expect Wang talks to focus on preparations for an anticipated meeting between Biden and Xi on the sidelines of the summit of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation APEC countries in San Francisco from 11 to 17 . It would be Biden and Xi first in person meeting since a summit in Bali last November . The two sides go into APEC from different economic perspectives , with economic policy analysts saying the has weathered challenging global conditions after the pandemic somewhat better than China . and Chinese officials held a virtual meeting on Monday on macroeconomic developments . officials said Taiwan and the South and East China Seas , where they accused Beijing of \" destabilizing and dangerous actions \" against rival territorial claimants , would also be on the agenda .

Photograph : Orhan Qereman Reuters The strikes which were conducted on President Joe Biden direction , are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against US personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups that began on October 17 , as per a statement by the US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin . As a result of these attacks , one US citizen contractor died from a cardiac incident while sheltering in place ; 21 US personnel suffered from minor injuries , but all have since returned to duty . The US Defence Secretary said Thursday actions show that President Biden has no higher priority than the safety of US personnel . Austin said the US will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself , its personnel , and its interests . He said : The US does not seek conflict and has no intention nor desire to engage in further hostilities , but these Iranian backed attacks against US forces are unacceptable and must stop . Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces . We will not let them . If attacks by Iran proxies against US forces continue , we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people . Austin said the narrowly tailored strikes in self defence were intended solely to protect and defend US personnel in Iraq and Syria . They are separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas and do not constitute a shift in our approach to the Israel Hamas conflict . We continue to urge all state and non state entities not to take action that would escalate into a broader regional conflict . Earlier , White House National Security Council NSC spokesman John Kirby had said the US would respond to the attacks at a time of our choosing and a manner of our choosing . His comments came after the US Department of Defence said US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 16 times this month by Iranian backed militia groups . According to Al Jazeera , attacks on US forces in the region have spiked since the outbreak of the Israel Hamas war . Biden recently said that he had directly warned Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei against targeting US troops in the Middle East . \" My warning to the Ayatollah was that if they continue to move against those troops , we will respond , and he should be prepared , \" Biden told reporters , adding it has nothing to do with Israel . Washington , DC and Tehran do not have formal diplomatic relations , and Biden did not say how the message was communicated . An aide to Iran President Ebrahim Raisi Mohammad Jamshidi said : \" The US messages were neither directed to the leader of the Islamic Revolution nor were they anything but requests from the Iranian side . \" \" If Biden thinks he has warned Iran , he should ask his team to show him the text of the messages . \" US officials are concerned about the possibility of fighting between Israel and Hamas escalating into a broader regional conflict , as per Al Jazeera .',\n",

In the joint statement , the EU leaders reiterated calls for a humanitarian pause in the war . Meanwhile , the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza released the names of people who were killed in Israeli strikes . This came after US President Joe Biden expressed doubts about the death toll released by the Hamas run health ministry in Gaza .

In the West Bank , over 60 Palestinians were arrested in an overnight Israeli raid and more arrests were reported during a separate Israeli raid in East Jerusalem , Al Jazeera reported .

              " 'First , Hamas Took Hostages . Then , It Took Over Their Social Media . On 7 , friends and relatives of Gali Shlezinger Idan , an Israeli who lives in a kibbutz near the border with Gaza , started getting messages to check her Facebook page . When they did , according to reporting from the New York Times Sheera Frenkel and Talya Minsberg , they found something horrifying : a livestream showing Idan and her family held hostage by Hamas gunmen . There is the sound of gunshots , and mortars . At one point in the 43 minute livestream , Idan tells her children something along the lines of Stay down I ca lose another child today . Idan oldest daughter was killed and her husband was taken hostage . The gunmen eventually left Idan and the two children in the video but not before their loved ones witnessed much of the ordeal on social media . As hard as it is to hear stories like this one , they are also instructive : They tell us about a new way of waging war . For as long as humans have fought each other , they told stories about it now those stories have century tools . On Friday episode of What Next : TBD , I spoke with Frenkel , who covers tech for the Times , about Hamas social media strategy . Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity . Advertisement Lizzie : When you heard about these livestreams , what did you think ? Advertisement Sheera Frenkel : On 7 there had been a number of Israelis who spoke to radio and TV and described seeing livestreams . I immediately kind of was like , Livestreams ? Is that possible ? When I saw it for myself , it shocking Hamas gunmen were able to livestream themselves holding a family hostage for 43 minutes ; in another case , they livestreamed themselves holding a family for over an hour . How did the gunmen get access to the social media accounts ? Advertisement They entered the home ; they asked for their cellphones and their IDs . That was the first thing they asked for . In this case , they took Gali cellphone , unlocked it , opened up Facebook , and began the livestream . Last week , I interviewed members of Hamas that had run social media for the organization in the past . Hamas has a political wing where they develop films and political campaigns for their members . So they actually have a fairly established comms team , and they described it as a very premeditated strategy meant to appeal to their supporters and show what they had done . Hamas has Facebook accounts ; they could have opened up their own Facebook accounts and begun to livestream a video if they wanted to . But the decision to take the cellphone of someone they were holding hostage and use their Facebook account to livestream it was very specific and deliberate . It happened in at least four cases that we could document . Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement How long did it take for the tech companies to realize this was happening and to disable these accounts ? In most cases , the accounts were disabled in 24 to 36 hours . Quite a while , as far the families were concerned . In one case , a young woman was taken hostage from a music festival near the Gaza border , and her Facebook account remained active for three to four days after she was taken . The family continued to get messages on it from people that they presume were holding their daughter hostage . You were a Middle East reporter for 10 years , you lived in Gaza , and you covered previous wars in the region . Have you ever seen anything like this before ? Advertisement No . This is very much a new tactic , and we called up and spoke to people who were experts in extremist groups like Hamas . I remember ISIS pioneering the use of social media to spread their viewpoint across the world . I covered it . I was in Iraq , and I was in Syria , and their ability to use the attention economy of social media to get people to watch really horrible things beheading videos , hostage videos that was , at the time , unprecedented . But they had not thought of this strategy or been able to implement this strategy of hijacking the social media feeds of people you holding hostage . That something I never seen before , and I think it was particularly effective in this case because so many civilians were involved . Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement As you mentioned , you talked to Hamas about their social media strategy , and I really interested in the way they have put thought into using different platforms and how those platforms then spread messages out . Can you walk me through that ? The strategy they come up with is they start on Telegram , which is a messaging app and , I think it fair to say , has almost no content moderation . Hamas has quite a few Telegram channels in Arabic and in English , and in other languages as well , where they just seed videos and photos and slogans and messages . They post a new video or photo , and then they say , Please spread this on Twitter and TikTok . And here translations to other languages . If you French speaking , please post it with this language . If you Spanish speaking , post it It very cohesive and well thought out . Advertisement Largely , they tell people to share on Twitter . They openly commented that Twitter is very easy to post things to right now . We have to remember that when Elon Musk took control of the platform a year ago now , he fired most of the established trust and safety team , many of whom actually had experience in , specifically in Hamas , but also just in extremist organizations . When that expertise left the building , they lost a lot of their skill set in removing these accounts quickly . So Hamas tells them to go to Twitter , and they also tell them to go to TikTok and YouTube , and they even give instructions on how you can speed up the video or slow down the video or clip the video so that if those companies take down one version of it , maybe another version can live online . Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Hamas is supposed to be banned on Facebook , Instagram , TikTok . Has that worked ? Advertisement I think that the Meta owned companies have been very quick to take Hamas accounts down . They struggle with it , though . Hamas also operates schools ; they are a political organization that informs people when power and electricity is going to be on or off . So there are Hamas pages that Facebook has really struggled with . Like , Wait , well , if this is a page that letting people know when the first day of school is or when water and power will be resumed to their neighborhoods , is that something that we should be taking down ? But by and large , when something is posting graphic videos or veers into the territory of posting propaganda that supportive of Hamas military wing , they are very quick to take it down . Twitter less so . I still struggling to figure out TikTok because I seen some videos removed within minutes , I would say , and then others that have lived there for hours , and I ca see rhyme or reason for why some are being removed and some are . I think TikTok is a little bit more whack a mole at the moment . Advertisement Advertisement We come full circle , in a way . I thinking back to those ISIS videos in 2014 , when content moderation was not robust . Things went up on YouTube that were horrifying . But then social media companies seemed to put a decent amount of effort and time and staffing into content moderation that helped stop some of this . At the same time , in 2019 , in Christchurch , New Zealand , a far right extremist killed 51 people in a mosque and livestreamed it on Facebook . What can the social media companies do with this , other than , as you said , play whack a mole ? Play whack a mole , hire ever increasing teams to be responsive and to freeze this kind of activity when it happens . I mentioned that Facebook has been relatively quick to take this stuff down . They also , since COVID , lost people from their security team and their trust and safety team , and so their teams are also smaller than they used to be . Advertisement Advertisement For Twitter , Elon Musk decimated their trust and safety team . So that an extreme example . But all the companies have been reducing their head count and making these teams smaller . And that makes it slower but even if they had more people , that never going to be 100 percent effective . Advertisement Advertisement As you know , it incredibly hard to report from Gaza . Some of the social media that has come out has given people a voice , and yet that can be so easily weaponized to inflict harm . How do companies reckon with that being a tool of information and connection , but also harm and destruction ? It one of the hardest things happening in Gaza right now . There are a lot of people who live in Gaza who depend on social media to try and find out where they going to get water or fuel , or where food is coming in . The provides food to over 1 million people who live in the Gaza Strip , and social media is one way that they tell one another , Oh , the food operation center is happening here today . Especially in a time of war , where there widespread bombing happening across the Gaza Strip , people are letting one another know where it safe to be through social media . Advertisement You have this deep background covering the Middle East and conflict , and also covering tech companies . How do you think the role of technology and social media has evolved in this region in the past decade ? Advertisement In so many ways , what happening in Israel and Gaza and the West Bank is a battle of narratives . It been fought since the , potentially even before , of whose version of the story is the right one . Is it the version that serves the state of Israel ? Is it the version that serves the Palestinian people ? As the years have gone on , as the decades have gone on , each side has become really deeply entrenched in their own narrative of things . Technology , for the most part , has served that . These tech companies , specifically the social media companies , have created really deep echo chambers .

              " 'Before and after images of Gaza Strip as Israeli air raids pummel Palestinian enclave The satellite images released by a US based space technology firm have revealed the devastating impact of Israeli air raids on the Gaza Strip , post the October 7 Hamas attack . The images shared by Maxar Technologies show significant damage to the cities including Izbat Beit Hanoun , Atatra and Al Shati Refugee Camp . These telling images come as Israel continues to bombard Gaza . The Israeli Defence Forces IDF said on Thursday that its fighter jets struck over 250 sites belonging to the Hamas terror in the Gaza Strip over the past day . The sites included Hamas infrastructure , command centres , tunnels and rocket launchers . Before and after images of Gazan city of Beit Hanoun Reuters via Maxar Before and after images of Gazan city of Atatra Reuters via Maxar It added that Hamas had placed rocket launchers in the heart of civilian areas that fired toward Israeli territory throughout the war . The IDF Navy forces also struck a Hamas surface to air missile launch position in Khan Younis . The missile launch site is \" located adjacent to a mosque and kindergarten , which is further proof that Hamas deliberately uses civilian sites for terror purposes , \" said the IDF statement . According to the Health Ministry in Hamas ruled Gaza , over 750 people were killed over Wednesday , higher than the 704 killed the previous day . Ground raids The IDF said it launched a brief ground raid into northern Gaza overnight into Thursday . The infantry forces and tanks ventured into the northern part of the strip . The raid led by the Givati infantry brigade was reportedly part of preparing the border area for the ground war . \" Troops struck numerous terrorists , infrastructure , and anti tank guided missile launch positions , and operated to prepare the battlefield , \" the IDF was quoted by The Times of Israel . The forces struck several militant targets to \" prepare the battlefield \" and the soldiers returned to Israeli territory after the raid . The Gaza Health Ministry says more than Palestinians have been killed in the war . That figure includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week . The fighting has killed more than people in Israel , mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack , according to the Israeli government . Hamas also holds some 222 hostages in Gaza .',\n",
              " 'Arab nations condemn Israel Gaza assault during UN debate Arab nations have linked hands with the Global South to challenge Israel and its western backers to end the bombing in a Gaza at the start of a rare two day emergency debate at the UN general assembly . In a fierce warning on Thursday the Iranian foreign minister said that if what he described as the genocide did not stop the US would not be spared from this fire . The debate was occasionally unsettling for the US , as diplomats from across the globe challenged what they frequently described as Washington unqualified support for Israel since the Hamas attack that killed people . Since then , according to the Palestinian authorities , more than people have been killed in Gaza , with Israel pounding the territory with airstrikes . The tone of the debate was set by its title Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory . A large majority of nations in the assembly will probably condemn Israel if a non binding vote is called on Friday . The smaller 15 strong UN security council , including its five permanent veto wielding members , has been unable to reach agreement on the terms of a humanitarian pause to the hostilities . On Wednesday Russia and the US vetoed each other resolutions . The US last week also vetoed a Brazilian resolution calling for humanitarian corridors into Gaza , on the grounds that it did not assert Israel right to self defence . A resolution passed by the security council carries more weight than one passed by the larger 193 country general assembly . In a stark warning , Iran foreign minister , Hossein Amir Abdollahian , said : I say frankly to the American statesmen who are managing the genocide in Palestine that we do not welcome an expansion of the war in the region . But if the genocide in Gaza continues they will not be spared from this fire . He insisted progress was being made to secure the release of hostages seized by Hamas . The Palestinian ambassador to the UN , Riyad Mansour , said that at least 80 Palestinian families had lost 10 or more of their relatives , and sometimes up to 45 members of the same families had been killed . How can representatives of states explain how horrible it is that Israelis were killed , and not feel the same outrage when Palestinians are now killed every single day ? Mansour asked . Ayman Hussein Abdullah Al Safadi , Jordan foreign minister , lambasted the language used by Israel saying the Israeli government called for wiping out Palestinians of the face of this Earth , called them animals unworthy of life . The Israeli ambassador to the UN , Gilad Erdan , showed the general assembly a brief video that he said showed a Hamas fighter trying to decapitate a man with a garden tool during the attack on 7 October this year . Erdan , who has called for the resignation of the UN secretary general , António Guterres , insisted : This is not a war with the Palestinians . Israel is at war with the genocidal Hamas terrorist organisation Hamas do not care about the Palestinian people . Hamas has only one goal to annihilate Israel . In a joint statement the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates , Jordan , Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , Oman , Qatar , Kuwait , Egypt and Morocco , on Thursday condemned the targeting of civilians and violations of international law in Gaza . Their statement said the right to self defence did not justify breaking the law and neglecting Palestinians rights . The Arab ministers also condemned forced displacement and collective punishment of the Palestinians in Gaza . They criticised Israel continued occupation of Palestinian areas and called for more efforts to implement a two state solution to the decades long conflict , an idea that has been the foundation of a long moribund peace process . The absence of a political solution to the Palestinian Israeli conflict has led to repeated acts of violence and suffering for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and the peoples of the region , it said . Support for Israel came from European governments . The German chancellor , Olaf Scholz , said EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Friday would send a clear signal of backing for Israel in what he called its self defence efforts . Qatar also said its work trying to negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas was being hampered by the continued Israeli bombardment . The Qatari foreign affairs minister , Mohammed Al Khulaifi , said : It a very , very , difficult negotiation with the bombing continuing every day , our task becomes more difficult . But despite that we remain hopeful , we remain committed . Anger was also expressed at a new pitch by the Turkish president , Recep Tayyip Erdoğan . He said the Israeli attack on Gaza has reached the level of a massacre , and the silence of the international community on what is happening is a shame for humanity . Erdoğan added that peace would only be possible with the creation of an independent , sovereign and geographically integrated , Palestinian state , according to the 1967 borders , with East Jerusalem as its capital .',\n",

From the article : Unionists feel an affinity with Israel . Sir Ronald Storrs , governor of the so called Palestine Mandate 1917 26 , welcomed the arrival of Jewish colonists into the region after the Balfour declaration advocating a Jewish homeland . Arabs opposed the British mandate ; they expected independence . Indeed , the British had led them to believe they would get it after the Turkish defeat . So Storrs hoped the more Jewish colonists the better because they would form for England a little loyal Jewish Ulster in a sea of potentially hostile Arabism . That went well , did it ? The Arabs , in whose lands the British encouraged Jews to live , never accepted the legitimacy of the British creation or its later emanation , Israel , following little loyal Jewish Ulster revolt against British rule . They never will . School atlases in most Arab countries do show Israel . The British created a mess and then cleared off . It what they do : India , Pakistan , Cyprus etc , etc .

Tightly packed streets in Beit Hanoun look obliterated , with a rare white structure standing out in the gray wasteland . Israel says its war against Hamas is aimed at destroying the Iran backed terror group infrastructure and has vowed to dismantle the organization after the October 7 massacres , while minimizing harm to Gaza civilians . The IDF has been calling on Palestinians to evacuate from northern Gaza southward , as it intensifies strikes in the Gaza City area . Before and after satellite imagery shows total destruction of entire neighborhoods in Gaza due to the nonstop Israeli bombardment . The Cradle October 26 , 2023 Led by Hamas and carried out with other terror groups , the assault saw some terrorists burst across the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip by land , air and sea , killing some people and seizing at least 228 hostages of all ages , under the cover of thousands of rockets fired at Israeli towns and cities . In a primetime televised address Thursday evening , Gallant , the defense minister , promised to make every effort to return the hostages held by Hamas , and said : We are in decisive moments . This is a war for our home and we will win it . It either us or them . Israel campaign against Hamas in Gaza is being carried out by air , land and sea . It is hitting bunkers , tunnels , communications , terrorists and their commanders , he continued . The war is precise , lethal and powerful . It is our duty to win this war . That the unwritten contract between the security establishment and the citizens . It is my duty as the defense minister to lead so that we win the battle , and the citizens can live here in peace and quiet . Advertisement Gallant said again that the planned ground offensive will occur soon . Additional stages in the war will also come , we are creating the conditions for them and we will carry them out . I am determined to ensure the State of Israel is victorious over this tough and evil enemy over this epitome of evil . Nothing like this has happened in Israel 75 years of existence , he continued , referring to the scale of the carnage and destruction , and the number of abducted Israelis . What will happen in the next 75 years depends largely on the achievements in this battle . Israeli Air Force sources says that more than sites belonging to Hamas and other terror groups have been struck since the beginning of the war . Gaza Hamas run health ministry says the strikes have killed over people , many of them children . The figures issued by the terror group can not be independently verified , and are believed to include its own terrorists and gunmen killed in Israel and in Gaza , and the victims of what Israel says are hundreds of errant Palestinian rockets that have landed in the Strip since the war began . Israel says it killed Hamas terrorists inside Israel on and after October 7 . The death toll on both sides is expected to rise significantly once Israel launches its ground offensive and begins entering cities . Troops are expected to have to contend with Gaza network of tunnels dug by terror groups , booby traps and bombs , as they battle through tough urban environments . The IDF deployed a limited ground incursion into Gaza in the early morning hours of Thursday , sending infantry forces and tanks up to a kilometer into the northern part of the Strip in a targeted raid ahead of the planned full scale offensive . Advertisement According to the IDF , the raid led by the Givati infantry brigade and the Armored Division was part of preparing the border area for the next stages of the war . Troops struck numerous terrorists , infrastructure and anti tank guided missile launch positions , and operated to prepare the battlefield , the army said . Soldiers returned to Israeli territory after the hours long raid , the IDF added . IDF Spokesman Rear Daniel Hagari said Thursday evening that the army would continue similar limited ground raids in Gaza , saying they would be carried out tonight as well , and it will continue all the more forcefully in the coming days . He said the IDF was still carrying out massive strikes on the Gaza Strip , from the air and sea , focusing on killing senior Hamas members and those who participated in the October 7 assault . Thursday saw multiple salvos of rockets aimed at central Israel , including the cities of Tel Aviv , Rishon Lezion , Bat Yam , Givatayim , Ramat Gan , Holon and others , as well as barrages targeting southern cities Ashdod , Ashkelon and Netivot , as well as largely evacuated Gaza border communities . פגיעה בבניין בפתח תקווה בז news October 26 , 2023 Many of the projectiles were intercepted or fell in uninhabited areas , but one damaged a building in the central city of Petah Tikva and started a fire in an eighth floor apartment , prompting all 36 families living in the building to temporarily evacuate as officials removed the rocket , which was suspected to have not fully exploded . A woman living in the damaged apartment had headed out with her daughter minutes before the impact . A rocket in a later barrage at central Israel landed near a highway near Rehovot , setting fire to a utility pole . There were subsequently reports of widespread power outages in the area , but medics said no one was physically injured . Gazan terrorists have launched thousands of rockets at Israel since October 7 , killing and wounding a number of people . Footage shows a rocket impacting near a highway in central Israel , setting fire to a utility pole . Emanuel Mannie Fabian October 26 , 2023 European Union leaders called Thursday for humanitarian corridors and pauses to get aid into Gaza as the United Nations warned nowhere in the territory is safe from Israel retaliation for bloody Hamas attacks . The joint statement from EU leaders came after hours of negotiations at a summit in Brussels . The 27 nation bloc has long been split between more pro Palestinian members such as Ireland and Spain , and staunch backers of Israel including Germany and Austria . The European Council expresses its gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza , the statement said . It calls for continued , rapid , safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs , the statement added . The call for a humanitarian pause was first recommended by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday and roughly a dozen House Democrats joined that call on Thursday . IDF Chief of Staff Lt . Herzi Halevi said Tuesday that the full ground offensive into Gaza had been delayed by tactical and even strategic considerations . On Wednesday , The New York Times reported that Israel had agreed to a request from the United States to temporarily delay the planned Gaza ground incursion to give Washington more time to deploy additional air defense systems to protect its troops in the region . The US was also reportedly concerned that Israel lacks achievable military goals for its operations in Gaza , leading to fears that the IDF is not yet ready for a ground incursion . The campaign is also understood to have been postponed to allow for extensive internationally brokered negotiations with Hamas over the potential release of hundreds of Israeli and foreign hostages it is holding . Talks have resulted in four captives being freed mother and daughter Judith and Natalie on Friday night , and elderly women Yocheved Lifshitz and Nurit Cooper on Monday night . The negotiations have also resulted in a trickle of humanitarian aid entering Gaza for its besieged and devastated civilian population . Twelve aid trucks entered Gaza on Thursday , bringing food , water and medicine , according to Rafah border crossing officials and the Palestine Red Crescent Society , bringing the total number of trucks to have entered the Strip in recent days to 74 . Hebrew media reports on Thursday evening suggested that Israel was considering allowing fuel to enter Gaza via Egypt as part of a deal that would see Hamas free many captives . But Hagari , the IDF spokesman , said that at this point , the instruction of the political echelon is that no fuel is entering . If there is a change , we will update the public . Hagari added that a great deal of Hamas ability to operate relies on fuel , repeating the claim that the terror group is stealing and stockpiling fuel that could go to hospitals . Hamas made an unverified claim Thursday that almost 50 Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip had been killed by Israeli airstrikes . There was no independent verification , and Israel has not reacted to such claims in the past . The terror group frequently fabricates such statements and is engaged in psychological warfare against the families of the hostages as well as the general population . Izz ad Din Al Qassam Brigades estimates that the number of Zionist prisoners who were killed in the Gaza Strip as a result of Zionist strikes and massacres has reached almost 50 , the terror group said in a statement on its Telegram channel . An IDF official said separately on Thursday that a portion of the weapons used by Hamas in its October 7 onslaught were manufactured in Iran or North Korea . The military official made the statement during an official media tour in which it displayed a variety of weapons recovered from communities in southern Israel attacked by the terrorists . A range of landmines , rocket propelled grenades RPGs , and homemade drones were part of the haul displayed . Part of the arsenal included Iranian made mortar rounds and North Korean RPGs . I think about five to 10 percent of the weapons here were made in Iran , and 10 percent are North Korean . The rest of it was made inside the Gaza Strip , the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity . I think the most surprising thing was the amount of weapons that they brought inside Israel , the official said . Times of Israel staff and agencies contributed to this report .',\n",

              " 'Nawaz Sharif in Pakistan : A fragile economy , an interfering army and politics of turmoil await the former PM Nawaz Sharif is back and full of fire even at 73 . His first speech at the Minar e Pakistan in Lahore was quite astonishing in some respects even as he quietly avoided the issues he had been fulminating about in London . It seems a bargain has been made with multiple actors , not just the army . All of this is interesting not because a politician has come back to his country , but because Pakistan itself has changed almost beyond all recognition in terms of the drivers that are propelling it . First , the fact that Sharif was able to return on the say so of the army is obvious to all . The army led National Accountability Bureau did not oppose the Islamabad High Court decision to provide protective bail for Sharif on two of the most critical cases : one involving the acquisition of no less than four flats in London , for which the family was unable to account and another concerning the source of funds to set up Al Azizia Steel Mills and Hill Metal Establishment HME in Saudi Arabia . A third arrest warrant was also suspended in the Toshakhana case where Imran was caught on shaky ground . The point is that there is a clutch of other cases , including one on a sugar mill , all of which means that the former premier is shackled by the leg with no certainty that he will even be allowed to compete . That is point one . Second , look at the massive crowds that greeted him . That should at all events prove that the party apparatus is alive and well on the ground . And that the grand old party has its funds intact . This is South Asia . Do run away with the idea that he is a popular phenomenon that will translate automatically into votes . The last Gallup poll shows him trailing at 35 per cent , way behind Imran Khan at 60 per cent . But the latter has pulled down the army more than any leader alive or dead ; and that section of the population , which is the educated middle class and the youth , are unlikely to drift to Sharif for a decisive win . That means he going to need a coalition partner . Look who a rung above him in the popularity polls . Saad Rizvi , a figure of the religious right who gained prominence on the blasphemy issue and serves as the political representative of the Barelvi community among the masses . Abdul Basit analyses his rise due to repeated surrenders by the parties in power , his ability to broaden his base to include inflation and food shortages and his involvement in relief activities for which he seems to have no lack of money and crucially , in mobilising the Barelvi vote due to the frequent terrorist attacks against it . In recent days , TLP Tehreek e Labbaik Pakistan has drawn massive crowds in pro Palestine protests , further enhancing its popularity . It may be recalled that Sharif has teamed up with the religious right before , but TLP has been used by the army against Nawaz in the past , with a video showing a senior military official distributing money to the protesters going viral . True , politicians often form alliances with unlikely partners , but any collaboration with a radical group would further limit his room for manoeuvre , a situation that would be completely favourable for the army . That point two . Then there the content of his speech . Not a word against the army , which is unsurprising . Even a toddler would know that hybrid is out of the window , and the army is in the chair , and there it will stay . Therefore , only oblique references to why he was removed from power including the very real fact that the only proven charge against him was on accepting undeclared pay from his son firm and a clear statement that he has not come for revenge . There was pathos in his cry that he was not allowed to visit his dying wife . The most surprising thing was the call to repair relations with India noting without exaggeration , that even Bangladesh , once part of Pakistan , was far ahead in economic terms . The obvious fact is that Pakistan can not in truth , remain in a state of confrontation with India , and expect to get investments , not even from brotherly countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE both of whom have already invested to an extent in the country in recent months . But the Saudis have promised some 25 billion in investments . Not surprising therefore that Sharif went first to Saudi Arabia and UAE before arriving in Pakistan . Prince Mohammad Bin Sultan for one , is a shrewd businessman looking to diversify away from fossil fuels . Wars , and such like have no place in his scheme of things , or that of the others in the Muslim world , or even China . The message overall to Pakistan seems to be to get its act together , or else . The trouble is that this is a terrible time to be prime minister . With a sinking economy around trillion in debt servicing in , which is more than 50 per cent of the budget there are few choices ahead . Gas prices are due to go up 193 per cent , which will very likely create popular unrest . Combine this with a 58 million plus youth bulge about 13 per cent of the total population that has been fed with tales of a corrupt politician and the benign army . It is no accident that 88 per cent of those polled , approve of the army . All of that makes for a terrible combination for Nawaz , especially since he is likely to continue to be in the back seat for a while , with brother Shahbaz playing proxy , and balancing unlikely allies , and with a dozen cases hanging fire , there is only trouble ahead . Here the key aspect though . The only thing he can deliver , and quickly , with little cost , is to open up trade with India . That will bring down inflation and potentially , provide a huge source of income in cross border trade across Afghanistan , Central Asia and beyond . That is what will ultimately sell , not Sharif personal tragedies . As inflation is likely to spiral even further , no one is going to even remember . Therefore the lesson is this . Every disaster carries an opportunity . And ironically Pakistan near collapse could be the driver for a revolutionary turnaround , not just in the economy , but in how Pakistan positions itself in the world . That might well be Sharif lasting legacy for his country , provided the khakis see sense . Already the army chief is making plans for a cutting edge air force even while overseeing Exercise Indus Shield that incorporates 14 nations including China , Turkey , Saudi Arabia and UAE . So no , there no evidence of that yet . Which is what will make India pause . First the evidence , then the direction .

              " 'Mysterious Underground City Beneath Gaza : Bunkers , Storage And Baited Trap Mysterious Underground City Beneath Gaza : Bunkers , Storage And Baited Trap There is no verification of the comment by Sinwar , who may be seeking shelter underground ahead of the Israeli ground offensive . But the estimate of hundreds of kilometres is widely accepted by security analysts , even though the blockaded coastal strip is only 40 km long . Updated Oct 27 , 2023 PM IST Underground tunnel outside the Gaza Strip . Reuters Israeli ground troops may face a secret tunnel network that is many kilometers long at least 80 metres deep as described by a security source . A freed hostage also called it a spider web . These tunnels could potentially be the biggest threat to the Israeli Defense Forces IDF . Experts believe that over 200 Israeli hostages in could be in these tunnels . Even though Israel has invested heavily in tunnel detection , including a sensor equipped underground barrier it called an \" iron wall \" ; Hamas is still thought to have working tunnels that are yet not discovered . After the hostilities in 2021 , Hamas leader in Gaza , Yehya Al Sinwar , said , \" They started saying they destroyed 100 kms of Hamas tunnels . I am telling you , the tunnels we have in the Gaza Strip exceed 500 kms . Even if their narrative is true , they only destroyed 20 of the tunnels . \" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin noted that Iraq nine month long battle to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State might prove to have been easier than what awaits the Israelis likely to be \" a lot of IEDs improvised explosive devices , a lot of booby traps , and just a really grinding activity \" . Hostage Shares There is no verification of the comment by Sinwar , who may be seeking shelter underground ahead of the Israeli ground offensive . But the estimate of hundreds of kilometres is widely accepted by security analysts , even though the blockaded coastal strip is only 40 km long . With Israel in full control of Gaza air and sea access and 59 km of its 72 km land borders , and with Egypt 13 km to the south , the tunnels provide one of the few ways for Hamas to bring in weapons , equipment and people . A recently released Israeli hostage , 85 year old Yocheved Lifshitz , said , \" It looked like a spider web , many , many tunnels . The hostage also added that they walked many kilometres under the ground . Hamas believes that with Israel overpowering aerial and armoured military superiority , tunnels are a way to cut some of those advantages by forcing Israel soldiers to move underground in cramped spaces that the Hamas fighters know well . An Israeli military spokesperson said on Thursday , \" I wo elaborate on the number of kilometres of tunnels but it is a high number , built under schools and residential areas . \" Urging the United Nations Security Council to intervene , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called for an immediate cessation of \" aggression \" on Gaza and moves toward \" a political solution instead of military and security solutions \" . The Underground City Israeli security sources say Israel heavy aerial bombardments have caused little damage to the tunnel infrastructure with Hamas naval commandos able to launch a seaborne attack targeting coastal communities near Gaza this week . \" Although we have been attacking massively for days and days , the Hamas leadership is pretty much intact , as is the ability to command and control , the ability even to try and launch counter attacks , \" said Amir Avivi , a former brigadier general of the Israeli military . He added that \" There is a whole city all over Gaza underneath with depths of 40 50 metres . There are bunkers and headquarters and storage and of course they are connected to more than a thousand rocket launching positions . \" Other sources estimated depths of up to 80 metres . Previously Planned Hamas was created in Gaza in 1987 and is assumed to have begun digging tunnels in the , when Israel granted Yasser Arafat Palestine Liberation Organization some degree of authority in Gaza . The tunnel network is a key reason why Hamas is stronger in Gaza than in the Israeli occupied West Bank , where Israel settlements , military bases and monitoring devices make it harder to get anything in from Jordan . Tunneling became easier in 2005 when Israel pulled its soldiers and settlers out of Gaza , and Hamas also won power in a 2006 election . Although the military tunnels went unnoticed during that era , Gaza smugglers would show off their scarcely concealed commercial tunnels under the Rafah border . These were around three feet wide and used to haul goods along the sandy tunnel floors in hollowed out petrol barrels . In 2007 , Hamas is thought to have brought its commander Mohammed Deif into Gaza through a tunnel from Egypt . Deif was the mastermind behind Hamas deadly 7 attack into Israel , which killed people and took hostages .',\n",

Israeli officials and their supporters have privately voiced concern to Reuters that as more time passes since the 7 atrocities committed by Hamas , the more the world focus will be on death and destruction from the Israeli assault in Gaza . Advertisement Biden aides are urging their Israeli counterparts to take more time to carefully think through their exit strategy before a full scale ground invasion , one source said . officials have cautioned that crafting fine points of such a strategy \" on the fly , \" as was often the case for the in the early stages of the Iraq war , would be a mistake , the source added . military advisers sent to the region are urging Israeli counterparts to be cautious because any invading force will face difficult fighting terrain and a warren of tunnels and booby trapped buildings that could increase casualties among Israeli soldiers and Gaza civilians , a separate source familiar with the conversations said . In rare comments on an active foreign policy crisis Obama , Biden Democratic predecessor and former boss , warned this week that Israel cutting off food and water to Gaza could \" harden Palestinian attitudes for generations . \" The White House did not respond when asked if the administration coordinated with Biden Democratic predecessor . ARAB LEADERS PRESSURE When Hamas operatives burst out of Gaza and attacked southern Israel on 7 , Biden offered full throated support for Israel , saying he relayed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that \" Israel has the right to defend itself and its people . Full stop . \" He did not mention the Palestinian people . Addressing reporters before departing for the Middle East on 11 , Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the top objective of his trip was a robust show of solidarity with Israel , including providing all the military equipment that it needs to defend itself . \" The United States has Israel back , \" Blinken said . He did mention humanitarian aid at all . During Blinken six day trip , the death number in Gaza soared from Israeli air strikes and concerns grew about food and water . Every Arab leader Blinken met in the region pressed him to urgently find a solution to the rapidly deteriorating situation in Gaza . Blinken relayed the concerns of Arab leaders , while others spoke to the president directly . The intense protests against Israel that followed last week blast at a Palestinian hospital , which the United States and Israel both blamed on Palestinian operatives , also alarmed officials . The protests were reminders of the risks of escalation during any ground assault , officials said , because they show how Israel adversaries could seek to wield disinformation to spark unrest . HUMANITARIAN PAUSE The most rapid shift in policy has happened this week , to support a cessation in Israel attacks on Gaza to allow aid in and people to escape . Asked on 23 about international demands for a humanitarian pause , White House security spokesman John Kirby said the United States wants to make sure \" Israel has the tools it needs to defend itself and to go after Hamas and that humanitarian assistance keeps flowing . \" A day later , Kirby and Blinken advocated for one publicly . The shift followed a plea from Secretary General Antonio Guterres for civilians to be protected and increasingly desperate appeals from organizations to allow in aid . The revised its own resolution from a focus on Israel right to defend itself to include calls for all measures , specifically to include humanitarian pauses , to allow unhindered humanitarian access of aid . Remarks made by Biden on Wednesday are in contrast with those on 7 , and show a new direction . \" Israel has to do everything in its power , as difficult as it is , to protect innocent civilians , \" Biden told a press conference . He offered a rare criticism as well of Israel \" extremist settlers \" on the West Bank , accusing them of pouring gasoline on a fire , and called for a concentrated effort , once the crisis is over , to work toward an accord under which Israel and a new Palestinian state would exist side by side in peace . But Biden also expressed skepticism toward Palestinian estimates of the death number and a continued staunch support of Israel . He told the press conference that he had \" no confidence \" in the numbers the Palestinians were using about Gaza dead .

              " 'Macron proposes that anti Islamic State coalition fight Hamas October 25 , 2023 am Updated am IST JERUSALEM French President Emmanuel Macron proposed on October 24 that an international coalition fighting against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria be widened to include the fight against the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza . Macron gave no detail on how the coalition of dozens of countries , of which Israel is not a member , could be involved . Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem , Macron stressed that France and Israel shared terrorism as their \" common enemy \" . \" France is ready for the international coalition against Daesh in which we are taking part for operations in Iraq and Syria to also fight against Hamas , \" he told reporters , referring to Islamic State . Macron , who warned against the risks of a regional conflict , also said the fight against Hamas \" must be without mercy but not without rules \" . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not directly comment on Macron proposal but said the fight was a battle between the \" axis of evil \" and \" the free world \" . \" This battle is not merely our own it everybody battle , \" he said . The led coalition fighting Islamic State was formed in September 2014 . Macron office said the idea was to draw inspiration from the coalition and that France was available to discuss with Israel and partners what could be relevant against Hamas . \" The international coalition against Daesh does not limit itself to operations on the ground , but is also involved in the training of Iraqi forces , the sharing of information between partners , and the fight against terrorism funding , \" it said . Thirty French citizens were killed by Hamas militants in their attack on southern Israel on 7 , in which more than 200 people were seized and people killed . The Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli air strikes on Gaza have killed over people since then . The French President , who met families of French victims at Tel Aviv airport , said freeing nine French hostages was a priority for France . He was due to meet regional leaders in Jordan capital Amman on Tuesday . Mahmoud Abbas office said Macron would also meet the Palestinian leader in Ramallah , in the West Bank . Macron visit comes after EU Foreign Ministers on Monday struggled to agree on a call for a \" humanitarian pause \" in the war .',\n",
              " 'Amnesty International Finds Damning Evidence of War Crimes by Israel in Gaza ; Death Toll Tops This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form . AMY GOODMAN : The death toll in Gaza has topped as Israel continues to bombard the besieged territory for a day . According to Palestinian health authorities , the dead include children . Israel , with the backing of the United States , has rejected calls for a ceasefire . On Tuesday , Secretary General António Guterres addressed the Security Council and called for a ceasefire . SECRETARY GENERAL ANTÓNIO GUTERRES : It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum . The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation . They have seen their lands steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence , their economy stifled , their people displaced and their homes demolished . Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing . But the grievances of the Palestinian people can not justify the appalling attacks by Hamas , and those appalling attacks can not justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people . AMY GOODMAN : Israel condemned Guterres comments and has vowed to stop issuing visas to representatives . Israel ambassador to the is also calling for Guterres resignation . This all comes as the humanitarian situation in Gaza grows worse by the hour , as dwindling fuel supplies could soon force the closure of all hospitals in the territory . Israel is also continuing to carry out attacks on the occupied West Bank . An Israeli drone strike on the Jenin refugee camp has killed at least three Palestinians . Israeli security forces and settlers have killed at least a hundred Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since October . And even before that , this was the deadliest year for Palestinians , at least one killed a day in the West Bank . Meanwhile , the number of Palestinians jailed by Israel has doubled over the past two weeks , from about to . In other developments , the prime minister of Qatar says he hopes there will be a breakthrough soon on the Israeli hostages being held by Gaza . Hamas and other groups are believed to be holding about 220 people seized on October in the Hamas attack that left around people dead in Israel . We begin today show in Ramallah , in the occupied West Bank , where we joined by Budour Hassan , Amnesty International researcher on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories . Amnesty International published a report last week headlined Damning evidence of war crimes as Israeli attacks wipe out entire families in Gaza . Budour , welcome back to Democracy Now ! Can you lay out your findings ? BUDOUR HASSAN : A hello , Amy , to you , to Juan and to all listeners and viewers . With the help of our field worker who is based in Gaza and testimonies that we gathered from witnesses , victims and relatives , in addition to open source evidence and photographs examined by our evidence lab team , we found out that Israeli forces carried out indiscriminate attacks , killing and injuring civilians , and in some cases that we documented , and that barely scratch the surface of the horror that is unfolding in Gaza , entire families were wiped out during this bombing campaign , which is only escalating . In addition to indiscriminate attacks by Israeli forces , we also documented the ongoing use of collective punishment , which is a war crime , that even where Israel alleged that there was a military target , a legitimate military target , the attacks failed to abide by the principle of proportionality . And just , Amy , to go further , because we keep hearing numbers , and sometimes we may be desensitized and even inured to the extent of horror that we are witnessing , that behind each of these number there are stories . So , as part of our work , Amnesty International researchers have been listening to testimonies of people in Gaza , of victims , talking directly to people over the phone . And when we talk to people for example , we talked to Tahir al Zaizi phon . , who lost 26 members of his family . All of his family were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Deir el Balah . Tahir al Zaizi two children , aged 8 and 6 , were among those killed his mother , his father , his brothers , his nieces , everyone of his family . And when we talked to him , he simply said , You know , in my heart , there is no room for all of this . And he started reciting the names , ages of his relatives lost . And I was reminded by Scholastique Mukasonga , the Rwandan writer , when she was remembering her loved ones who were killed in the Rwandan genocide and said that They are all killed . No one has remained . And this is exactly what happened to Tahir . Another father we talked to , when we talked to him over the phone , he was removing rubble with his own hands , because bulldozers could make it to the neighborhood . And there are no bulldozers ca even make it because there is no fuel to power bulldozers and to remove the rubble . So he was left with trying to remove the rubble and to excavate the shreds of his daughter . And then , while we were with him on the phone , someone told him , We found the toe of your little daughter . And he started kissing her toe . This is the only thing that was left to him from her . We talked to people who do even have photographs to remember their loved ones with . They only have rubble , because their phones , their laptops were all destroyed in airstrikes . We also talked to relatives of the family of al Dos in al Zeitoun neighborhood in Gaza City . Fifteen members of this family were killed in an Israeli airstrike on the first day of the bombings on the of October , including a 12 year old named Awni al Dos . We did not realize at the time that Awni was a talented gamer and YouTuber . Only later did it emerge from his friends that one of his dreams was to have more than subscribers on YouTube , which he will never see . And these are just some of the faces . Right now , as we speak , people in Gaza have not been able to mourn or to grieve properly . There are no funerals for the dead . It very hard . There are more than bodies buried under the rubble , and people can not get . Even when people manage to bury their loved ones , they just bury remnants . And even when they share with us testimonies , with the difficulty of getting to people , what they share with us almost are fragments of testimonies , not really testimonies , because of the devastation that they living through and because simply they say , We need time to at least think about mourning our loved ones , about reflecting on all that we been going through . And with this incessant bombings and war , they do even have time for that . JUAN GONZÁLEZ : Budour , I wanted to ask you : What did your report find about the Israeli military warning civilians before dropping these bombs or missile attacks ? And also , Israel has claimed that the people of Gaza should move out of northern Gaza into the south . But what are you finding about attacks in the south ? AMY GOODMAN : Budour ? We talking to Budour Hassan , who is Amnesty International researcher on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories . We having a bit of a sound issue . Amnesty International has published a new report headlined Damning evidence of war crimes as Israeli attacks wipe out entire families in Gaza . Go ahead with what you were saying , Budour . Why do we turn to a clip as we fix the sound with Budour Hassan ? More than half of Gaza population has been displaced by the Israeli assault . This is an 18 year old Palestinian named Dima Allamdani . She had fled to southern Gaza after Israel ordered Palestinians to leave their homes in the north . Much of her family died in an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis , where the family had sought temporary shelter . DIMA ALLAMDANI : translated I went to look for my mother , my father and my siblings at the morgue . At first they told me , Come , see your mother . They did show me her face , but I recognized her from what she has on her feet . God bless her soul . I felt heartbroken . It was like a nightmare . They opened my father coffin , and he had no signs of injuries , but he died . God bless his soul . I had a 16 year old sister among the dead , and they wrote my name on her coffin since they thought it was me . Her body did have any signs of injuries , but maybe she died from internal injuries . They also showed me my little sister . She in first grade . And they asked me , Who is she ? At first I did recognize her due to all the cuts and burns on her face . Then they wrote her name on her coffin . I would have never thought that my family would end up like this . I felt heartbroken . It a nightmare . I ca believe it , until now , that they all dead , no one left . JUAN GONZÁLEZ : I think we have the connection straightened out with Budour Hassan . I was asking you , Budour , about the Israeli warnings to civilians before attacks , what you learned about that , and also about the Israeli claim that the Palestinians of northern Gaza should move to the south for safety . BUDOUR HASSAN : Juan , in the majority of cases that we did document , there were no warnings before the airstrikes , so the families did not receive at all any warnings . Even in cases where there was advance warning , that advance warning was not effective , because it was only informed to one of the family members , not to the entire family or the residents of the buildings . And it failed to meet the standards that require to make a warning effective , with no clear timeframe . With regards to the warning , the initial warning by the Israeli army issued on the of October for all of the residents of north of Wadi Gaza to evacuate to south of Wadi Gaza , this amounts to a forced displacement , simply because this is unfeasible for this community to leave . They can not leave . Obviously , there are thousands of people with disabilities , wounded people . This number of people simply do not have the means and can not leave . And then that was later followed by leaflets dropped by the Israeli army warning people to leave and then saying that anyone who chooses to stay north of Wadi Gaza will be considered accomplice with armed terrorist organizations , as per the words of the army , which again amounts to collective punishment , fails to meet the principle of distinction , because an entire area , hundreds of thousands , nearly a million people are treated just like an open fire zone , which also signals that the Israeli army intends to not distinguish between civilians and military target , because an entire area is transformed into one . And even if we support that many of these people were to leave , the situation in southern Gaza , and especially in Rafah and Khan Younis , is particularly dire . The UNRWA run schools are barely they not capable of dealing with the amount of people , the influx of people into south Gaza , in addition to the incessant bombardment also targeting areas in southern Gaza , especially over the last five days . So , these coercive conditions in which the Israeli army is trying to force people out , which , again , amount to forced displacement , knowing that people in Gaza absolutely have nowhere safe from bombardment and airstrikes . AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you about the West Bank . That where you are right now , Budour . You in Ramallah . In the occupied West Bank , health officials say at least a hundred Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces and armed settlers amidst mounting military raids and arrests . The Israeli human rights group has documented some of the attacks . In one video shared online , an Israeli settler , accompanied by an Israeli soldier , shoots a man at point blank range . Major protests also across the West Bank have taken aim at the ruling Palestinian Authority , which has launched a violent crackdown on demonstrations . Last week , a 12 year old Palestinian girl named Razan Nasrallah was shot and killed by PA security forces during protests in Jenin following the deadly bombing of Gaza Al Ahli Hospital . Still not clear what that explosion who was responsible for that explosion . But , Budour , if you can talk about what happening also with Gazans who had work permits in the occupied West Bank , what has happened to them , and what happening in the prisons , where thousands of Palestinians are held ? BUDOUR HASSAN : Since the of October , after the Hamas attack , thousands of workers from Gaza who had valid work permits to work in Israel and the occupied West Bank had their work permits unilaterally revoked . So , they could only learn about that through an application . And then Israeli forces started rounding them up and detaining them in military bases in cage like conditions . One prisoner who was later released , because he was actually a resident of the West Bank , spoke about torture and other ill treatment to which these workers are subjected . Families of workers who contacted Israeli human rights organizations , including HaMoked , Gisha and Physicians for Human Rights , said that they have no clue where their family members are . So , Israel now is treating is arbitrarily detaining thousands of Palestinian workers , almost treating them like hostages , denying them due process , denying them meetings with lawyers . There is not even a hint of due process , in addition to torture . All that in the context of increasing numbers of detentions , and before that , before all of this started , the number of Palestinians administratively detained without charges or trial has hit a 20 year high . And the number has doubled just since the of October . And Palestinian families obviously have not been able to visit their loved ones in prison . In addition to that , the Israeli parliament , the Knesset , adopted an amendment that would authorize the Israeli prison authorities to not limit the number of people who can be detained in one cell , which has made the conditions of imprisonment absolutely dire and amounting to torture and other ill treatment . All of that , Amy , as you said , in the context of increasing number of unlawful killings of Palestinians , including Palestinian children , mostly during protests , and many of these cases where state supported settlers have also been rampaging across the West Bank , leading to unprecedented levels of forcible transfer in areas around Ramallah . And unfortunately , this level of pressure , of coercion , of oppression that Palestinians have been facing in the West Bank , which is part and parcels of Israel apartheid regime , has received such a scant attention , because all eyes now are on Gaza , which has given the opportunity to Israeli settlers and to Israeli policymakers to actually escalate their campaign of forcible transfer and of settlement expansion . AMY GOODMAN : Budour Hassan , we want to thank you so much for being with us , Amnesty International researcher on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories . Again , we will link to Amnesty report headlined Damning evidence of war crimes as Israeli attacks wipe out entire families in Gaza . When we come back , we speak with the Pulitzer Prize winning author Viet Thanh Nguyen about his new memoir , A Man of Two Faces : A Memoir , a History , a Memorial . A major talk in New York was canceled after he signed , along with hundreds and hundreds of writers , a letter calling for a ceasefire . Stay with us .',\n",

              " 'US says it will retaliate if American forces are attacked in Middle East US diplomat Blinken was speaking as the possibility of the conflict spreading across the Middle East rises . United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Washington is prepared to retaliate if US troops are targeted in the course of the Israel Hamas war , as the possibility of the conflict spreading across the Middle East rises . Blinken , who was speaking during an interview on NBC Meet the Press , said he expects the war to escalate through involvement by proxies of Iran , adding that the administration of US President Joe Biden is prepared to respond if American personnel become the target of any such hostilities . We are taking steps to make sure that we can effectively defend our people and respond decisively if we need to , Blinken said , noting that additional military assets had been deployed to the Middle East , including two aircraft carrier battle groups . The US diplomat also said Israel does not want to rule the Gaza Strip after the war with Hamas draws to a close , according to his discussions with Israeli officials . But he emphasised that after the war , there could be no return to the status quo . You Israel can not be in a position where you are constantly exposed to the threat of the most terrible terrorist attacks from the Gaza Strip , said Blinken . So something needs to be found that ensures that Hamas ca do this again , but that also does revert to Israeli governance of Gaza , which they do not want and do not intend to do . Israel army has been bombing Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip since bloody attacks by Hamas on October 7 . At the weekend , the Israeli Air Force increased its attacks again in preparation for a ground offensive on Gaza . It is currently unclear what plan Israel has for the period after the expected ground offensive is completed . Meanwhile , US President Biden on Sunday held a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the situation in Israel and Gaza , the White House said . Biden also spoke with Pope Francis on Sunday .',\n",

              " 'US China ties under scrutiny amid West Asia crisis Gurjit Singh Former Ambassador THE arrival of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Washington on Thursday has raised hopes of a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping during the APEC Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit to be held in San Francisco next month . The summit in New Delhi had witnessed a meeting between Biden and Chinese Premier Li Qiang , even as Xi chose to skip the event . Weeks later , the world was rocked by the conflict in West Asia . China hosted the Belt and Road Initiative BRI summit on October 17 18 , while holding out the promise of a Xi Biden meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit , but putting forth its conditions quite clearly . China acknowledges that there are many differences with the US , but these can be bridged if a commonality is worked out . As always , the Chinese are looking for mutual respect among their core interests . China wants the US to back off on Taiwan , as it perceives that the US is mobilising Japan , the Philippines and Australia to robustly challenge it . Beijing also wants that the issues of democracy and human rights should not be raised by the US . China is keen that its path to development within its economic and political order should not be unduly criticised or impeded by America and its allies . It decries sanctions on hi tech exports by the US , and the encouragement to decoupling and China plus one policies . China also wants to avoid the autocracy vs democracy debate . What does it offer in return ? It offers the possibility of a management of the world since it has Russia firmly behind it . If it gets that opportunity , it promises to offer a constructive and cooperative relationship with the US . Meanwhile , it has imposed curbs on graphite exports to counter the US move to inhibit technology exports to China . China , it seems , is seeking a panda moment again in its ties with the US . Some of the pandas gifted to the US around 1972 are scheduled to return to China in December this year , but if a Xi Biden summit is held in November , new pandas may actually come to the US and bring new green shoots . There is no indication that the US would accept these Chinese terms . The crisis in West Asia has brought instability well beyond Ukraine and Taiwan , which the US is scrounging to control . This is because the Israeli factor has a strong domestic dimension in the US . Yet , Israeli actions have the potential of undoing the Abraham Accords and the consequent economic progress through peace under the West Asia plan . This is where China West Asia interests come into play . China has been creating an alternative alliance with Russia and Iran , whose main aim is to destabilise American policies . Since Iran is in the US brokered Accords , this could mean adopting an anti Israel attitude and provoking an Arab reaction against Israel where feasible . The quick pace of the Accords and the speed with which Saudi Arabia was moving towards a rapprochement with Israel was unsettling for the perceived loss of influence for China . China invested considerably in the Saudi Iran rapprochement in March this year . Saudi Arabian embrace of Israel is impacting Chinese interests . Therefore , the Hamas attack against Israel , whether provoked by Iran , China or others , is manna from heaven for the Chinese policy in West Asia . Neither China nor Russia has condemned Hamas , but they continue to criticise Israel for its Palestinian policy . Given China influence with Iran , it is noticeable that the US has not directly blamed Iran for the Hamas strikes . This is to keep the pot boiling and allowing China leeway in the region . The Chinese aim is to exploit the situation to side with Hamas and Arab nations . It hopes to find a role as a mediator in West Asia , which is actually an arena of US policy preferences . The China Russia Iran axis will work towards this end . Zhai Jun , China special envoy to West Asia , met Mikhail Bogdanov , the Russian President special representative for West Asia and Africa , in Qatar last week and enunciated this strategy . Condemning Israel , not criticising Hamas , fostering Arab unity and resumption of peace talks between Palestine and Israel for a two state solution , preferably facilitated by China , are the objectives . A bigger Chinese role will be a reduction of the US influence , and hence Washington may seek a cooperative complementary effort with China to address the Israeli quagmire . After Biden less than successful visit to Israel and sensing the anguish of the Arabs , it will perhaps become clear to the Americans that to safeguard their West Asia policy , they may have to work more closely with China . Perhaps that will prevent Saudi Arabia from ditching Israel firmly and not give Iran avenues to further destabilise the region . Managing these two could have a Chinese role . The recent expansion of BRICS is proving useful for China . South Africa is better aligned with China West Asia policy . Saudi Arabia , Iran , Egypt and the UAE are now part of BRICS . China is working with each of them to build a place for itself . However , at the BRI summit , the only senior Arab leaders were the Egyptian PM and the UAE special representative . The China Arab summit in December 2022 mentioned the Arab countries as a new strategic pillar of multilateral partnership for China . China views this as an instance of South South cooperation and a part of building communities with a shared future . The emergence of a cooperation system has energy cooperation at the core and includes infrastructure , trade and investment . It seeks to utilise technologies related to nuclear energy , space and new energy as elements of cooperation . After its Saudi Iran initiative , China now has the opportunity to extend its influence in the region amid the Israel Hamas war .

              " 'Opinion Why the World Is Watching Iran The Middle East could be on the verge of a regional conflagration . That in stark contrast to the atmosphere of just a few weeks ago , when the Biden administration was working on sealing a historic deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel that it hoped would stabilize a region long convulsed by war and sectarianism . Now , in the wake of Hamas 7 attack , Israel appears to be preparing to invade Gaza . Israeli forces and the Iranian backed militant group Hezbollah are firing at each other at the Lebanon border . Protests have erupted in cities across the region . The United States has moved two carrier strike groups into the eastern Mediterranean , and on Thursday a Navy warship shot down missiles and drones from Yemen that the military says may have been headed toward Israel . In a sign that the Pentagon expects similar attacks in the days ahead , on Saturday the military said it would increase its missile defense capability in the region to help protect forces . At the center of these mounting tensions is Iran , which has been engaged in a shadow war with its chief regional rival , Israel , for years . On 10 , Iran supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , applauded the deadly terrorist attack by Hamas , which is part of a loose network of nonstate armed groups that Iran uses to bolster its influence in the region . Tehran has denied any involvement in the attack , and Israeli and American officials acknowledge that there is no direct evidence proving otherwise . But as Iran rages over the ever mounting casualties in Gaza and what it perceives as America interference , fears are growing that this on again off again proxy war , waged through Hamas in the south and Hezbollah in the north , will break out into a sustained conflict , potentially even dragging in the United States . Iran may not have ordered Hamas attack , but government officials in Washington believe Tehran bears responsibility for enabling Hamas to gain the military capability and expertise to carry out the complex attack that has killed at least Israelis and captured some 200 hostages . Days after the attack , Washington and Doha , Qatar , announced that Tehran would be denied access to 6 billion that had been recently unfrozen as a result of a prisoner swap between the United States and Iran . Each year , Iran doles out hundreds of millions of dollars to improve the combat effectiveness of Hezbollah , Hamas and other militant groups in the region , including the Houthis in Yemen and an assortment of Iraqi Shia militias . With that funding , the groups , which Tehran has supported for decades as part of its axis of resistance , have developed an extensive assortment of capabilities , ranging from unmanned aerial systems to high end ballistic missile arsenals that would be the envy of most national militaries . Training and equipping terrorists , insurgents and militias is a core element of Iran foreign and security policy in the Middle East . At the vanguard of this effort is the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force , an elite unit responsible for conducting covert activities , including the sponsorship of groups like Hamas . IRGC QF trainers and advisers provide hands on instruction to militants on how to plan ambushes , improve operational security and gain proficiency with emerging technologies and cutting edge weapons systems . The success of this training was evident in the way Hamas used drones to knock out the Israel Defense Force cellular communications and surveillance towers along the border with Gaza in its recent attack . Iran uses proxy forces to advance its national security objectives : pushing adversaries like the United States , which has more than troops stationed across various facilities in the Middle East , out of the region and expanding its own sphere of influence without generating a direct military response from rivals . Proxy forces allow Tehran to meddle in ongoing conflicts in the background , maintaining a thin veneer of deniability and avoiding being pulled into a direct military confrontation with militarily superior foes namely , Israel and the United States . It also gives Tehran leverage as its proxy groups develop political wings , helping Iran play kingmaker in local and national politics in Iraq , Lebanon , Yemen and elsewhere . These proxy war tactics have been a success . Hamas and Hezbollah have inflicted serious damage in Israel without bringing the war home to Iran and have sent a clear message to Jerusalem that Tehran , if it wants to , is able to wage a campaign of asymmetric warfare that combines conventional and unconventional military capabilities . But that paradigm may be about to change . Many longtime Middle East watchers believe that the driving force behind Hamas attack was an overarching imperative from both Hamas leadership and Tehran to disrupt the momentum of the normalization agreement between Israel and Iran other longtime nemesis in the region , Saudi Arabia . And it may have worked . The images of death and destruction coming out of Gaza and the mounting death toll of Palestinian civilians could ultimately prove to be too much for Saudi Arabia to ignore . For the time being , any normalization talks between Saudi Arabia and Israel have been shelved . But Tehran has gone much further than disrupting talks . The IRGC QF commander , Ismail Qaani , appears to be coordinating Iran various proxy forces more closely , even reportedly organizing regular meetings since August between the heads of Hezbollah , Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad , another militant group that is active in Gaza . Accordingly , the fighting since 7 has not been limited to Gaza . Israel has launched strikes into Lebanon in response to Hezbollah missiles that have been fired into its territory . The exchange so far has followed a long running pattern of tit for tat reprisals . Still , Israel , concerned that Hezbollah fighters may be preparing to ramp up attacks and launch a sustained offensive in response to an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza , has announced the evacuation of more than two dozen communities along its border with Lebanon , including one small city of some residents . As the conflict intensifies , there are growing concerns that Israel may be headed toward a more direct confrontation with Iran . military stationed in the region have also faced threats from Iran backed groups in recent days . On 17 , after scores of Palestinians were killed in a hospital bombing , Ayatollah Khamenei accused the United States of fomenting the chaos that is threatening to envelop the region , taking to X , the social media site formerly known as Twitter : The Zionist regime policy is being regulated by the Americans , he said . The is responsible for the recent crimes . And while the Biden administration provided evidence , based on the intelligence it has seen , that the hospital strike was an errant Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket , the fuse has already been lit , with protests continuing throughout the region . Protesters tried to storm the Israeli Embassy in Amman , Jordan , and violent demonstrators targeted the Israeli consulate in Istanbul . If Hezbollah decides to take advantage of the overstretched Israel Defense Forces and officially open up a second front on Israel northern border , the situation could escalate and deteriorate quickly . Even the slightest miscalculation by Iran or one of its proxies could result in a dramatic response by the Israelis , potentially pulling in the United States and setting the stage for a bitter regional conflict .

              " 'US Strikes Iran Backed Sites In Syria After Attacks On Its Troops , Warns Of More Action New Delhi : President Joe Biden ordered strikes on two facilities in Syria after troops were attacked more than a dozen times in Iraq and Syria in the past week , the Pentagon said , warning that the will not tolerate attacks by Iran proxies . The suspects that Iran backed groups such as Hamas , Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah are behind the attacks . Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said at the on Thursday that the will not be spared from this fire if Israel offensive against Hamas does not stop . The military carried out strikes on Thursday against two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and groups it supports , the Pentagon said . These precision self defence strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups that began on October 17 , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement . These Iranian backed attacks against forces are unacceptable and must stop , Austin said . Biden has sent a rare message to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning Tehran against targeting personnel in the Middle East , the White House said earlier on Thursday . Israel said on Friday that it was preparing the next stage of the operation in Gaza , amid fears that a ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave could spark a wider Middle East conflict . Israel has pounded the densely populated Gaza Strip following the 7 Hamas attack on Israeli communities . Israel says Hamas killed some people including children , and took more than 200 hostages , some of them infants and older adults . The Hamas controlled Gaza health ministry said on Thursday that Palestinians had been killed in the retaliatory air strikes , including children . A missile launched as part of fighting between Hamas and Israel struck an Egyptian resort town about 220 km 135 miles from the Gaza Strip early on Friday , Egypt Al Qahera News reported , citing sources . The missile hit a medical facility in Taba , injuring at least six people , Al Qahera TV reported . A witness in Taba confirmed hearing an explosion and seeing smoke rising , but Reuters was not immediately able to identify the blast source . Taba is located on Egypt border with Israel Red Sea port of Eilat . Israel military said it was aware of a security incident outside its borders . Israel said on Friday that its fighter jets had struck three senior Hamas operatives in the Daraj Tuffah Battalion , part of the Gaza City Brigade . Israel said the three commanders had played a significant role in the 7 attack on Israel . There was no official announcement by Hamas . Palestinian militants clashed with Israeli troops in at least two areas of the Gaza Strip on Friday , Hamas affiliated media reported . Israeli military vehicles raided the central area of Al Bureij and troops were clashing with militants near the border there , the reports said .

Once the generators stop running , hospitals will \" turn into morgues \" , the Red Cross has warned . Hospitals are also struggling with a dramatic shortage of medicines and equipment . \" There not enough anaesthetic , \" said Ahmad Abdul Hadi , an orthopaedic surgeon working at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis . \" The wounded are in severe pain but we ca wait for the procedure so we forced to do the operation .

Petrol stations in the southern town of Rafah had also run dry . \" We ask God for the fuel to arrive so cars , tractors , ambulances and UNRWA operations can function to help the people , \" taxi driver Ibrahim Namla told AFP . \" If fuel does enter Gaza today or tomorrow , it will be a disaster . \" And there has been no let up in the strikes , with one hitting a building in Rafah where many children were inside , residents said . \" We saw the children being bombarded while their mother was hugging them , \" said Umm Omar al Khaldi , whose neighbours were killed . \" Where are the Arabs ?

              " 'Into the abyss For those who have been going red in the face arguing for the need to stamp out offensive , derogatory , and defamatory posts online , the Gaza War has confirmed that the monster known as social media has tipped us into the abyss . There is no coming back from a situation wherein a grandmother murder by Hamas terrorists was photographed by her executioners and posted to her Facebook account . The brutal , inhumane video appeared on her grandson Facebook news feed and on that of her friends and family members because it was uploaded from her own account . Is this an extreme example of the grotesqueness of social media ? Of course . But after two decades of allowing impunity to those who get away with targeting individuals with violent threats and virulent allegations , nobody should be surprised that extremists are using this template for their own ends . That the information war is such a critical aspect of century armed conflict makes disinformation an integral part of military operations . In the case of the Israeli grandmother , Facebook algorithms deployed to spot violent content that appears on sites run by extremists could not prevent the photos from being uploaded because ordinary people with no history of posting violent videos were obviously not part of the metric . It bears keeping in mind that it is so called ordinary people who , historically , have done the most damage . As Darrell West of the Brookings Institute writes in a recent article , the tragedy of the elderly Israeli woman reveals the challenges facing social media platforms during times of conflict . Tech companies , he adds , are going to have to figure out how to identify violent content and remove it before it reaches thousands or millions of people . If it takes Facebook , Twitter , YouTube , Telegram . hours to take down such material , as is usually the case unless one has the money to pay humungous legal fees for top lawyers to appear at the drop of a hat , terror organisations are guaranteed large numbers of viewers for their barbaric and inhumane actions . Advertisement Realistically , it is too late to do anything but write about this phenomenon for posterity to take note . Because whether it is individuals airing fantastic conspiracy theories online without fear of sanction or terrorist organisations posting brutal murders , they have broader strategic goals to achieve . All of them need to document their actions and push them out to large numbers of viewers . In that way , they can pressurise individuals in decision making positions and terrorise innocent civilians around the world . Social media platforms not only allow but effectively encourage this ; algorithms can not measure motives and distinguish posts meant legitimately to inform versus those designed to inflame defame . It is an ugly new world .',\n",

              " 'Israel Strikes on Gaza Are Some of the Most Intense This Century Israel 19 day bombing campaign in Gaza has become one of the most intense of the century , prompting growing global scrutiny of its scale , purpose and cost to human life . Since terrorists from Gaza raided Israel on 7 , killing roughly people according to the Israeli government , the Israeli military says it has struck more than targets inside Gaza . That is a higher number than in any previous Israeli military campaign in the territory , a narrow enclave less than half the size of New York City . It also outstrips the most intense month of the United States led bombing campaign against ISIS , according to Airwars , a British conflict monitor . For Palestinians , the scale of the bombing campaign has appeared vengeful and unfocused , killing Gazans from across a wide spectrum of civilian life and destroying residential areas . The Hamas run Gazan health ministry says Israeli strikes have killed more than people , a number that if verified would make this the deadliest conflict for Palestinians since at least the Lebanon war of 1982 . But to Israelis , there is a necessity and a method to their strikes , which they say are not about retaliation but defense . The campaign , Israeli officials say , is focused on degrading Gazan military infrastructure that is often built near homes and civilian institutions . Officials and analysts warn that a potential ground invasion of Gaza could be even bloodier than the air war . They argue that strikes that ease an Israeli ground advance will help reduce the loss of life for Palestinian civilians and Israeli soldiers alike , once the invasion begins .',\n",

              " 'UK Lawmakers Roll Out Legislation to Seize Cryptocurrencies UK Lawmakers Roll Out Legislation to Seize Cryptocurrencies Used for Illegal Purposes The UK Parliament has passed a bill that allows law enforcement authorities to seize cryptocurrencies associated with illicit activities . This includes investment scams , hacks , terrorism financing , money laundering , and drug trafficking . Per an official announcement on its website , the new bill , dubbed the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act , will expand the authority of local law enforcement to clamp down and recover digital assets linked to cybercrimes . Today the Economic Crime Act became law . This is landmark legislation that should significantly strengthen Britain defences against fraud and money laundering , clamping down on those who abuse our economy for their own private gain . Transparency International UK October 26 , 2023 The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill was passed on October 25 and received formal approval Royal Assent on October 26 . One of the bill provisions is the confiscation of digital assets linked to illicit activities without conviction . Additionally , the law intends to combat using cryptocurrencies to fund terrorism . This is an issue the United States is facing with the ongoing post Isreal war with Hamas , a military Sect in Palestine . In the past , law enforcement in the UK had to wait for a successful prosecution before seizing digital assets . However , the new legislature offers a much quicker solution that empowers local enforcement units to process crypto recovery actions . The bill was originally introduced in September 2022 but has now been revised to encompass terrorism related crimes and assist authorities in tracking transactions . Despite the UK efforts to support and promote the cryptocurrency industry , it has integrated stringent laws and intensified efforts to mitigate crypto crimes . The UK Economic Crime Plan Suffers Limitation While the Parliament is making headway with laws , the Financial Conduct Authority FCA is encountering difficulties regulating cryptocurrency firms that violate its new regulations . Recently , global exchange Binance had to shut down the registration of new customers in the UK due to the FCA suspending RebuildingSociety . According to a statement by the FCA on October 25 , crypto firms have breached the marketing rules up to 221 times . Find out the 3 common issues we identified with cryptoasset financial promotions . Consumers should check the FCA Warning List before making any investment in Financial Conduct Authority October 25 , 2023 The UK regulator latest announcement comes after it reported the issuance of 146 alerts on October 9 due to the breaches of its promotion rules 24 hours after they were enacted . Rather than provide standard information about risks associated with assets offered , trading platforms keep making claims about safety , security , and the ease of crypto trades . Before this latest rule breach , the UK financial watchdog integrated a stringent financial promotion framework on October 8 , requiring exchanges to stop promoting faux trading investment schemes to entice residents . The new rules cite that crypto related advertisements can only be promoted or approved by FCA authorized firms and apply to all businesses , even those without a UK presence . The promotions must have detailed information on assets and trading risk and not use incentives like referral bonuses and memes to lure trades to invest . Failure to provide accurate marketing information to traders included penalties such as fines and potential jail terms . In addition , offenders face being added to the regulator warning list , which already contains Huobi , KuCoin , and 143 other exchanges . While FCA lacks the wits to keep crypto platforms in check , collaborations with app stores , social media platforms , domain name registers , and search engines are in motion to stop the flow of operations on banned platforms .',\n",

              " 'Why increasing border talks between Bhutan and China are a cause for alarm in India Away from the theatre of the Israel Hamas war in West Asia and far away from Canada whose government soft stand towards the Khalistanis is troubling India , a new development in Bhutan foreign relations has become India latest worry due to its far reaching implications for India security . Bhutan , a small Kingdom tucked away in the lap of the mighty Himalayas has been taking baby steps towards global outreach for a long time now . It once was known for its closed approach to global politics where it did not even maintain diplomatic relations with the permanent five countries of the UN Security Council . Its stand was informed by a need to stay clear from power politics as Bhutan remained introverted and closed to the world around it . But all that had started to change in the recent years . Since the beginning of the current century , Bhutan has been focussing on forging new diplomatic connections . By 2013 , it had managed to establish a diplomatic relationship with as many as 53 countries . Among all the new foreign relations that Bhutan is sealing , its equation with China is agonising India a lot . Early this week , Bhutan foreign minister Tandi Dorji visited Beijing . There he met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi as well as Vice President of China Han Zheng . The visit was focussed on boundary talks between the two countries and also saw the signing of an agreement over the functioning of a Joint Technical Team for the same . Both countries also agreed to expedite the boundary demarcation process as well as establish formal diplomatic ties with each other . The settlement of the boundary issue between Bhutan and China will leave India as the only country out of China 12 neighbours with which Beijing has still not settled the boundary dispute . The possible establishment of diplomatic relations between Bhutan and China is also a worrying signal for India but it is the boundary dispute settlement that will have the most far reaching implications for Indian security . The boundary dispute between Bhutan and China goes back to the when China annexed Tibet and both countries became immediate neighbours . Unlike the relationship between autonomous Tibet and Bhutan where the border was not demarcated , China never agreed to the boundary that it inherited after its annexation of Tibet . It in fact seized control of eight Bhutanese conclaves in Tibet during its military campaign in 1959 . Due to China belligerence and its tendency to acquire territory by force , Bhutan severed its ties with China controlled Tibet and maintained a very sharp distance from Beijing diplomatically . Mao Zedong foreign policy strategy of considering Bhutan along with Nepal as one of the five fingers of Tibet , China right hand palm was like a nightmare for the Bhutanese . Since then , China has conducted multiple incursions into Bhutan territories including in 1967 , 1979 , 1983 and 2017 . China claims around 764 sq km of Bhutanese territory in the northern and western areas . This includes Jakarlung and Pasamlung areas in north Bhutan and the Doklam plateau in Western Bhutan . China pressurising tactics of using military force and publishing maps with outrageous claims had been able to bring Bhutan to the negotiating table in the past . The two countries started negotiating the border dispute on an annual basis in 1984 . They also signed an agreement to maintain peace at the border in 1998 . Since 1984 , they have held 24 rounds of boundary talks and the one that was held earlier this week marks the round of boundary talks between them . Now the question is that if boundary talks are progressing at a fast pace between China and Bhutan then why does it worry India so much ? Well , the entire bone of contention is the Doklam plateau . Doklam area is a trijunction point between India , China and Bhutan . It is a part of the Bhutanese territory but China claims it as an extension of its Chumbi Valley . China has made multiple claims on the area and in 2017 , it even started construction of a road in the mountainous region . It was attempting to create infrastructure in the region in order to usurp the territory during border settlement at a later date . In fact , satellite imagery has proven how China created high tech villages in the area . India worries regarding China acquiring control of Doklam stems from the fact that this plateau overlooks the strategic Siliguri corridor also known as the Chicken Neck which not only connects mainland India to its own northeastern states but also serves as an important international gateway by linking India with countries such as Myanmar and even Tibet . It was for this reason that India immediately pressed its military into action in 2017 in order to retaliate against China act of constructing a road in the area . The resultant stand off had lasted for more than 70 days with India being successful in thwarting China from constructing the road . This time , however , India tensions are even more profound . China pressurising tactics have left little choice for Bhutan . In 2020 , China sprung a surprise when it made an entirely new claim out of the blue over the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary situated in Eastern Bhutan . It was an attempt by China to put more pressure on Bhutan to admit the claims that China is making under the usual boundary dispute . India key worry is that China may push Bhutan so much to the edge that it will be forced to accept a swap deal where China will relinquish its claims in the north in exchange for control over the Doklam plateau . A precedent for this actually exists because in 1998 , China had made a similar offer to Bhutan which it had not accepted at that time . It is interesting to note that Beijing is keen to settle the boundary dispute with Bhutan but it has not shown a similar zeal towards settling its boundary dispute with India . This shows that the entire plan of China is to keep India on tenterhooks . Firstly , Beijing does want to deliberately delay settling of boundary dispute with India because a settled boundary will provide India with much relief and free up its energy to focus on its rise . In contrast , an unsettled boundary will keep a check on India power . Secondly , any settlement of the boundary issue with Bhutan which involves China getting control over Doklam will be the best blessing for Beijing against India in this century . It will end up making India severely vulnerable by threatening its access to its own northeast in the situation of a military conflict . It is in this context that any development in Bhutan China relations must be observed . Although India consistently points towards a 2012 understanding reached between China and India that the Bhutan China boundary dispute will not include discussions over Doklam . Provided China record of honouring agreements that it has signed up for in the past , India has all the reasons to be concerned about the direction which Bhutan China boundary negotiation will take .

The 80 year old US president said Washington would respond should Tehran escalate the conflict in the Middle East . Biden made these remarks during a Washington joint press conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Wednesday as they shared their stand on Israel , Ukraine , and China during a state visit . We have had troops in the region since to go after ISIS and prevent its reemergence in the region having nothing to do with Israel at all . My warning to the Ayatollah was that if they continue to move against those troops , we will respond , and he should be prepared . It has nothing to do with Israel . , he said , according to a transcript released by the White House . President Biden met with Prime Minister Albanese in the Oval Office to strengthen the alliance and discuss key priorities including advancing a free and open Indo Pacific , supporting Ukraine , and standing with Israel in the wake of Hamas terrorist attack . The White House October 25 , 2023 Albanese visit underscored the importance Washington places on longtime ally Australia as a cornerstone of its strategy against an increasingly assertive Beijing in the Asia Pacific region . A great deal of the history of our world will be written in the Indo Pacific in the coming years , Biden said , using the allies term for the region . Australia and the United States must write that story together . During a day of pomp and ceremony at the White House , Biden said the alliance between Australia and the United States is an anchor to peace and prosperity . At a joint press conference with Biden , Albanese said the bond between the two countries was crucial in an uncertain world . The relationship between Australia and the United States has never been more important . And it has never been stronger than it is right now , he said . Though the US Australia alliance focuses much of its might on the Indo Pacific , the majority of Biden press conference on Wednesday was centered around the Middle East . Biden said both nations were standing with Israel against Hamas terrorism . Following the October 7 Hamas attack and subsequent Israeli response in Gaza , Biden has repeatedly warned Iranian proxy groups such as Hezbollah , which the government considers a terrorist organization , not to use the current war as cover to launch attacks .',\n",

              " 'Meta faces US lawsuit for allegedly fueling youth mental health crisis Surging falsehoods seek to dent Western aid to Ukraine WASHINGTON : From fake street art to doctored media reports demonizing President Volodymyr Zelensky , a torrent of online disinformation seeks to erode Western support that is crucial for Kyiv war effort against Russia . The falsehoods , experts say , are aimed at provoking anti Ukraine sentiment in Western countries while lending credence to the notion that war weary European and American allies are turning against Zelensky . The wave of disinformation comes as Kyiv is scrambling to retain Western support while attention shifts to the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas ahead of what is expected to be another winter bombing campaign by Russia . The disinformation campaigns take place in multiple countries and languages , and their intensification suggest concerted efforts , Roman Osadchuk , from the Atlantic Council Digital Forensic Research Lab DFRLab , told AFP . The main objective of Russia here is to put a wedge in Western societies , polarizing them and portraying the help for Ukraine as problematic . These efforts are aimed at political elites and the general population , some of whom might not closely follow the war , making them more vulnerable to the false narratives . AFP factcheckers have exposed a series of doctored images of street art mocking Zelensky , who has faced an avalanche of disinformation since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022 . That includes fake photos shared across social media platforms of graffiti in cities such as Warsaw , Berlin and Paris depicting Zelensky devouring money from his Western allies . No such graffiti was found . identified twelve Facebook pages using deceptive bait and switch tactics to push Ukrainians to three Telegram channels that publish dubious news coverage of the war and prompt users to join additional Telegram channels . latest : DFRLab August 1 , 2023 Fabricated reports AFP factcheckers have also uncovered fabricated German and French media reports about graffiti depicting Zelensky engaging in cannibalism . The media outlets confirmed that the posts circulating on platforms such as Facebook and Telegram were fake . When Zelensky visited the United States last month , a doctored online video appeared to show a New York city billboard with the words glory to urine alongside an image of the Ukrainian leader . The manipulated clip was watermarked with the logo for Fox News Digital , but a network spokesperson told AFP that it had not posted any such footage . It remains unclear precisely who is behind the false claims but they fit a broader pattern of anti Ukraine disinformation by Russia , which for decades has engaged in information warfare focused on fueling anti Western sentiments , researchers say . There has been a visible growth of Russian propaganda in Europe compared to the first few months of 2022 , Ruslan Trad , a resident fellow for security research at the DFRLab , told AFP . The Kremlin is capitalizing on war fatigue and apathy , as well as the Euroskepticism and fears of Western and Central European societies . Raising concerns about cracks in Western support for Kyiv , Slovakia new populist Prime Minister Robert Fico on Thursday said he had informed the European Union executive of his decision to stop military aid to Ukraine . Soon after last month general election which Fico won on pledges to end assistance to Ukraine Slovakia accused Moscow of interfering in the vote by deliberately disseminating falsehoods . Even in the United States Kyiv biggest donor of security aid there are concerns that opposition from hard line Republican lawmakers has put future assistance for Kyiv in doubt . President Joe Biden is currently pushing Congress to approve a massive 106 billion security bill , which includes 61 billion in military aid for Ukraine . On Thursday , Washington announced a new 150 million military assistance package for Ukraine that includes artillery and small arms ammunition as well as anti tank weapons . Zelensky thanked the US for the assistance , saying strengthening air defense is critical to protect Ukrainian cities and infrastructure as winter approaches . Ukraine is bracing itself for a renewed Russian bombing campaign on its energy infrastructure , which last year plunged millions of civilians into extreme hardship . The European Union has also vowed steadfast support . Earlier this month , the European Parliament endorsed a proposal to provide an extra 50 billion euros 53 billion for Ukraine recovery . But despite these robust pledges , US officials cited by local media have warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks to end American and European support for Ukraine by using his spy agencies to push propaganda and conspiracy theories . Russia is benefiting right now from decades of information activities , said Adam Lelonek , from the International Republican Institute Beacon Project . Russia can not win this conventional war but still aspires to win in the information dimension .',\n",
              " 'Why the IDF will struggle to neutralise Gaza tunnels An Israeli ground invasion of Gaza will have to reckon with what lies underground : a labyrinth of tunnels , controlled and operated by Hamas , will be a key battlefield . The network of approximately tunnels is thought to be around 500 km in length , with the deepest lying 70 m underground , DW reported . Most are about 2 m in width and height . Advertisement According to John Spencer of the US Military Academy West Point , the sheer scale of the tunnel system underneath Gaza poses a wicked problem for which no perfect solution exists , and overcoming which , will require a lot of time . We look at when and why these tunnels came into existence , what they are used for , and why they pose such a challenge to the Israel Defense Forces IDF . A lifeline for a besieged people The earliest tunnels underneath Gaza were probably dug as far back as the . But their scale and sophistication went up after Israel tightened its blockade of Gaza in 2007 . Advertisement For besieged Gazans , tunnels are a lifeline which provides them all kinds of essential items , from food and medicine , to hygiene products and electronics . Many lie on Gaza border with Egypt , from where goods are smuggled into the enclave through the city of Rafah in the Sinai peninsula . Advertisement Prior to 2013 , when Egypt cracked down on cross border smuggling , the 12 km long Egypt Gaza border had as many as tunnels and moved as much as 500 tons of steel and tons of cement daily . Advertisement For Hamas , which has poured millions of dollars into the construction and upkeep of these tunnels , they are of existential importance for Gazans keeping the enclave battered economy afloat . A great equaliser These tunnels are also of existential importance to Hamas , smuggling weaponry and military equipment into Gaza as well . Moreover , beyond tunnels used for smuggling in the southern border , Hamas has also built ones explicitly for military purposes . Must Read A to Z of the Israel Palestine conflict Underneath Gaza , there are series of defensive tunnels , used as military command centres and for weapons storage . According to western military experts , these are the tunnels through which Hamas orchestrates its military operations against Israel , as well as where it is likely hiding hostages . Advertisement Attached to these , are offensive tunnels on the border with Israel , used for cross border attacks and other operations . It was these tunnels that were Israel casus belli during the 2014 escalation . The tunnels allow fighters to move between a series of fighting positions safely and freely , Spencer , an expert in urban warfare , explained . In short , the tunnels are a great equaliser , neutralising Israel advantages in weaponry , tactics , technology and organisation . Tackling the tunnels Given how important tunnels are for Hamas , they will be a top priority for the IDF during a ground invasion . But eliminating them altogether will not be easy . First and foremost is the problem of locating these tunnels , which experts say is akin to finding a needle in a haystack . Even with the availability of modern surveillance technology including radar , thermal imaging , and magnetic signatures , most tunnels are found by human detective work . This is why it is impossible to accurately say just how big the tunnel system underneath Gaza is . An Israeli soldier during a media tour organised by the army of a tunnel said to be used by Palestinians for cross border attacks , on the Israel Gaza border , July 25 , 2014 . Jack Guez Pool via The New York Times File Photo An Israeli soldier during a media tour organised by the army of a tunnel said to be used by Palestinians for cross border attacks , on the Israel Gaza border , July 25 , 2014 . Jack Guez Pool via The New York Times File Photo Second , even upon establishing their location , eliminating them is not a simple task . Sending in soldiers is fraught with risk as tunnels can easily be booby trapped . Fighting inside tunnels will also most certainly favour Hamas militants , with detailed knowledge of the terrain . Advertisement Bunker buster bombs , which can penetrate deep underground before exploding , risk extensive collateral damage , given how densely Gaza is populated . Although chemical agents have been used in the past , notably by the US in Vietnam , these would be regarded as illegal in the eyes of International Humanitarian Law . The IDF is highly trained for tunnel warfare , more than any other military force in the world according to Spencer . But the depth and scale of Gazan tunnels will take a long time to neutralise , and come at unthinkable human cost . Moreover , as Daphne Richemond Barak , author of Underground Warfare 2017 , noted in an article in Financial Times , even with Israel concerted efforts it is unlikely that the entirety of Gaza tunnel network would be destroyed .',\n",

Biden and bin Salman affirmed the importance of working toward a sustainable peace between Israelis and Palestinians as soon as the crisis subsides , building on the work that was already underway between Saudi Arabia and the United States over recent months , said a readout from the White House . Biden administration officials have acknowledged that the normalization effort is no longer the most immediate priority for the US and Israel , as they work to respond to the October 7 Hamas onslaught . However , the White House insists that it is still committed to the goal and has suggested that one of the reasons for the Hamas massacre was to try and thwart the effort .

              " 'What limits do the laws of war impose on combatants ? O N OCTOBER António Guterres pictured , secretary general of the UN , called for an end to the epic suffering caused by Israel blockade and bombing of the Gaza strip . Hundreds of people had died in the preceding 24 hours , and on Tuesday only eight aid lorries had entered the territory . Such conditions , Mr Guterres said , amounted to collective punishment of the Palestinian people for the bloody attack on Israel carried out on October by Hamas , the militant group that runs Gaza . He claimed there had been clear violations of international law in recent days : by Hamas , which is using civilians as human shields and holding more than 200 hostages ; and by Israel , when it ordered the evacuation of northern Gaza but continued to bomb the south . Israel condemned Mr Guterres comments and said he should resign . But he is not alone in calling for a measured response . On October , a joint statement from the leaders of six countries , including America , urged Israel to adhere to international humanitarian law without accusing the country of having broken it . What limits does the law of armed conflict impose on belligerents ? The principles that underlie the rules of warmaking go back centuries , often to religious texts . Deuteronomy , for example , instructs warriors to offer peace to the people before attacking . In 1625 Hugo Grotius , a Dutch philosopher , gave such rules a secular foundation . In On the Law of War and Peace he lamented a lack of restraint in relation to war and posited a common law among nations that would impose limits . Three centuries later world leaders settled on such a law in the guise of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 . All of the world countries have signed on to these principles , which protect wounded and sick combatants , prisoners of war , and civilians during wartime . Some countries have agreed with reservations , including the rejection of international courts jurisdiction over their actions . The law of war also encompasses customary rules general practices accepted as law despite not being formally agreed upon and more recent treaties prohibiting the use of biological and chemical weapons , among other grisly munitions . Violations of the law of war are difficult to prosecute ; many go unpunished . But armies that strive to adhere to the law of armed conflict follow four basic principles . The most sweeping , humanity , has its origins in the so called Martens clause a provision in the Hague Convention of 1899 , a precursor to the Geneva Conventions , that gives individuals protection under the dictates of public conscience in situations when no specific treaty governs . The second is military necessity , which permits only the degree of conflict that is required to achieve a valid military objective , such as the submission of the enemy and not , say , destruction of the natural environment or historic sites . The third , distinction , requires armed forces to clearly distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack so as to prevent the inadvertent targeting of non combatants . And finally , proportionality mandates that the pursuit of valid military goals can not cause undue civilian suffering . If the collateral damage to civilians lives or homes is excessive when set against the direct military advantage anticipated , proportionality requires combatants to limit or hold their fire . Humanity is a worthy starting point for the law of war but , because the principle is hazy , it can be hard to tell when combatants fail to uphold it . Other standards can be applied more clearly . Pursuing armed conflict to wipe out a population or despoil their land is plainly out of bounds . Soldiers who fail to wear proper uniforms violate the principle of distinction : Hamas fighters , some of whom allegedly wore Israeli military uniforms during their attack on the country , broke this rule . Military assaults that take no account of civilian casualties or deliberately target them also break international law . But proportionality , the principle guiding the latter example , is often misunderstood . It does not hinge on absolute casualty counts but on how harm to civilian lives and infrastructure is weighed against expected military gains . That means , theoretically , that rather a lot of suffering could be permissible . In 2013 Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch claimed that American drone strikes in countries including Afghanistan , Iraq and Pakistan , in which many civilians died , may have been disproportionate a claim that Barack Obama , then America president , denied , saying that in each case the potential loss of civilian life had been carefully weighed . There is no question that Hamas attacks on Israelis violated the law of war , and Mr Guterres is right that in using civilians as unwilling human shields it is committing a further breach of the Geneva Conventions . Israel , for its part , is allowed to instruct Palestinians to move away from the northern half of Gaza for their own protection , but this displacement must be temporary and adequate humanitarian relief must be provided . And under any interpretation of the law of war , Israel proportionality calculus must take account of the many civilian casualties its air strikes and pending ground invasion will cause . But legal opinion is split on how to undertake this accounting . Israel has in the past interpreted the rules to exclude damage to apartment buildings if terrorists occupy them . And although the International Committee of the Red Cross contends that human shields must be protected unless they are physically blocking a military objective , Israel and America believe that civilians who voluntarily serve as human shields are participants , not bystanders . Telling the difference is hard at the best of times and the fog of war makes clarity harder still .',\n",

              " 'Strikes by Islamists on US bases in Syria and Iraq raise fears of escalation Islamist militia linked to Iran have continued to strike US bases in Syria and Iraq , intensifying a campaign of violence that will raise fears of a regional conflagration . The attacks have been claimed by groups either directly controlled by Tehran or sharing the ideology of other groups currently fighting Israel . On Thursday , a US base at Kharab al Jir in Syria was attacked for the second time in two days , and a base in western Iraq was also hit . More than a dozen small scale strikes on US bases in the region have wounded 24 US soldiers and caused the death of one civilian contractor . Washington is rushing anti missile batteries to the region to protect its principal bases and allies . Charles Lister , the director of the Syria and countering terrorism and extremism programmes at the Middle East Institute in Washington , said : The US has now had two dozen soldiers injured . In any other conditions it would have responded but its hands are tied because it does not want to be blamed for escalating . The US government is very concerned that we are walking into a regional crisis . The attacks show that Iran has an extensive network of well armed , aggressive and well coordinated proxies across the region which it has established for exactly this scenario . They are currently testing redlines but not pushing too hard . They are putting the onus on the US to respond . Joe Biden has already ordered two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean and US officials are reported to have asked Israel to hold off on a ground invasion of Gaza until new anti missile units have reached their destinations . The war between Israel and Hamas has followed the terrorist attacks launched by Hamas into southern Israel , which killed people , mainly civilians . So far Israel bombardment of Gaza has killed , according to Hamas run health authorities in the enclave . Even without a ground offensive by Israeli troops into Gaza , the rising death toll there is likely to bring further escalation . One Iraq based and Iran supported group , believed to be a front for the long established Kateb Hezbollah , last week issued a statement threatening attacks on US military bases in the UAE and Kuwait . Paramilitaries from militia in Syria that are controlled by Iran have been deployed close to the Golan Heights , in a further threatening move . On Wednesday , leading officials of the three principal Islamist extremist groups currently at war with Israel met in Beirut to discuss the conflict . After the meeting in Lebanon , a brief statement said Hezbollah leader , Hassan Nasrallah , had agreed with Hamas Saleh al Arouri and Palestine Islamic Jihad leader , Ziad al Nakhleh , that the three along with other Iran backed militants wanted to achieve a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine and halt Israel treacherous and brutal aggression against our oppressed and steadfast people in Gaza and the West Bank . Tobias Borck , a senior research fellow in Middle East security studies at London Royal United Services Institute , said Iran was literally playing with fire . What we are seeing is the next level out from the Gazan war . This is all carefully calibrated to show solidarity . Iran is saying : we see the aircraft carriers but we are not scared and we can hurt you too . It is incredibly dangerous , Borck told the Guardian . A lot of people want to understand it as Tehran pulling the strings but actually these are partners who share a worldview and ideology . One element is claiming the mantle of leading the opposition to a western imposed order in the region . The impression of a growing regional conflict was reinforced by Israeli airstrikes against Syrian army infrastructure in response to rockets launched from Syria , an ally of Iran , last week . Syria state news agency said the attack near the south western city of Daraa killed eight soldiers . The strike followed the launch of two rockets that set off air raid sirens in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights . Israeli warplanes also bombed an airport in Aleppo , in northern Syria , in a move that experts said was probably intended to disrupt supplies of ammunition and arms from Iran to Hezbollah in Syria . Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israeli troops along the border between Lebanon and Israel since the day after the 7 October attacks . Both sides appear to have been trying to avoid escalation . An estimated 40 Hezbollah fighters have been killed in the clashes so far , while the Israeli military has also announced some deaths among its ranks .

Both sides are trying to pre empt any blame for further and greater hostilities . The White House said on Monday that the US had detected an uptick in rocket and drone attacks by Iranian backed proxy groups against military bases housing US personnel in Iraq and Syria and was deeply concerned about the potential for any significant escalation of these attacks in the days ahead .

              " 'EU foreign policy chief Borrell backs pause in Israel Hamas war Josep Borrell says getting more aid to Gaza is most important thing as bloc debates humanitarian pause . European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has backed calls for a pause in the Israel Hamas war , describing the limited supply of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip as not enough . Borrell said on Monday that the most important thing was to get more humanitarian aid to the besieged enclave , home to more than two million people . Personally , I think a humanitarian pause is needed in order to allow the humanitarian support to come in and be distributed , seeing that half of the population of Gaza has been moving from their houses , he told reporters before a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg . Borrell said Hamas also must stop its rocket attacks on Israel and release the more than 200 people Israeli officials say have been taken captive as part of any step towards de escalation . His comments came as the bloc debates calls for a pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas amid warnings of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza . Israel has been bombarding the enclave after imposing a total blockade , pledging to eliminate Hamas for the armed group October 7 attacks inside the country , which Israeli officials say killed more than people , mostly civilians . Israeli air raids have killed more than Palestinians , mainly children and women , in the enclave , according to Palestinian authorities . United Nations officials have warned that the million residents of Gaza are on the brink of starvation and at risk of cholera and other serious diseases due to the collapse of water and sanitation services . UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres last week called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the release of captives held by Hamas . The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that would have called for a pause in fighting to allow humanitarian assistance into the enclave while also condemning Hamas attacks inside Israel . While trucks carrying aid began entering Gaza on Saturday after a US mediated deal between Israel and Egypt , UN officials have warned that the volume is only a small fraction of the aid usually delivered to the Strip . On Sunday , Turkey Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said a plane had taken off for Egypt , carrying a medical team and supplies for Gaza . The EU has struggled to present a unified stance on the conflict , with confusing and sometimes contradictory messaging by officials raising tensions within the bloc . Ursula von der Leyen , the head of the European Commission , faced criticism for speaking on behalf of the bloc as a whole earlier this month after travelling to Israel to offer Europe backing in its war on Hamas . Borrell has condemned Israel blockade of Gaza , describing it as a violation of international law . On Friday , US President Joe Biden hosted European leaders , including von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel , at the White House for a summit intended to deliver a message of unity on conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine . In a statement released after the summit , the two sides condemned Hamas for its brutal terrorist attacks across Israel while expressing concern about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza .',\n",

              " 'US attacks facilities in Syria linked to Iran , Pentagon says The White House earlier warned it would respond to attacks on its forces in Iraq and Syria at time of our choosing . The United States has attacked two facilities in Syria used by Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iran backed groups , the Pentagon has said , following a series of attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria . The strikes came after President Joe Biden administration pledged to respond to attacks on US personnel that Washington has blamed on armed groups backed by Iran . The United States does not seek conflict and has no intention nor desire to engage in further hostilities , but these Iranian backed attacks against US forces are unacceptable and must stop , US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on Thursday . Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces . We will not let them . If attacks by Iran proxies against US forces continue , we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people . Austin said the narrowly tailored strikes were in self defence and were not connected to the Israel Hamas war . They are separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas , and do not constitute a shift in our approach to the Israel Hamas conflict , he said . White House National Security Council spokesman had earlier warned that Washington would respond to the attacks at a time of our choosing and a manner of our choosing . Kirby comments came as the US Department of Defense said on Thursday that US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 16 times this month by Iranian backed militia groups . A total of 21 US personnel have been injured in the attacks , most of them suffering traumatic brain injuries , according to US officials . Reports of attacks on US forces in the region have spiked since the outbreak of the Israel Hamas war , which began earlier this month when the Palestinian group launched an unprecedented attack on Israel that Israeli officials say killed more than people . Palestinian authorities say more than people have been killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza carried out in response to Hamas October 7 attacks . On Wednesday , Biden said he had directly warned Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei against targeting US troops in the Middle East . My warning to the ayatollah was that if they continue to move against those troops , we will respond , and he should be prepared , Biden told reporters , adding it has nothing to do with Israel . Washington and Tehran do not have formal diplomatic relations , and Biden did not say how the message was communicated . Mohammad Jamshidi , an aide to Iran President Ebrahim Raisi , disputed Biden account in a comment posted on social media . The US messages were neither directed to the leader of the Islamic Revolution nor were they anything but requests from the Iranian side , he said . If Biden thinks he has warned Iran , he should ask his team to show him the text of the messages . US officials are concerned about the possibility of fighting between Israel and Hamas escalating into a broader regional conflict . Iran backs both Hamas , which governs Gaza , and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah , which Israel has clashed with in skirmishes along the Israel Lebanon border . On Thursday , Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said at the United Nations that the US would not be spared from this fire if Israel bombardment of Gaza did not end . I say frankly to the American statesmen , who are now managing the genocide in Palestine , that we do not welcome an expansion of the war in the region , Amir Abdollahian said . But if the genocide in Gaza continues , they will not be spared from this fire .',\n",

The Israeli army , backed by fighter jets and drones , has carried out a second limited ground raid into Gaza in as many days and struck targets on the outskirts of Gaza City , according to its military , as it prepares for a widely expected ground invasion . The Israeli military said on Friday that ground forces entered Gaza overnight and struck dozens of Hamas targets during its raid in the Shujaiya area . It said aircraft and artillery bombed targets in the neighbourhood on the outskirts of Gaza City , and that its soldiers exited the territory after several hours without suffering any casualties . The raid began yesterday in broad daylight it ended successfully in the hours of this morning , the Israeli army spokesperson said . Black and white footage released by the Israeli army showed a column of armoured vehicles as a thick cloud of dust billowed into the sky after the strikes . Later on Friday , Hamas military wing said Israeli forces at dawn attempted to carry out a landing operation on the Rafah beach in southern Gaza Strip . The attempt was discovered by our fighters , and they confronted it and clashed with the enemy . This required the intervention of the Zionist Israeli Air Force , which saved the force , so it fled towards the sea , leaving behind a quantity of ammunition , the Qassam Brigades said in a Telegram post . The Israeli army had conducted another ground operation using tanks and infantry overnight on Thursday in the northern part of the Palestinian territory ; it said its ground forces battled fighters and struck antitank missile firing positions in an operation that lasted hours . Israeli military officials , on several occasions , have confirmed the army readiness to conduct a large scale ground operation in Gaza , but are awaiting a green light from the Israeli political leadership . At the same time , Israel continues its relentless bombardment of Gaza , which has killed more than Palestinians in three weeks . The strikes began following a Hamas attack inside Israel on October 7 , in which more than people were killed . The air raids have flattened entire neighbourhoods , causing a level of death and destruction unseen in the last four wars between Israel and Hamas . More than a million people have fled their homes in northern Gaza , with many heeding Israeli orders to evacuate to the south , despite continuing Israeli attacks across the sealed off territory . Satellite photos The damage to Gaza was shown in satellite photos of several locations taken before the war and again in recent days . Entire rows of residential buildings simply disappear in the photos , reduced to smears of dust and rubble . A complex of 13 high rises by the sea was pounded to dust near Gaza City al Shati refugee camp , leaving only a few tottering bits of facade . Just down the street , hardly anything remained in what had been a neighbourhood of low built homes on winding lanes , according to the photos by Maxar Technologies . Benny Gantz , a retired general and member of Israel war cabinet , said on Thursday that any possible ground offensive would be only one stage in a long term process that includes security , political and social aspects that will take years . The campaign will soon ramp up with greater force , he added . The humanitarian crisis caused by the war and the Israeli siege , and concern for the fate of Gaza million people , has sparked protests across the region , and more demonstrations were expected later on Friday after weekly Muslim prayers .',\n",

              " 'The perils of social media messaging Vivek Katju Former Secretary , Ministry of External Affairs INDIA response to the Hamas terror attack starkly shows the changing nature of its diplomatic practice and articulation . These transformations are driven partly by the pressures exerted by the media , both mainstream and social , which have diminished response times of the political leadership as well as diplomats to evolving regional or global crises . At the same time , the predilection of the top leadership to take to social media , even as events are unfolding , is also a major factor . Leaders social media comments on global issues should be so crafted that they do not raise doubts about basic policy positions . The problem is that while sometimes these social media comments are innocuous , on other occasions they give rise to confusion , especially in the case of complex issues with long histories . It is , therefore , essential that those who manage the social media accounts of the top leadership are aware of the complexities of foreign policymaking and the need for nuanced diplomatic comments . The October 7 Hamas attack threw Israel intelligence and military establishment into complete confusion for many hours . The New York Times , which has always had deep access in the Israeli governmental system , noted in a report : The speed , precision and scale of the Hamas attack had thrown the Israeli military into disarray The report stated that Hamas fighters overwhelmed eight Israeli military bases . They also neutralised an intelligence centre near Gaza , thereby compromising the army communications and surveillance systems . The terror attack killed Israelis , including 286 military personnel . This number included those who fought the Hamas fighters . Around 150 Israelis and people of other nationalities were abducted and taken to Gaza by Hamas . With communications down amid the confusion caused by an unprecedented attack , the Israeli authorities would have come to know the details of the destruction caused by Hamas only by the evening of October 7 . If this was the situation within Israel , the outside world naturally had an incomplete picture of what was happening . Therefore , when Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on the Hamas attack at pm on October 7 , he and his advisers would have mainly gone by media reports and such information that the Indian embassy in Tel Aviv and India contacts in Israel and elsewhere could have provided . Despite the limited information that would have been available to him , the PM decided to tweet . He expressed shock at the attack and stressed : We stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour . This expression of solidarity was correct because of Hamas savagery . While the tweet was fine as an expression against terrorism , the problem was that its narrow focus and brevity made it difficult for the diplomatic community and analysts to comprehend if it signalled a modified Indian approach to India position on the larger Israel Palestine issue . This was particularly so because unlike some Western countries , India has not designated Hamas as a terrorist organisation . This incomprehension about Indian policy continued because after the tweet , India made no comment on the situation , which was becoming increasingly clear from the morning of October 8 , for the next three days . On October 10 , Modi again tweeted after receiving a phone call from Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu . Modi emphasised : People of India stand firmly with Israel at this difficult hour . India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations . This tweet , too , did not really go beyond Modi first one . The Ministry of External Affairs MEA issued a brief press statement , essentially reproducing the content of the tweet . Thus , the confusion on India stand on the Israel Palestine issue was not removed by the tweet or the statement . If anything , the confusion increased because by October 10 , Israel response to the Hamas attack had led to hundreds of civilian deaths in Gaza . Besides , the Indian statement , unlike those of many Arab and other countries , did not caution against an Israeli response that would cause a humanitarian disaster in Gaza . As India focus was only on Hamas terrorism , questions on India broader policy on the Israel Palestine relations became more urgent after October 10 , but there were no answers from Indian officials . The fact is that once the Prime Minister tweets , it becomes very difficult for diplomats or even ministers to clarify broader policy positions to avoid a dilution of the PM message or intention . In the old Indian diplomatic tradition , statements were made by the MEA . That left space for modifications , clarifications and even reversals without the political leadership , let alone the PM , getting publicly involved . All this ensured that any confusion could be addressed at the diplomatic level and it left the PM to make carefully crafted statements which took all aspects of a situation and Indian interests into account . The broader questions were finally cleared at the media briefing given by the MEA spokesperson on October 12 . He correctly reiterated that the October 7 incident was a terror attack and condemned it , but did not take a position on the designation of Hamas as a terrorist organisation . He said that issue was for the relevant authorities . On the Palestine issue , the spokesperson said : Our policy in this regard is long standing and consistent . India has always advocated the resumption of direct negotiations towards establishing a sovereign , independent state of Palestine , living within secure and recognised borders , side by side at peace with Israel . I think that position remains the same . Significantly , he also said : There is a sic universal obligation , I think , to observe international humanitarian law . It is doubtful if Israel would have been happy with these clarifications . Naturally , they would have been cleared at the highest levels of the government . India has to condemn terrorism and Israel has helped it at critical times . There is , therefore , no doubt that the Israeli relationship is important , but India has very significant interests in West Asia and they can not be ignored . If leaders can not avoid social media comments on global issues , they should be so crafted that they do not raise doubts about basic policy positions even while stressing , as in this case , India strong position on terrorism .

              " 'Project Nawaz could be Pakistan path to redemption Neena Gopal By The Pakistan Muslim League bussed in a huge crowd from its strongholds across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for last Saturday rally at Lahore Minar e Pakistan perhaps to send out the message that jailed archrival Imran Khan was no more than an empty threat . Orchestrated or real , the massive show of strength that marked the October 21 homecoming of Mian Nawaz Sharif can not but go down in history as a turning point in the annals of the increasingly troubled nation . The return ended the three time former Pakistan prime minister four year self imposed exile . It paves the way for Nawaz possible re election as prime minister , if and when courts overturn his disqualification from holding office and extend bail to prevent jail time . The Pakistan army Project Imran , indicted Monday for violating the Official Secrets Act , has long called Project comes to fruition after months of protracted negotiations in Washington , London and Dubai . Given Nawaz emotional connection with his followers , will the return translate into a true political comeback ? For sceptics , there a sense of déjà vu . The homecoming is yet another political merry go round which sees the military locking up one favourite as he falls from grace and freeing another to bend to their will , using corruption charges and the threat of jail as a stick to ensure compliance . But those who diss the elder Sharif for making a backroom deal with the army while in exile can not ignore his anti establishment streak his track record of challenging the military writ not once but thrice . He was first removed from office in 1999 despite being hand picked to supplant the Pakistan People Party Bhuttos . Will his electrifying return see him take a fourth shy at prime ministership and would he be given a free hand this time to run the nuclear armed country ? ADVERTISEMENT One of the factors behind this dramatic break from the past could be the unprecedented level of trust between Big Brother Nawaz and the new army chief , General Syed Asim Munir , who owes his post to the Sharifs . Munir was appointed army chief a day after he was set to retire from office . Imran had axed the general when , as the Inter Services Intelligence chief , Munir had brought the then prime minister attention to his wife Bushra Bibi illegal sale of state gifts in the infamous Toshakhana case . Nawaz and his hand picked army chief have made no bones about the grudge they bear towards Munir predecessor , the former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa . Alongside ISI chief Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed , Bajwa orchestrated outsider Imran rise , Nawaz ouster in 2017 , and the dismissal of Munir as ISI chief in February 2022 .

Neena Gopal Foreign policy analyst Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp The Pakistan Muslim League bussed in a huge crowd from its strongholds across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for last Saturday rally at Lahore Minar e Pakistan perhaps to send out the message that jailed archrival Imran Khan was no more than an empty threat . Orchestrated or real , the massive show of strength that marked the October 21 homecoming of Mian Nawaz Sharif can not but go down in history as a turning point in the annals of the increasingly troubled nation . The return ended the three time former Pakistan prime minister four year self imposed exile . It paves the way for Nawaz possible re election as prime minister , if and when courts overturn his disqualification from holding office and extend bail to prevent jail time . The Pakistan army Project Imran , indicted Monday for violating the Official Secrets Act , has long called Project comes to fruition after months of protracted negotiations in Washington , London and Dubai . Given Nawaz emotional connection with his followers , will the return translate into a true political comeback ? For sceptics , there a sense of déjà vu . The homecoming is yet another political merry go round which sees the military locking up one favourite as he falls from grace and freeing another to bend to their will , using corruption charges and the threat of jail as a stick to ensure compliance . But those who diss the elder Sharif for making a backroom deal with the army while in exile can not ignore his anti establishment streak his track record of challenging the military writ not once but thrice . He was first removed from office in 1999 despite being hand picked to supplant the Pakistan People Party Bhuttos . Will his electrifying return see him take a fourth shy at prime ministership and would he be given a free hand this time to run the nuclear armed gpt 9 \" ; ; One of the factors behind this dramatic break from the past could be the unprecedented level of trust between Big Brother Nawaz and the new army chief , General Syed Asim Munir , who owes his post to the Sharifs . Munir was appointed army chief a day after he was set to retire from office . Imran had axed the general when , as the Inter Services Intelligence chief , Munir had brought the then prime minister attention to his wife Bushra Bibi illegal sale of state gifts in the infamous Toshakhana case . Nawaz and his hand picked army chief have made no bones about the grudge they bear towards Munir predecessor , the former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa . Alongside ISI chief Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed , Bajwa orchestrated outsider Imran rise , Nawaz ouster in 2017 , and the dismissal of Munir as ISI chief in February 2022 .

              " 'Palestinians plead stop the bombs at UN meeting but Israel insists Hamas must be obliterated : \" Stop the bombs and save lives ! \" the Palestinian ambassador pleaded at an emotional UN meeting Thursday on the war in . But envoy was adamant , declaring again , \" We will not rest until is obliterated . \" The war sparked by Gaza Hamas rulers surprise attacks on Israel on Oct 7 played out in the vast hall of the 193 nation General Assembly , where Arab nations expected to adopt a resolution Friday calling for an immediate cease fire in Gaza after the Security Council four failed attempts to agree on any action . At the assembly resumed emergency special session on Israeli actions in the Palestinian territories Thursday , speaker after speaker backed the Arab resolution cease fire call except for Israel UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan , who told the 193 member world body , \" A cease fire means giving Hamas time to rearm itself , so they can massacre us again . \" After quoting several Hamas statements vowing to destroy Israel and the Jews , he said , \" Any call for a cease fire is not an attempt at peace . It is an attempt to tie Israel hands , preventing us from eliminating a huge threat to our citizens . \" But the calls for a cease fire , the protection of Palestinian civilians facing constant Israeli bombardments in Gaza and the delivery of desperately needed food , water , medicine and fuel were often passionate and intense from nearly a dozen countries that spoke Thursday . While the Hamas attacks killed some Israelis , more than Palestinians have been killed in Israel retaliatory airstrikes , according to the Gaza Health Ministry . On another key issue the more than 220 hostages taken from Israel Iran foreign minister said Hamas is ready to release civilian prisoners to the Islamic Republic , and he said the international community must take responsibility for releasing Palestinian prisoners held in Israel . Iran \" stands ready to play its part in this very important humanitarian endeavor , along with Qatar and Turkey , \" Hossein Amirabdollahian told the assembly . Iran is a key backer of Hamas and Qatar has already played a key role in the release of four Israeli civilians . Israel Erdan said the country action has nothing to do with the Arab Israeli conflict or the Palestinian question . \" This is not a war with the Palestinians . Israel is at war with the genocidal Jihadist Hamas terror organization , \" he said . But Riyad Mansour , the Palestinian ambassador , said 70 of those killed in Gaza were children and women . \" Is this the war some of you are defending ? Can this war be defended ? These are crimes . This is barbarism , \" he said . \" If you do not stop it for all those who were killed , stop it for all those whose lives we can still save , \" he said . The anguish over the deaths on both sides was palpable . Mansour voice cracked when he spoke of a Palestinian girl killed before the birthday her father had planned and a man hugging the body of his dead mother and saying : \" Come back , and I will take you wherever you want . \" Erdan voice rose when he told the assembly of Hamas fighters firing blindly at hundreds of young people at a concert in southern Israel , parading naked girls that they had raped , and crushing the skulls of babies . He showed a brief video of a badly injured agricultural worker from Thailand being decapitated \" with a blunt gardening tool . \" Jordan Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi , speaking on behalf of the 22 nation Arab Group , spoke emotionally of children dying under the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli precision bombs , and some still alive and trapped with no equipment to pull them out . \" The parents can still hear them . They talk to them helplessly , knowing that they are running out of air and are slowly dying , \" he said . In a sharp rebuke to the Israeli ambassador , he told the assembly , \" I do have videos to show you . We respect the dead too much . We respect the pain of their families too much to show videos . \" Safadi also criticized Erdan for not saying a word \" about Palestinian lives shattered in this war . \" \" Do let them tell you this is a war between Muslims and Jews , \" he said . \" We value life , Muslim life , Christian life , Jewish life . \" He was interrupted with applause when he then said , \" We care about all lives . Do let them tell you otherwise . \" The Jordanian minister also told Israel that it can not remain above international law requiring protection of civilians , hospitals , schools , homes and other infrastructure . \" The right to self defense is not a license to kill with impunity , \" he stressed . Safadi also criticized the United States and its allies without naming them . \" Many among us believe that they are helping Israel by supporting its war , \" he said . \" They are not . Instead of sending weapons to Israel , send delegations to open an immediate and viable path to peace . This is how they can help Israel . \" Iran Amirabdollahian accused the United States of directly participating in the war and what he called a \" genocide \" against the Palestinians . \" The genocide in Gaza must stop immediately , \" he said . He warned against \" the uncontrollable consequences of the unlimited financial , arms and operational support by the White House to the Tel Aviv regime \" which has added to the severe bombardments and killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza . The emergency General Assembly meeting resumes Friday morning , with about 100 speakers remaining . The resolution that Mansour said will be put to a vote on Friday afternoon calls for an immediate cease fire and demands that all parties respect international law and protect civilians . It says that essential goods including food , water and medicine should be provided in the Gaza Strip . It also calls for Israel to rescind its order for Gazans to move from the north to the south , for maximum restraint and for the release of all civilians . Unlike the Security Council , there are no vetoes in the General Assembly and its resolutions are not legally binding . But they do reflect world opinion and the size of the vote in favor will be closely watched . The Palestinians have wide support , but Israel Erdan called the resolution \" a disgrace \" for not even mentioning Hamas and urged countries to oppose it .',\n",
              " 'Granting Visa To Iranian FM Sparks Strong Criticism In The US The decision to grant a visa to the Iranian foreign minister to attend the emergency meeting of the UNGA has ignited fierce criticism in the United States . Joni Ernst , a Republican Senator , took to X to express her concern , stating , \" While Iran backed terrorists have attacked our servicemembers and are currently holding Americans hostage , the Biden administration has granted a top Iranian official a visa welcoming this regime on US soil with open arms . The appeasement must end . \" FM Hossein Amir Abdollahian is visiting New York to take part in the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly , scheduled for Thursday , to discuss the Israel Palestine conflict . He is set to speak following representatives from Palestine , Israel , and Jordan . Jason Brodsky , the Policy Director at United Against Nuclear Iran , raised serious reservations about the visa issuance , pointing out that the Iranian foreign minister had participated in planning meetings for the recent Hamas attack on Israel . Brodsky also noted that there is an exception in the US UN Host Agreement that allows for the denial of entry to foreign officials for UN meetings in cases of security , terrorism , and foreign policy concerns . He argued that this exception should have been invoked in Amir Abdollahian case . Former State Department advisor on Iran , Gabriel Noronha , also criticized the visa decision . He questioned the rationale behind granting a visa to the foreign minister of a country that has been accused of funding Hamas , which has targeted and killed Americans . Noronha highlighted that the US has the legal right to block the entry of such individuals , citing precedents like the denial of entry to Yasser Arafat and Javad Zarif in the past .',\n",

              " 'Eying Gaza mediator role , Turkey cools Hamas ties , Erdogan restrains rhetoric October 22 , 2023 Turkey has been trying to carefully calibrate its stance in the face of the war that Hamas launched against Israel on 7 , maintaining its advocacy of the Palestinian cause while cooling ties with Hamas and seeking to avoid a fresh fallout with Israel . The crisis hit at a time when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is pursuing normalization with regional powers including Israel . After years of bilateral spats , Erdogan met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York last month and invited him to visit Ankara . At first glance , one could suggest that the Erdogan government close relations with Hamas have now driven it into a corner . Moreover , one could expect growing US pressure on Ankara to sever ties with Hamas after the dust settles . Nevertheless , for the West , Turkey at present represents a partner who can talk to Hamas , and this serves as a sort of lightning rod for Erdogan government . The calls made to Ankara requesting its mediation for the release of foreign hostages held by Hamas have given Erdogan the opportunity to play the role he was hoping for . Unlike his vitriolic outbursts against Israel in the past , Erdogan has restrained his language this time , careful not to jeopardize the new chapter that he had just opened with Israel . He may have toughened his tone against Israel a bit over the mounting casualties in Gaza , but he has withheld the support that would please Hamas . Dissatisfaction with Turkey Acknowledging the disappointment on the Palestinian side , a Palestinian source in Ankara told Al Monitor , The Palestinian groups , including Hamas , have been dissatisfied with Turkey stance . Its statements are viewed as inadequate . They did not even summon the Israeli ambassador to the Foreign Ministry . Hamas political head Ismail Haniyeh , who lives in voluntary exile in Qatar and Turkey , was in Istanbul when Hamas breached the Israeli walls . Haniyeh was politely sent away after footage circulated on social media showing him and other Hamas members prostrating themselves in a prayer of gratitude while watching news of the incursion on television , two different sources told Al Monitor . Ankara was annoyed also by remarks that Saleh al Arouri , Haniyeh deputy , made to Al Jazeera that day . Arouri bragged that Hamas had captured enough Israeli soldiers to force Israel to free all Palestinian prisoners in its jails and would continue to fight . According to the two sources , Ankara politely asked Haniyeh and his entourage to leave Turkey , unwilling to appear to be protecting Hamas after the group killing of Israeli civilians . On Monday , a Turkish official denied claims that the government had ordered Haniyeh and the other senior officials to leave Turkey . In an interview with Turkey Haberturk TV last week , Khaled Meshaal , another senior Hamas figure , implied that the group expected stronger support from Ankara . I have great respect for Turkey . Turkey should say stop to Israel , he said . Still , Ankara may not be seeing the current cooling of ties as irreversible , and Hamas leaders may not make an issue of it in the hope that Turkey door remains open to them . However , Ankara is unlikely to toughen its stance on Hamas as much as its Western partners would like . Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan seemed to preclude a drastic shift in Ankara position when he underlined Tuesday that the perspectives of the West and Turkey differ . \" Since the Westerners define Hamas as a terrorist organization , they appraise all its activities in the framework of terrorism . We , for our part , say that no party should target civilians , he said . At the behest of Erdogan , Turkish intelligence and Foreign Ministry officials have held contacts with Hamas but have allegedly failed to get a positive response to mediation offers . Some seem to take this as a sign that Ankara lacks influence , but in the initial stage of the conflict , Hamas has not been open to proposals from Qatar and Egypt either . According to the Palestinian source , the pressure on Ankara to cut ties with Hamas is coming mostly from the United States rather than Israel . As for the mediation efforts , the source said that Hamas , Islamic Jihad and other resistance groups in Gaza are unwilling to discuss any mediation at present . All proposals have called for the release of the hostages in return for halting Israeli air raids , the resumption of water and power supplies to Gaza , and the opening of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt but the groups in Gaza insist that the bombings should stop before any discussions can take place , the source explained . If the parties become ready for a cease fire , Egypt would not leave the mediation to anyone . Qatar and Turkey could play side roles , he added . A source close to the Turkish government said the contacts with Hamas had shifted mostly to Qatar , with Egypt retaining its traditional role , while Turkey was more active in contacts with Iran and Lebanon in a bid to prevent the risk of Hezbollah opening a new front in the conflict . The source acknowledged a cooling in Ankara ties with Hamas , even though contacts continued . Turkey president and foreign minister have spoken with their Iranian counterparts over the phone , and Fidan held talks in Lebanon on Tuesday . Erdogan discussed Gaza in a phone call with the leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas , Ismail Haniyeh , on Saturday , Reuters reported . Erdogan told Haniyeh about Ankara efforts for a ceasefire , for humanitarian aid to reach Gaza and possible treatment of the wounded in Turkey . Restrain and caution As in previous Palestinian Israeli conflicts , Egypt , which ruled Gaza for nearly two decades after the creation of Israel in 1948 and continues to control the Rafah crossing , is seen as the actor that is the likeliest to set up a negotiating table , while Turkey role remains limited . Egypt has kept its distance from Hamas , being an enemy of the Muslim Brotherhood , and wields more influence over Palestinian groups in general as it is seen as a more reliable mediator by Israel . Regardless of what Ankara mediation efforts achieve , they increase Erdogan regional activism . Whenever Turkey has raised its diplomatic profile , as in the war against Ukraine and the grain corridor crisis , Erdogan has skillfully used that to project an image as a sought after leader in the international arena . Fidan efforts , including phone calls with numerous counterparts and visits to Cairo and Beirut , seem to focus on the release of the hostages , the prevention of a deeper humanitarian crisis and the regionalization of the conflict , and the revival of the two state solution process . Speaking to journalists earlier this week , he said Ankara was proposing a system of guarantors in an eventual Israeli Palestinian settlement , with Turkey among the guarantors of the Palestinian side . The restraint and caution marking the Erdogan government new stance could be attributed to several factors . First , the usage value of the Palestinian cause in domestic politics has been decreasing . With the conflicts in Syria and Iraq , popular sentiment against Islamist groups has grown , eroding tolerance for the use of violence by Palestinian groups . Second , the energy equilibrium in the Eastern Mediterranean dictates good relations with Israel . Turkey interventionist posture in Arab countries was a major factor behind the deterioration of its ties with Gulf heavyweights . Erdogan reconciliation drive in the past couple of years has been underlain by big economic interests , and he now feels the need to step on the brakes on the Palestinian issue . Third , the strategic decision to mend fences also with the United States and the European Union requires Turkey to readjust its posture in the Middle East . Whether it can pull it off this time remains unclear , but Ankara has learned well from the Ukraine war that it makes gains by playing the role of a mediator . Update : 23 , 2023 . This article has been updated since its initial publication to include a statement from a Turkish official .',\n",

              " 'Stop American weapons from killing civilians in Gaza Following Hamas atrocities in Israel earlier this month , the Israeli government mounted a counteroffensive in which it reportedly dropped bombs on Gaza an area about double the size of Washington , , with triple the population in the first several days . Many aspects of the Israeli campaign raise serious international law concerns . Regardless of Hamas war crimes , the Israeli government is bound to comply with the law of armed conflict . As the leading provider of weapons and military aid to Israel , the United States bears special responsibility for international law violations and harm to civilians . Investigators and legal experts at leading human rights organizations claim that the Israeli government has used white phosphorus in Gaza , and one organization found that it did so in ways that violate international law . White phosphorus munitions are used as smokescreens , target markers , and incendiary weapons that burn at nearly 1500 degrees Fahrenheit when exposed to the air . Water does not extinguish white phosphorus , and severe burns on just a tenth of a person body are often fatal . Survivors of severe burns , respiratory damage , and organ failure are often left with injuries and chronic conditions that can last a lifetime . Human Rights Watch concludes that using white phosphorus in densely populated areas of Gaza violates international humanitarian law , also known as the law of armed conflict . Similarly , Amnesty International researchers found compelling evidence of the Israeli military using white phosphorus in densely populated civilian areas in Gaza , many of which may be considered unlawful indiscriminate attacks . The Israeli government has denied that it used white phosphorus . Both human rights groups provide extensive information about their research standards and investigation processes . In its investigation , Amnesty International said it identified Department of Defense codes on Israel phosphorus based munitions . The munitions may have been exported from the United States . Israel military has faced claims it used American white phosphorus before . In 2009 , Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International claims to have identified that Israel used white phosphorus munitions made in Louisiana and Arkansas during the Gaza war . After Israeli rights groups sued , the Israeli military announced plans to significantly reduce its usage of white phosphorus munitions in urban areas . Although white phosphorus provides a specific example of possible complicity in violations , it is far from the only measure in the war that international law experts have identified as violations or possible atrocity crimes . Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant ordered a siege on Gaza with no electricity , no food , no fuel , an order that experts have identified as a war crime and potential crime against humanity . According to a UN special rapporteur and leading human rights and humanitarian organizations , Israel order for million people in Gaza to evacuate the northern half of the territory within 24 hours also violated international humanitarian law . In a rare public determination , the International Committee of the Red Cross called the order not compatible with international humanitarian law . A group of over 45 UN special rapporteurs condemned Israel indiscriminate military attacks in Gaza , noting that indiscriminately targeting civilians is a war crime . While debates among lawyers will doubtlessly continue , the human cost of the Israeli offensive is irrefutable : Gaza health ministry reports that Israeli strikes have killed at least people , including children . Families on both sides of the border mourn loved ones and fear for their safety as Hamas attacks killed over people . Each year , the United States provides billion in military aid to Israel annually , making it the top recipient of foreign military financing . The United States has already begun sending weapons to Israel for use in its offensive , with small diameter bombs , artillery shells , ammunition , and other weapons already delivered or on the way . Explosive weapons pose an especially high risk to civilians in urban areas . The State Department recently developed guidance to respond to reports of harm to civilians involving weapons . Many civilian deaths and damage to civilian infrastructure likely involve weapons from the United States , meaning that the war in Gaza may present the first major test of the guidance reported in September . But despite the guidance and reports of international law violations , the United States has not placed any conditions on arms transfers to Israel . Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said , we would hope and expect that they would do the right things in the prosecution of their campaign . Unconditional support could expose officials to international legal liability for aiding and abetting war crimes , a State Department concern during support for Saudi led coalition airstrikes in Yemen . The International Criminal Court already has an open investigation that covers violations in Gaza . The cornerstone law on security assistance and human rights as currently implemented is probably not being applied to Israeli violations in Gaza . The Leahy Law , which prohibits security assistance to units of foreign security forces credibly accused of gross violations of human rights , has historically not been implemented for the vast majority of US military assistance to Israel . And the government generally interprets the Leahy Law as inapplicable to wartime violations of the law of armed conflict . Based on public statements and policy implementation , the Biden administration does not appear to be conducting due diligence to ensure that military assistance and weapons do not contribute to international humanitarian law violations and atrocities . The Biden administration should do all it can to protect civilians in Gaza and Israel . But in light of the Biden administration reluctance to push the Israeli military to protect civilian lives , Congress must step in . First and foremost , members of Congress should call for a ceasefire to save civilian lives and pressure the administration to prioritize humanitarian access . A new resolution led by Reps . Cori Bush D and Rashida Tlaib D does just that . Regarding weapons and other security assistance , legislators must push for President Biden to use leverage to advocate for a ceasefire and insist that the Israeli military take all feasible precautions to prevent harm to civilians . In line with the Biden administration arms transfer policy which a recently resigned State Department official accused the administration of violating the United States must not provide the Israeli government with weapons likely to be used in atrocities , based on both current practices and past violations .

              " '900 US Troops Deployed Or Being Deployed In Middle East Amid Israel Hamas War : Report New Delhi : As the Israel Hamas war continues , the US has deployed or is deploying about 900 troops to the Middle East , Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Pat Ryder said on Thursday local time , CNN reported .

They locked themselves in a library while the crowd pounded on the door . On Wednesday afternoon , ugly scenes occurred at Cooper Union , a liberal institution in Manhattan close to Astor Place . The mob first gathered in the building foyer , screaming Free , free Palestine . However , they pushed through a security guard , who angrily exclaimed , No !

              " 'EU leaders attempt unity on Gaza crisis , may call for pauses in war to let aid in Amid the ongoing Israel Hamas and Ukraine Russia war , European Unions leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday . Calling for unity on the Israel Gaza situation , the leaders are considering an amended text on the issue . \" The European Council reiterates the importance of ensuring the protection of all civilians at all times in line with international humanitarian law . It deplores all loss of civilian life , \" the text was quoted by The Guardian . The European Council expresses its gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and calls for continued , rapid , safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs , it added . Addressing the EU 27 leaders , European parliament president Roberta Metsola said \" there can be no excuses \" for Hamas attack on Israel . Just as it is important to understand that Hamas do not represent the legitimate aims of the Palestinian people . They hinder them , she added . \" As a Parliament we have always and will always keep insisting on respect for international law , that the humanitarian consequences of stopping Hamas must be a priority and that aid must be able to reach the innocent people in need , \" she said . \" As a Union , we have a responsibility to remain coherent and united . To do this is not to condone more death and violence but to avoid a dangerous regional escalation of the conflict . We must leave even a sliver of possibility that peace can ultimately be found , \" she added . Latvia Prime Minister Evika Silina stressed that the bloc needs to be united on both Ukraine and the Middle East . Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala proposed the leadership to \" support Israel as much as possible at European level \" . \" I will emphasise that we must not forget who is the originator of the terror and who started this war , \" he said . Meanwhile , Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan criticised EU position on Middle East crisis . \" How many more children must die before the EU Commission can call for a ceasefire ? How many more tons of bombs must fall on Gaza for the UNSC to take action ? he said .',\n",
              " 'Iran ayatollahs play the Middle East most dangerous game The warning signs that Israel war with Hamas may become a wider Middle East conflagration are flashing ominously . America has sent a second carrier strike group led by the USS Eisenhower to the Persian Gulf . There a likelihood of escalation , \" said Antony Blinken , the American secretary of state , on October . The chances of further attacks by Iranian proxies on American forces are growing , he continued : We do want to see a second or third front develop . \" Fears are also growing in Lebanon that Israel could use America cover to launch a pre emptive strike . Israel has evacuated its towns near the border with Lebanon and Binyamin Netanyahu , Israel prime minister , has cautioned that if Hizbullah , an Iran backed militia in Lebanon , enters the fighting , the consequences for Lebanon will be devastating . One reason Israel has delayed its offensive in Gaza may be to bolster its preparations for escalation on its northern front . Iran foreign minister has said the region is like a powder keg \" . Iran autocratic rulers hold one of the matches that could set it alight : an axis of resistance \" , or network of violent proxies across the region . They have spent two decades building this up in Iraq , Lebanon , Syria and Yemen . Iran preys on places where the local polity is weak , where it is easy to funnel in personnel and weapons and where no external actor can challenge it , according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies , a think tank based in London . Iran ability to cause mayhem at arm length through Hamas , Hizbullah , Iraq plethora of Shia militias and Yemen Houthis may even give it more leverage than its conventional military capabilities , which are relatively weak . Iran goal right now , as it has been over the past decade , is not to provoke outright war with the West and its allies but to sow uncertainty and instability . Just as it has hovered on the threshold of becoming a nuclear power , so it maintains strategic ambiguity with the axis . It denies it is in charge while supplying armed groups like the Houthis with arms , giving them training and using them as fronts to conduct attacks , such as a missile strike on Saudi Aramco in 2019 which temporarily shuttered 5 of global oil production . The purpose is to intimidate while complicating the West calculus . That strategy pleases Iran ever closer friend , Russia . Similarly isolated from the West , it engages in weapons trade and sanctions busting with the Islamic republic : think of Iranian designed kamikaze drones killing Ukrainians . The present crisis shows the opportunities and problems of Iran approach . It has long sponsored Hamas but did not appear to know in advance about its attack on Israel on October , according to Western officials familiar with the matter . Yet it has sought to capitalise on Hamas atrocities and mobilise the axis of resistance . Hizbullah and Israel have exchanged fire , with the explicit support of Iran and America , respectively . As many as 19 of Hizbullah fighters have been killed . The Houthis , who control Yemen capital , have launched three medium range cruise missiles , recently acquired from Iran , and a number of drones towards Eilat , Israel port city they were intercepted by an American destroyer . And Iranian backed Shia militias in Syria and Iraq have broadened the struggle by repeatedly targeting bases housing American troops with rockets and drones America has drawn down its diplomatic presence in Iraq as a result . View Full Image Graphic : The Economist For Iran , there are some obvious benefits . The conflagration in Gaza has halted even if only temporarily talks on normalising relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia . Any such agreement would mark a further step in the Abraham accords through which Bahrain , Morocco , Sudan and the United Arab Emirates have since 2020 established diplomatic ties with Israel . Iran Shia ayatollahs can not stand the idea of being isolated as Sunni led Muslim states and Israel co operate more . A push to delegitimise the Abraham accords continues : at a meeting of Muslim foreign ministers in Saudi Arabia on October , Iran called on Muslim countries to impose an oil embargo on Israel . The Iranian regime is backing calls to push Egypt to take in Palestinians from Gaza , perhaps in the hope of aggravating tensions between Israel and its oldest Arab ally . Regional turmoil also means more cash for Iran , at least for now . Oil prices have climbed by over 5 per barrel since October . America is anxious to tamp down inflation in the run up to its election next year and has been tacitly allowing Iran to export more oil , despite formally retaining sanctions . Those Iranian barrels are very important \" to Joe Biden , says Ahmed Mehdi , a London based oil analyst . Production has topped 3 m barrels per day , its highest levels since the Trump administration imposed sanctions in 2018 . Year on year , Mr Mehdi says , exports are up by over a third . Yet the escalating proxy war with America and its friends comes with big risks for Iran . At home officials crow that they have become statesmen \" again , with president Ebrahim Raisi viewed by many in the West as a hardline pariah speaking to the French president , Emmanuel Macron , in recent days . Ordinary Iranians are less impressed . A regional war could prompt a new cycle of protests at home . Armita Geravand , an Iranian schoolgirl who collapsed on October after a beating from the morality police , according to local activists , has been declared brain dead news that could revive the outrage that brought Iranian protesters into the streets in 2022 after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini , detained for improperly \" wearing the mandatory veil . Iranians are exhausted by their regime adventures abroad and reluctant to endure more suffering for Palestine . Government organised protests have been sparsely attended . A minute silence at a football match in Tehran for those killed in Gaza was interrupted by raucous guffaws . Neither Gaza nor Lebanon , \" protesters chanted from their windows . We sacrifice our lives for Iran . \" Iran shadow war is a delicate game and it is not clear that the country can control its proxies . Since America assassination of Qassem Suleimani , one of the masterminds behind the axis of resistance , three years ago , Iran satellites have increased their autonomy . As they hurl threats of war along with their rockets , they may find it hard to step back from their rhetoric . Each has set red lines \" for intervention against Israel and the West . A failure to respond could puncture their credibility with local supporters . An Israeli ground invasion of Gaza could force their hand . The proxies must also balance their military aspirations with the interests of their host countries . According to Iranian officials , Bashar al Assad , the Syrian president , has told Hizbullah he has no desire to heed its calls to attack Israel from his territory . In his view , Hamas betrayed him by siding with the rebellion against him in 2011 after he gave them sanctuary . He does not want to fight for them now . Lebanon fears being another sacrificial pawn . Its Shias are the country largest sect , but its other 17 official denominations form a majority . Tellingly , Hassan Nasrallah , Hizbullah leader famed for his belligerent speeches , has shied from addressing his public from his bunker in Beirut since the fighting began . The threat of war has kiboshed Lebanon hopes of a tourism revival . Lloyd , an insurance firm , has signalled it could withdraw cover , and Middle East Airlines , Lebanon national carrier , is docking some of its fleet in Turkey . America has told its citizens to leave . The Lebanese prime minister has said the decision regarding war and peace \" is out of his hands . If Iran proxies attack American interests , or possibly Israel , it is most likely that America retaliates against them , rather than their sponsor Iran , in the first instance . Still , that is a high stakes gamble . And in the long run Iran decision to mobilise the axis of resistance signals it is heading towards isolation and autocracy . Only a month ago , the regime was celebrating a prisoner exchange with America and the imminent transfer to Iran of of frozen oil revenues . Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had blessed direct talks for the first time since the Trump administration withdrew from a nuclear deal . Some spoke of a new detente . Now that lies in tatters and the chances of a catastrophic wider war , while still low , are far too high for comfort . 2023 , The Economist Newspaper Limited . All rights reserved .

              " 'US carries out strikes against Iranian targets in Syria : Pentagon WASHINGTON : The US military on Thursday carried out strikes against two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and groups it backs , the Pentagon said , in response to a spate of attacks against US forces in both Iraq and Syria . As tensions soar over the Israel Hamas conflict , US and coalition troops have been attacked at least 12 times in Iraq and four times in Syria by Iran backed forces . A total of 21 US forces have suffered minor injuries , the vast majority of them traumatic brain injuries . \" These precision self defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against US personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups that began on October 17 , \" US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement . The strikes were ordered by President Joe Biden . \" These Iranian backed attacks against US forces are unacceptable and must stop , \" Austin said in the statement . \" If attacks by Iran proxies against US forces continue , we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people . \" The United States has occasionally carried out retaliatory strikes against Iranian backed forces in the region after they attack American forces . In March , the US military carried out multiple air strikes in Syria against Iran aligned groups that it blamed for a drone attack that killed an American contractor . President Biden has sent a rare message to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning Tehran against targeting US personnel in the Middle East , the White House said earlier on Thursday . The United States has 900 troops in Syria , and more in neighboring Iraq , on a mission to advise and assist local forces trying to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State , which in 2014 seized large swathes of both countries but was later defeated . There is growing concern that the Israel Hamas conflict could spread through the Middle East and turn US troops at isolated bases into targets . Last week off the coast of Yemen , a US warship shot down more than a dozen drones and four cruise missiles fired by Iranian backed Houthis . During a false alarm at Al Asad air base in Iraq last week , a civilian contractor died from cardiac arrest . The United States has sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region since the Israel Hamas conflict erupted on October 7 , including two aircraft carriers , to try to deter Iran and Iran backed groups . The number of troops added to the region is in the thousands . Reuters reported this week the US military was taking new measures to protect its Middle East forces during the ramp up in attacks by suspected Iran backed groups , and was leaving open the possibility of evacuating military families if needed . The measures include increasing US military patrols , restricting access to base facilities and boosting intelligence collection , including through drone and other surveillance operations , officials say .',\n",

Amid the attacks , it has been announced by a Palestinian spokesperson that there has been a total collapse of the health system in Gaza . By Ananya Srivastava Advertisement Gaza Strip Medical System Collapses Totally New Delhi : Israel and Palestine have been at opposite ends of diplomatic relations for decades and the conflict between the two nations has been going on for a very long time . On October 7 , Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel , firing thousands of rockets and sending its forces into Israeli territory , to which Israel responded with massive airstrikes and punitive measures , including a siege on the enclave with supplies of water , electricity , fuel , and other necessities being cut off . The ongoing Israel Hamas conflict has so far killed nearly Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and more than people in Israel . As always , the war has had and continues to have devastating effects with loss of life and property ; with continuous attacks , both Gaza and Israel have their complaints and issues . According to a Palestinian spokesperson , the medical system in the Gaza Strip has collapsed completely . Total Collapse Of Medical System In Gaza : Palestinian Spokesperson A Palestinian spokesman has announced the total collapse of the health system in the Gaza Strip due to power outage and the exhaustion of fuel needed to operate generators in hospitals . Ashraf Al Qudra , spokesman for the Gaza based Health Ministry , told a press conference on Tuesday that Israeli attacks had so far killed 65 medical staff , destroyed 25 ambulances , and made 12 hospitals and 32 health centres in the Palestinian enclave inoperable , Xinhua news agency reported . We fear that more hospitals and health centres will be out of service in the coming hours due to the attacks and running out of fuel , said the spokesman . Advertisement Fuel Shortage In Hospitals May Kill Newborn Babies It was reported a few days ago that many newborn premature babies are at risk due to the fuel shortage in the hospitals in the Gaza Strip . The responsibility on us is huge , Iyad Abu Zahar , Hospital Director of Al Aqsa Hospital said . Doctors treating premature babies across Gaza are grappling with similar fears . At least 130 premature babies are at grave risk across six neonatal units , aid workers said . The dangerous fuel shortages are caused by the Israeli blockade of Gaza , which started along with airstrikes after Hamas militants attacked Israeli towns on October 7 . At least pregnant women in Gaza are unable to access essential health services , and some are due to give birth in the coming month , according to the World Health Organisation . Trending Now If the generator stops , which we are expecting in the coming few hours due to the heavy demands of different departments in the hospital , the incubators in the intensive care unit will be in a very critical situation , he said .

It a real emergency to take care of these babies , as it is an emergency to take care of the population of Gaza who are suffering from these bombings since the past two weeks .

              " 'Israel expects long ground war in Gaza to destroy Hamas and its many tunnels DEIR AL BALAH , Gaza Strip AP Israel expects to launch a long and difficult ground offensive into Gaza soon to destroy Hamas , the country defense minister said Friday , describing a campaign that will require dismantling a vast network of tunnels used by the territory militant rulers . Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke to a small group of foreign reporters in Tel Aviv after Israeli forces backed by fighter jets and drones carried out a second , limited ground raid into Gaza in as many days , striking the outskirts of Gaza City . Gallant said the ground invasion that follows weeks of airstrikes will take a long time , and that it would lead to another lengthy phase of lower intensity fighting , as Israel destroys pockets of resistance . In a sign of rising tensions in the region , warplanes struck targets in eastern Syria that the Pentagon said were linked to Iran Revolutionary Guard after a string of attacks on American forces , and two mysterious objects hit towns in Egypt Sinai Peninsula . After three weeks of war sparked by a bloody Hamas incursion into southern Israel , the Palestinian death toll has soared past , according to officials in Gaza . A blockade on Gaza has meant dwindling supplies of food , fuel , water and medicine , and and Arab leaders have called for a cease fire to allow entry of humanitarian aid that is only trickling in . Gaza Health Ministry on Thursday released a detailed list of names and identification numbers of those killed , including more than minors and more than women . ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement More than people were slain in Israel during Hamas 7 attack , according to the Israeli government , and at least 229 hostages were taken into Gaza . Palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel , including one that hit a residential building in Tel Aviv on Friday , wounding four people . The overall number of deaths far exceeds the combined toll of all four previous wars between Israel and Hamas , estimated at around . A ground invasion is expected to cause even higher casualties on both sides as Israeli forces and Hamas battle each other in dense residential areas . Hospitals have been scrounging for fuel to run emergency generators that power incubators and other life saving equipment after Israel cut off all fuel deliveries to Gaza at the start of the war , forcing its only power plant to shut down . Gallant said Israel believes that Hamas would confiscate any fuel that enters . He said Hamas uses generators to pump air into its hundreds of kilometers miles of tunnels , which originate in civilian areas . He showed reporters aerial footage of what he said was a tunnel shaft built right next to a hospital . ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement For air , they need oil . For oil , they need us , he said . Little is known about Hamas secretive tunnels and other infrastructure , and it was possible to independently confirm Gallant claims . Lynne Hastings , the aid coordinator for the Palestinian territories , declined to comment on Gallant remarks , saying we do know what Hamas has or does have . We have been bringing fuel into Gaza in coordination with the government of Israel for decades . We know fuel is a high risk item and are working with the Israelis to make sure what we will be using for our operations is done securely , she said . ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement The agency for Palestinian refugees , which provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza , said it has been forced to ration fuel among lifesaving machines in hospitals , bakeries , and desalination plants , and only has enough for a few more days . The siege means that food , water and fuel basic commodities are being used to collectively punish more than 2 million people , among them , a majority of children and women , Philippe Lazzarini , the head of UNRWA , told reporters . Earlier on Friday , the military said ground forces raided inside Gaza , striking dozens of militant targets over the past 24 hours . It said aircraft and artillery bombed targets in Shijaiyah , a neighborhood on Gaza City outskirts that was the scene of an urban battle in the 2014 Gaza war . The military said the soldiers exited the territory without suffering any casualties . It reported an earlier , hourslong raid into northern Gaza on Thursday . ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement The damage to Gaza from nearly three weeks of bombardment showed in satellite photos of several locations taken before the war and again in recent days . Entire rows of residential buildings simply disappear in the photos , reduced to smears of dust and rubble . The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses Hamas of operating among civilians in an attempt to protect its fighters . The conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region . Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that the Friday strikes in eastern Syria were a response to ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against personnel in Iraq and Syria over the past 10 days . He said the operation was separate from the Israel Hamas war . ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement Hezbollah , an Iranian backed ally of Hamas in Lebanon , has repeatedly traded fire with Israel along the border , and Israel has carried out airstrikes targeting Iran linked groups in Syria . The United States has sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region , along with additional weaponry and personnel , in part to deter Iran and its allies from entering the war . Egypt military meanwhile said a drone crashed into a building in the Red Sea town of Taba , on the border with Israel , slightly wounding six people . In a separate incident , the state run Al Qahera news said a strange object landed near a power station in the Red Sea town of Nuweiba , further south . Footage showed debris and smoke rising from the side of a nearby mountain . Last week , a Navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched toward Israel by Iran backed Houthi rebels in northern Yemen . About million of Gaza million residents have fled their homes , with nearly half of them crowding into shelters . Hundreds of thousands remain in northern Gaza , despite Israel ordering them to evacuate to the south and saying that those who remain might be considered accomplices of Hamas .

But aid workers say the convoys meet only a tiny fraction of the territory mounting humanitarian needs . Before the war , an average of 500 trucks entered Gaza each day , according to the United Nations . The Palestinian Red Crescent said on social media that it had received 10 trucks of food , medicine and other supplies had passed through Rafah on Friday morning . The has been working with other mediators to send in more humanitarian aid , but Israel is insisting on strict screening procedures for all trucks that enter .

Giving out further details , the Israeli military said the battalion operatives played a significant role in the invasion and murderous attack against Israel on October 7 . The operatives were considered the most significant brigade of the Hamas terrorist organisation , the Israeli Defense Forces said . advertisement A post on the official handle of the Israel Defense Forces on X stated , \" IDF fighter jets struck 3 senior Hamas operatives in the Daraj Tuffah Battalion . The battalion operatives played a significant role in the invasion and murderous attack against Israel on October 7 , and is considered to be the most significant brigade of the Hamas terrorist organisation . \" An image released by the Israeli military showed the three slain terrorists . Israeli Defense Forces kill 3 Hamas terrorists \" The Darj Tafah Battalion is a battalion in the Gaza City Brigade , which is considered the most significant brigade of the terrorist organization Hamas . The battalion terrorists took a significant part in the murderous massacre on October 7 , \" the Israeli Air Force added in its post . The force also said the Hamas operatives were eliminated under the precise intelligence guidance of the Israel Security Agency Shin Bet . Earlier on Thursday , the deputy head of Hamas intelligence directorate , Shadi Barud , had been killed in an aerial strike , the Israeli Defense Forces said . According to IDF , he was involved in the planning of Hamas October 7 attack on Israel . ISRAEL RAIDS GAZA On Thursday , Israeli forces carried out their biggest Gaza ground attack in their 20 day old war with Hamas overnight as anger grew in the Arab world over Israel relentless bombardment of the besieged Palestinian territory . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said Israeli troops were still preparing for a full ground invasion , while the US and other countries urged Israel to delay , fearing it could ignite hostilities on other Middle East fronts . The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees , UNRWA , said it may soon have to shut down operations in Gaza if no fuel reaches the Hamas ruled territory amid a desperate need for shelter , water , food and medical services . The Israeli military says Hamas is holding large reserves of fuel which could be used by hospitals .',\n",
              " 'Information wars NEW DELHI : One of the biggest casualties of any armed conflict is the notion of truth . And nowhere has that adage felt truer than in the recent unrest that has transpired in the Middle East , involving Israel and Hamas . The conflict that has now stretched into its third week has turned social media into a melting pot of misinformation , disinformation , and propaganda . Several pages supportive of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza went all out to circulate graphic footage allegedly depicting Hamas atrocities . One such video pertaining to a pregnant woman being assaulted by the terrorists had left netizens shell shocked . Fact checking confirmed that the said video had nothing to do with the Israel Hamas stand off and that it was related to an act of retribution carried out by hitmen in Mexico . Miscreants have also been targeting high profile celebrities , sportspersons and actors , alleging that they have sided with either the Palestinian cause or the Israeli occupation . Representatives of such individuals have in turn taken to social media to refute or clarify their stand on the conflict , considering the potential for off the cuff remarks snowballing into something serious . The international community is taking things lying down . Educational institutions in Israel , as well as Jewish schools in America , have urged parents to delete social media apps such as Instagram , TikTok and X Twitter from their children smartphones to prevent them from witnessing violent footage related to the Israel Hamas conflict . Stakeholders are concerned how Hamas might weaponise social media and flood various apps with footage of Israeli hostages . We have seen how videos of two elderly Israeli women kidnapped by the group had gone viral , with messages attempting to reinforce that the captors were being cordial to them . These videos were juxtaposed alongside footage depicting the ruthless members of the Israel Defense Forces IDF dealing with ordinary Palestinian citizens in the aftermath of the recent conflict . In India , a war of words erupted between the ruling dispensation and the Congress , which had supposedly voiced its support for the Palestinian cause , without taking into account the casualties on the Israeli side . While the BJP termed the development as an episode of the Congress being held hostage to minority vote bank politics , the opposition went on damage control mode , countering it with claims of Atal Bihari Vajpayee espousing the need for political agency for the Palestinians . Needless to say , cyberspace had a field day with numerous iterations of what was said , and what was left unsaid . Interestingly , this week , European Union officials demanded that Meta and TikTok detail their efforts to curb illegal content and disinformation during the Israel Hamas war , while flexing the power of a new law that threatens billions in fines if the tech giants fail to do enough to protect users . These large tech platforms are now subject to content related regulations under the Digital Services Act . It requires them to stop the spread of fake news , while addressing the vicious cycle of engagement driven , algorithmically recommended content read boosting the visibility of posts made by verified blue tick accounts , which can now be purchased for a fee . It would be an understatement to regard the unchecked proliferation of fake news on social media as a risk factor for geopolitical instability in the days to come .',\n",

              " 'Don Bacon backs consensus GOP pick Johnson for House speaker OMAHA Days after he and his family drew threats from Republican populists for resisting Ohio Jim Jordan push to be House Speaker , Don Bacon supported a consensus GOP pick who , like Jordan , voted to reject the 2020 election results . Congressional Republicans unanimously backed Louisiana Mike Johnson on Wednesday to lead the House following three weeks of party infighting over whether Speaker Kevin McCarthy should have lost his leadership post and who should replace him . Nebraska three Republican House members Reps . Bacon , Mike Flood and Adrian Smith voted with their GOP colleagues to elect Johnson . Flood and Smith had also backed Jordan . Bacon drew national attention for opposing him . Statements from Nebraska House members Mike Flood , District : Congratulations to Mike Johnson on his election to be the next Speaker of the House . He is a principled , constitutional conservative who will do a fantastic job leading House Republicans . We have important work in front of us : America needs to step up and support Israel as they fight back against Palestinian terrorism . We need to keep government running for the people , and we need to continue to deliver on our Commitment to America . I know Speaker Johnson has what it takes to bring the House together around these critical priorities , and I look forward to working together on them in the coming days and weeks . Don Bacon , District : Speaker Mike Johnson and I came to Congress in 2016 and have served on the House Armed Services Committee together . In the time I have known him , I can say he is a man with a Reagan like vision for our nation , full of integrity and abounding with decency . We all look forward to getting back to work in the House , and continuing to deliver on the conservative agenda the American people elected us for . Adrian Smith , District : I known Mike Johnson to be a sincere , capable , and humble leader . A man of faith and stand up guy who has always been thoughtful , honest and principled , he has the qualities to bring us together and confront the challenges we face as Americans . This afternoon , I was pleased to vote for him for Speaker on the House floor , and under his leadership I look forward to all we can accomplish to get our country back on track . Bacon , in response to a question from the Nebraska Examiner , said he knows that some constituents in his Omaha based swing district will have trouble seeing differences between Jordan and Johnson . Both are allies of former President Donald Trump who opposed Congress accepting the results of the 2020 election . A retired Air Force brigadier general , Bacon has criticized Johnson and other election deniers since 6 , 2021 . No court challenges against the presidential election found evidence of fraud that would have changed a single state result . The Examiner also asked Bacon on Wednesday about Johnson longtime opposition to gay marriage . I ca say I agree with him on those issues , but we still get to vote our conscience , Bacon said of Johnson . He can stand for one thing , and I can disagree or agree . I do know this : He will listen and he is a team player I trust his character . Johnson vision Bacon said Johnson won his vote by talking about a Ronald Reagan esque vision of conservatism that Bacon said included peace through strength , respect for life and an optimistic outlook that says the greatest days for America are ahead . State Tony Vargas of Omaha said Bacon wasted people time by puffing his chest out on cable news for three weeks , only to vote for an agenda of election denialism , Social Security cuts , and a nationwide abortion ban with no exceptions . Vargas , a Democrat , is seeking a rematch with Bacon in 2024 . He will always go with his party bosses , not step up for Nebraska families in need of support , Vargas said of Bacon . Bacon , who serves Nebraska competitive Congressional District , previously supported Louisiana Steve Scalise bid for speaker and a later bid by Minnesota Tom Emmer . He said Scalise would have been good and Emmer great . Why Jordan was different Bacon said he opposed Jordan because he and his allies sank Scalise bid . Bacon said Jordan group bucked House GOP rules saying Republicans should support the person selected by the party caucus . Five Jordan backers refused to support Scalise , the caucus pick , and vowed to support only Jordan . Scalise soon withdrew his candidacy without a floor vote . Jordan was right there sitting with them , Bacon said . So me , Arkansas Steve Womack and a few others said we were never going to support this guy . That not how we operate in a conference . It was really the way he knifed Steve Scalise . Republicans narrow margin in the House , a 221 212 edge over Democrats that narrows depending on who is absent that day , meant that Jordan could lose more than a handful of votes . He lost 20 , then 22 and then 25 in the three floor votes he forced . Somebody had to have broad shoulders and do it , he said . Jordan secured even less support behind closed doors , Bacon and congressional reporters have said . Jordan lost a secret ballot by his Republican peers 112 86 . The conference did not want Jordan , Bacon said . Bacon said he had other reasons as well to oppose Jordan , including the Ohio congressman lack of support for parts of the next farm bill .

              " 'Royal rift deepens as cash for leaks scam tensions rise The Royal Family feud was ignited by an alleged cash for leaks scheme . NEW DELHI : Explosive revelations in a recent report are set to rock the British Royals as they unveil the underlying cause of the simmering tensions between King Charles and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle . A groundbreaking expose by Byline Times suggests that the Royal Family feud was ignited by an alleged cash for leaks scheme . Moreover , the report claims that the Royal Family may have indirectly benefitted from damaging stories about Meghan Markle . Insiders cited in the report suggest that King Charles was growing increasingly concerned about Harry and Meghan ability to command media attention , potentially overshadowing him and other family members . The undeniable truth is that Harry and Meghan generate more compelling headlines than King Charles , Camilla , William , and Kate . The idea of them remaining in public service but residing overseas , beyond the control of the Royal Institution , and dominating the media narrative , was simply unacceptable , the article contends . The report goes on to state that Charles was faced with two options : either allow the Sussexes to maintain a lower profile in the UK or disentangle them as thoroughly as possible to minimise the risk of them outshining the rest of the family , according to insiders . READ MORE : West Bengal minister arrested by ED in multi crore ration distribution scam Trouble In Funding : Furthermore , the report unveils that King Charles withdrew in funding from Meghan and Harry , and encouraged them to embark on a trial year in Canada . This move was prompted by a cash for leaks scandal involving journalist Dan Wootton . Byline also alleges that a partner of a key aide to Prince William received from The Sun for stories related to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex . The Byline report asserts that these allegations emerged from anonymous emails supposedly sent by administrative staff within the Murdoch newspaper empire , which disclosed payments linked to stories about Archie nannying arrangements and the infamous Megxit narrative from January 2020 . Legal Battles And Fallout : When the Metropolitan Police delved into the leakage allegations , they faced difficulties in securing a warrant to search the properties of royal staff due to the lack of whistleblower identities . In response , Prince Harry issued formal letters before action to News UK , outlining claims concerning Wootton and the palace . The Royal Family was uncomfortable with Harry taking legal action against the tabloids . Initially , the royal household believed that the threat of exposure would compel Harry and Meghan to return to the UK , thus maintaining a controlled profile that would overshadow the future King . However , the financial cut off and ensuing legal complications only served to deepen the divisions within the Royal Family . READ MORE : US hits back at Iran linked sites in Syria amid Israel Palestine war This report aligns with the claims made by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their Netflix docuseries and Prince Harry book The Spare , underscoring that they were targeted by both the royal family and the press .

As research analyst company GlobalData explains in its 2023 report into tech regulation , large fines are easily shrugged off by Big Tech . GlobalData patent analytics database between 2020 and 2023 shows that wearable technology that tracks a user health has continued to be popular . Publications of related patents have steadily remained above 3000 , peaking at almost 4000 in January 2022 . By 2030 , GlobalData forecasts that the total global market for wearable technology will be worth , rising at a CAGR of . Whilst smart glasses and VR headsets have remained fairly unpopular due to shorter hype cycles and a lack of appealing use cases , smartwatches make up the second largest wearable tech group behind hearables wireless headphones and earpieces . GlobalData notes that while smart glasses have failed to become mainstream due to their inability to replace a smartphone , smartwatches paired with a user phone have increasingly replaced fitness bands and regular watches . This ban on Apple is significant , as GlobalData credits the company with creating popular wearables that drive demand due to the Apple brand synonymity with fashion and appearance . Writing on Apple design in a Medium blog post in 2015 , Shahrzad Samadzadeh wrote about Apple role in offering its customers an aspirational lifestyle through its products rather than cutting edge technology . Reflecting on the 2013 release of the iPhone , Samadzadeh states that Apple used the visual style of its phone as the differentiating factor . In wearable technology , this style feature will be instrumental in generating sales and hype . Companies wanting to dip into the market will need to consider this design element at the forefront of their service , rather than relying on relying solely on pioneering technology .',\n",
              " 'Meghan writing bombshell memoir that could ruin ties with William and Kate so badly they may never speak again Meghan writing bombshell memoir that could ruin ties with William and Kate so badly they may never speak again Meghan Markle is believed to be writing a memoir that could contain more explosive details about the royals . Picture : Alamy By Will Taylor Kate Middleton will be \" very concerned \" about Meghan Markle upcoming memoir , a royal expert has said . Listen to this article Loading audio The Duchess of Sussex is reportedly working on her own bombshell book after the release of husband Harry Spare , which contained a raft of claims against the royals including the now King Charles and William . Royal commentator Phil Dampier has now said the family had hoped the Sussexes would run out of ammunition and reduce their rate of attacks from across the Atlantic . But he believes they will have more cause for worry if Meghan publishes her book which could include her version of incidents with Kate . Read more : William and Kate closed their minds to mending family rift after being hurt and insulted by Harry and Meghan \" She would give her side of what really happened between her and Kate in the run up to the wedding , when each allegedly made the other cry , \" he said . \" Everyone will be fascinated to hear Meghan take on her relationship with Kate , whether she was hostile or welcomed her from the start . Meghan Markle is said to be readying a tell all memoir . Picture : Alamy \" She probably thought she should have got equal billing and did seem to appreciate from the start that she and Harry were the B team , not on the same level as William and Kate . \" She will probably talk about comparisons that were made in the press between them and will come across as bitter . \" The book will \" probably sell even more \" copies than Spare , he said . Read more : King Charles mourns heartbreaking loss of life and calls for tolerance and respect amid Israel Hamas conflict Dampier told The Sun : \" The royals will stay quiet and soak it up , even though they will be deeply hurt by it . \" Their policy was for Harry and Meghan to run out of ammunition , but unfortunately they have plenty left in the form of a Meghan book . \" But he added that if Meghan releases details about the Prince and Princess of Wales \" it really would be the last straw and I doubt William and Kate would ever talk to Harry again \" . Kate and William could cut ties with Meghan , a royal commentator fears . Picture : Alamy It was previously reported that the royals were bracing for Meghan to write her own tell all book . Spare was released earlier this year and sold copies across the globe . It became the fastest selling non fiction book ever . It included details of a physical altercation with William and clashes with Charles . But he would later claim that he left out details that he did want the world to know \" because I do think they would ever forgive me \" . The Sussexes have kept a relatively low profile since Spare came out , most recently appearing at the Invictus Games in Germany last month .',\n",

              " 'What will new Speaker Johnson do about Ukraine Israel aid ? The search for a new House Speaker finally concluded on Wednesday with the fourth Republican caucus nominee Mike Johnson R prevailing on the floor , earning the vote of every GOP member . No doubt , the first major issue facing the House right now is President Joe Biden emergency spending bill , which includes 60 billion for Ukraine and 14 billion for Israel . The new Speaker has not commented on how will approach the massive funding bill . When asked about it on Tuesday evening after emerging as the Republican nominee , he told reporters that he was not doing policy tonight . A legislative plan that Johnson circulated two days before clinching the Speakership names support for Mike McCaul R Texas resolution condemning Hamas as a top priority , but he does not mention the funding package . However , Ken Buck R said on CNN that it was his understanding that Johnson was willing to bring the legislation to the floor . While sending more aid to Ukraine has proven a key sticking point among Republicans in a series of Congressional debates in recent months , Johnson has not been outspoken on either side of the issue . In the weeks following Russia invasion , Johnson supported debilitating sanctions on Moscow and posted on X that America stands with Ukraine . However , by May 2022 , Johnson was one of only 57 members to vote against the first tranche of 40 billion in supplemental aid to Ukraine . He released a statement saying , We should not be sending another 40 billion abroad when our own border is in chaos , American mothers are struggling to find baby formula , gas prices are at record highs , and American families are struggling to make ends meet , without sufficient oversight over where the money will go . He has consistently opposed aid for Kyiv since then . His voting record has earned him an F grade in Bill Kristol GOP Congressional Report Card . Meanwhile , the packaging of Israel and Ukraine into one bill has been a divisive question in the Republican caucus , including some who are strong supporters of funding Tel Aviv and Kyiv individually . Nine Republican Senators , led by Rick Scott R and Roger Marshall R wrote a letter to Senate leadership last week urging them to consider the issues of funding for Tel Aviv and Kyiv separately . These are two separate conflicts and it would be wrong to leverage support of aid to Israel in attempt to get additional aid for Ukraine across the finish line , the Senators write . Furthermore , it would be irresponsible and we should not risk a government shutdown by bundling these priorities together and thus complicating the process and lessening the likelihood of a funding package . The letter also notes that 22 Members of the House of Representatives wrote to the then leading candidates to be the next Speaker of the House urging them to deny attempts to couple these issues . The House members who have been opposed to linking the two issues will likely seek to exert similar pressure on Johnson . Many Republicans with similar voting records as Johnson have adopted more aggressive rhetoric than he has toward Ukraine and Biden strategy . Given that he like the rest of the GOP conference has expressed unequivocal support for Israel Johnson may be willing to bring the combined package up to a vote .',\n",
              " 'Morning Scan : All the big stories to get you started for the day A round up of top newspaper stories 1 . European multinationals face tax demands of Rs crore after apex court ruling Many multinational companies headquartered in the Netherlands , Switzerland and France could be staring at retrospective tax demands for around Rs crore on dividend income repatriated from India after a Supreme Court ruling .

A new panel with representatives from the finance ministry , NITI Aayog and the Reserve Bank of India is being considered to draw a fresh list of candidates for privatisation .

The improved performance of those facing the axe would merit reconsideration . 5 . India Digital lenders bet on festive season demand to expand business With the festive season setting in , the digital lending industry is betting big on a quick rebound in business as consumers prepare to loosen purse strings and merchants stock up to meet the additional demand . For digital lending platforms , a demand rebound does not automatically convert into an increase in disbursals , but overall disbursals go up on an average of 15 20 percent during the festive period .

Israel Tower Semiconductor finds no India takers for joint venture Israeli company Tower Semiconductor initial talks with several Indian companies to build a joint venture fab plant that involves the transfer of chip technology have been less than successful . A top Tower management team led by CEO Russell C Ellwanger was in India last week . In 2022 , US chip giant Intel , which signed a deal to buy out Tower for billion , cancelled it and paid a 353 million termination fee . Why it important : It is unclear why the overtures by Tower Semiconductor has been tepid in India , given that the government is offering all kinds of incentives for the country to emerge as a fab hub . 9 . India to take standardised road to charging infrastructure for electric vehicles In response to the expanding electric vehicle sector in India , the central government is preparing to introduce a standardised charging protocol . This move is a reaction to concerns voiced by industry stakeholders about the absence of uniformity in charging infrastructure that has already led to interoperability issues . Why it important : It is desirable to have uniform standards for the entire electric vehicle industry . The charging infrastructure for and three wheelers is highly fragmented at present . 10 .

Advertisement The 51 year old will have to hold together a free wheeling Republican conference that has been hostile to leadership figures . He was the fourth nominee in three weeks chosen after three others won a majority in conference but could not win the GOP votes needed to clinch the gavel on the floor . breaks down the top challenges new Speaker Johnson faces . Small staff and limited fundraising experience The Louisiana Republican and former vice chair of the GOP conference has never chaired a committee and is working with a relatively small staff . Johnson has also only been in Congress since 2016 a relatively short time compared to previous speakers . He be responsible for trying to heal deep divisions among members and will be forced to work closely with two people who tried to get the top job before him : Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Whip Tom Emmer . Speakers are typically responsible for rolling in donations to keep and expand the House majority . Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was a prolific fundraiser , as was Nancy Pelosi before him . But Johnson is not nearly as connected with Washington lobbyists and has only raised in all of 2023 . That pennies on the dollar compared to McCarthy haul just from July to September this year . After securing the gavel and ending three weeks of House impasse , the newly minted Speaker Mike Johnson faces a long list of hurdles Johnson pictured with his wife and children Motion to vacate threat looms Johnson will also have to contend with whether to change the rule that allowed McCarthy swift ouster . In catering to his right wing detractors in January during his tumultuous speaker vote , McCarthy agreed to a single member motion to vacate . That means only one member can call a vote on the House floor to oust the head of the Republicans . Through that rule Matt Gaetz filed the motion that ousted McCarthy earlier this month , joined by seven other Republicans and all Democrats . The rule forced McCarthy to walk a tightrope between appeasing his right wing detractors and working with the Democratic led Senate . That will be a tall order for Johnson during next month spending battle , when the continuing resolution CR that prompted McCarthy firing will expire . But Freedom Caucus aligned members who oppose McCarthy have signaled they will give Johnson more leeway . I proud to support our new Speaker Mike Johnson ! I going to do everything I can to make him successful , Gaetz wrote on Advertisement Rapidly approaching government shutdown At the hour before a September deadline , McCarthy put a clean CR on the floor that extended government funding at 2023 levels set under Pelosi for six weeks . That gave the House more time to pass 12 single subject spending bills to fund each agency of government . But even those party line bills have proved contentious among the fractured conference , and at some point Johnson will have to work with the Democratic led Senate to pass negotiated spending bills . Johnson has proposed putting another CR on the House floor to extend government funding until either January 15 or April 15 so the Senate can not jam the House with a Christmas omnibus . Johnson and his wife in an older photo Johnson opposed the continuing resolution McCarthy put on the floor weeks ago . Johnson conservative voting record raised questions about how well he will be able to negotiate with the Democratic Senate and White House . Dusty Johnson , a pragmatic conservative from South Dakota , told reporters that Johnson places a high importance on civility . He said when he came to office , Mike Johnson came to my office , sat down with me as a new member and talked to me about how important civility was in this place , how even when we disagree with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle , we should try to do it as as people who have good faith and good intention with decency . That is not something very many members will spend time in these halls , preaching the importance of civility , but I bring that up , because that is at his heart who Mike Johnson is . Johnson releases his plan for the upcoming appropriations fight Johnson releases his plan for the upcoming appropriations fight Ukraine aid debacle Johnson has already pushed through a resolution to support Israel that passed with overwhelming support , and now he have to contend with whether to push through more Israel aid amid its war with Hamas and Ukraine aid for its war with Russia . Asked whether he supports Ukraine aid on Tuesday , Johnson told reporters : We all do . We gon na have conditions on that . We working through it . We get you more details . The Senate is considering a request from the White House for a Ukraine , Israel , Taiwan and border security package . Advertisement George Santos legal woes He also have to contend with how to deal with a resolution to expel embattled George Santos . New York Republicans have said they will put forth a privileged resolution next week triggering a vote that would need to pass a two thirds threshold within two legislative days . Johnson has declined to say whether he supports the effort to expel Santos . Doing so would put Republicans down another seat in their four seat majority . Anti Israel rhetoric by Democrats Marjorie Taylor Greene has also filed a resolution to censure Squad Rashida Tlaib , claiming she incited an insurrection when she spoke at a pro Palestinian protest that infiltrated the Capitol campus . Greene called the legislation to the floor by also filing it as a privileged resolution . Johnson has expressed his support for Israel , but it remains to be seen if he back Greene resolution . The new speaker first course of action was putting a resolution in support of Israel and condemning the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7 . Democrats attacks on his denial of the 2020 election and gay rights record Democrats are already after Johnson conservative record and involvement in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election results . Johnson led an amicus brief signed by more than 100 Republicans to a Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election . Asked about his past efforts to overturn the results on Tuesday night , he huffed and told a reporter : next question . Madeleine Dean told that a colleague told her the only difference between Johnson and Ohio firebrand Jim Jordan is that one wears a jacket . Dean predicted Johnson would face the same untrustworthy accusations that were levied against Kevin McCarthy . He not somebody who based in the truth he very smooth talking . He clearly bright , but he not based on the facts and the truth , she said . The deeply religious Johnson also spent years opposing gay rights . As an attorney for the Alliance Defense Fund ADF , a Christian advocacy group , in 2003 warned that the Supreme Court striking down laws that criminalized homosexual activity went against American values . There is clearly no right to sodomy in the Constitution , Johnson wrote in a 2003 column in the Shreveport Times . And the right of privacy of the home has never placed all activity with the home outside the bounds of the criminal law .

Advertisement Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had a stern warning for Johnson : Advertisement If Speaker Johnson repeats the mistakes of Speaker McCarthy , if he tumbles down the MAGA road , it will be inevitable that the House finds itself trapped in even more chaos very soon , he said in a floor speech Thursday . If Speaker Johnson lives up to the label that Congressman Gaetz has given him , MAGA Mike , he will fail as the previous Speakers have .',\n",
              " 'The New Yorker fact checked Hasan Minhaj now he issued a rebuttal The New Yorker fact checked Hasan Minhaj now he issued a rebuttal YouTube It looks a little like a low key version of one of his Daily Show segments or a piece from his former Netflix series Patriot Act . But instead , the 21 minute video released by comic Hasan Minhaj , first published Thursday in the Hollywood Reporter , is a personal , detailed rebuttal tackling elements of a critical article about him published by The New Yorker more than a month ago , titled \" Hasan Minhaj Emotional Truths . \" \" I aware that even talk about this now feels so trivial , \" Minhaj says , noting how the Israel Hamas War has dominated recent news . \" But being accused of fake racism is not trivial . It is very serious , and it demands an explanation . \" Sitting at a desk with graphic images occasionally displayed over his shoulder , Minhaj speaks directly to the camera , asserting that he provided evidence and context to explain why he exaggerated elements in his standup comedy specials , but The New Yorker ignored it . Instead , he says , the story left the impression he had made up or exaggerated racism in his life , which Minhaj strongly denies . He says he created the video to answer the question everyone is thinking : \" Is Hasan Minhaj just a con artist who uses fake racism and Islamaphobia to advance his career ? Because after reading that article , I would also think that . \" A spokesperson for The New Yorker declined to speak on the record about Minhaj claims , providing a statement which supports their story : \" Hasan Minhaj confirms in this video that he selectively presents information and embellishes to make a point : exactly what we reported . Our piece , which includes Minhaj perspective at length , was carefully reported and fact checked . It is based on interviews with more than 20 people , including former Patriot Act and Daily Show staffers ; members of Minhaj security team ; and people who have been the subject of his standup work , including the former informant Brother Eric and the woman at the center of his prom rejection story . We stand by our story . \" The stakes are high for Minhaj press accounts say he was considered a front runner for the permanent host of The Daily Show before The New Yorker story was published Puck News has since reported he was officially informed he will not be getting the job . But as even he makes clear , his reputation is at stake . Comic Bill Maher , who has been accused of Islamaphobia in his commentary , aired a biting critique during his show Real Time with Bill Maher , saying , \" The stories Minhaj tells in his act to elicit sympathy for himself as a Muslim and a person of color are completely made up . \" Here are a few important assertions from the video Minhaj has provided . He says the article implies that race was a factor in why he was dumped by a white classmate just before they were to attend their high school prom producing emails and text messages between them to insist he was not \" needlessly cruel \" to her in telling the story . A pivotal moment in Minhaj standup special Homecoming King involves the comic talking about how he was dumped the night of his senior prom , with his date mother telling him the rest of their family would understand prom pictures with a brown skinned boy . In the video , Minhaj admits that the incident happened days before the dance , but says he was rejected because of his race . The New Yorker story said the woman \" turned down Minhaj , who was then a close friend , in person , days before the dance . Minhaj acknowledged that this was correct , but he said that the two of them had long carried different understandings of her rejection . \" The story also asserts that he \" shrugged off her concerns \" about people discovering her identity and that that they had a strained friendship . In response , Minhaj presents friendly texts and emails from the woman , and notes that he calls her \" Bethany \" on stage to protect her anonymity . Minhaj says in his new video he did have altercations with undercover law enforcement while growing up , though he does not fully detail the circumstances . The New Yorker story notes that the comic 2022 special The King Jester features a segment alleging Craig Monteilh , a real life FBI informant who spied on Muslim communities in Southern California , had infiltrated the mosque frequented by Minhaj family under the name \" Brother Eric . \" Monteilh said that he never visited that mosque or met Minhaj , which the comic acknowledged in The New Yorker story . In his new video , Minhaj says he did have altercations with law enforcement growing up as a young Muslim man , and he was trying to communicate that experience , apologizing for adding to a dynamic where false stories about police excess can undermine real stories . Minhaj says someone did send him an envelope containing white powder that he opened near his daughter . But contrary to the story he tells in The King Jester , he knew right away it was not anthrax , the contents did not spill onto her and she was not rushed to the hospital . Minhaj says he and his wife decided to keep the white powder incident secret when it happened at a time when he was getting pushback on a controversial Patriot Act episode about Saudi Arabia because they were worried Netflix might cancel the series . \" I am sorry for embellishing the story , if anyone was worrying about me and my family , \" he says in the video . There are some incidents described in The New Yorker story that Minhaj does address in his new video . The New Yorker story says , \" Minhaj has elided or concocted other details in his stories , often to place himself more squarely at the center of the action . \" For example , in The King Jester special , Minhaj says he met with officials at the Saudi Embassy in Washington , , as news broke that journalist Jamal Khashoggi had been murdered at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul . But The New Yorker quotes an unnamed producer who said the meeting took place at least a month earlier . Similarly , The New Yorker says Minhaj story about Jared Kushner sitting in a seat that was ceremonially kept vacant for imprisoned Saudi activists at a gala was not true . Minhaj is quoted in The New Yorker admitting that he exaggerated both incidents , but he does address them in his new video . Minhaj new video and The New Yorker story both turn on the thorny idea of how much accuracy is required from comics who say they are telling true stories about racism , social issues and real people . Minhaj tries straddling a difficult line . He admits that his exaggerations often involve tough subjects like police excess , racism and Islamaphobia issues more serious than the overstatements made by many typical standup comics . But Minhaj also insists he did not cross the line into inventing his personal experiences with racism . In his new video , while apologizing for some exaggerations , Minhaj also says there is a difference between how he handles factual material in political comedy shows like Patriot Act and standup specials . \" In political comedy , facts come first , \" he says in the video . \" In comedic storytelling , emotions come first . \"',\n",

              " 'Here How New House Speaker Mike Johnson Voted on Veteran and Military Issues The man who became speaker of the House on Wednesday after three weeks of GOP infighting has a solidly conservative voting record that includes opposing both the sweeping toxic exposure bill for veterans passed last year and the Pentagon abortion policy . Mike Johnson , R , won the speakership Wednesday with every Republican vote . He was the GOP fourth choice for speaker since Kevin McCarthy , R , was ousted from the job at the beginning of October , effectively shutting down the House until a new leader was chosen . The victory marked a rapid rise for Johnson , who joined Congress in 2017 and since 2020 has been the vice chairman of the House Republican Conference , a messaging job that made him the fifth highest ranking Republican in the House . While he has generally kept a low profile for the last six years , he was perhaps most well known before Wednesday for playing a leading role in Republicans efforts to overturn the 2020 election . Read Next : Jet Experienced Landing Gear Anomaly on Runway , Marine Corps Says On veterans issues , last year he voted against the PACT Act , considered the biggest increase of veterans benefits in a generation that expanded benefits and health care for those exposed to toxic substances during their military service . While some top Republicans ended up supporting the version of the PACT Act that became law , more staunch conservatives continued to oppose it over the estimated 278 billion price tag . Johnson also voted against a year end package of smaller veterans and military family measures last year . Among other provisions , the bill mandated that states recognize service members and spouses valid professional licenses from other states and ensured veterans wo lose GI Bill benefits if schools have to close in a future emergency like they did for the pandemic . Johnson has supported major Republican backed veterans legislation , including the 2018 Mission Act that made it easier for veterans to see doctors outside the Department of Veterans Affairs system . He also voted for a 2017 bill intended to make it easier to fire problem employees at the VA . The VA said this year it was no longer using the authority granted by the bill because it was rendered useless by years of litigation , infuriating Republicans . Johnson has also backed widely popular veterans bills , including voting for the Forever GI Bill in 2017 and co sponsoring the Major Richard Star Act , a top priority this year for veterans groups that would give service members who medically retire full access to both military retirement pay and VA disability benefits . Johnson , who was a lawyer before turning to politics , has served on the House Armed Services Committee since 2021 . He has voted for final passage for every annual defense policy bill since coming to Congress , including voting to override then President Donald Trump veto of the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act over its mandate to remove Confederate names from military bases . Johnson has also supported controversial , conservative amendments to the NDAA , including this year voting to ban gender affirming health care for transgender troops and to repeal the Pentagon policy giving troops travel reimbursements and leave for abortions . In a letter to his colleagues released shortly before Wednesday speaker vote , Johnson pledged to pass a House Senate compromise version of this year NDAA in December . By contrast to his regular support for the NDAA , Johnson has voted against nearly every omnibus government funding bill since coming to Congress . Omnibuses combine funding for every government agency into one bill and are typically opposed by conservatives . He voted against the stopgap spending measure Congress passed last month to prevent a government shutdown . Meanwhile , he supported the House Pentagon and Veterans Affairs spending bills , which were both packed with GOP policy riders such as provisions to bar abortion services , transgender health care , and Pride flags at the VA . As more Republicans have come out in opposition to Ukraine aid , Johnson has joined them . He voted in favor of amendments to the NDAA and Pentagon spending bill that would have stripped Ukraine funding from the bills and against a stand alone bill last month to provide Ukraine 300 million . Government funding and Ukraine aid will be among his first challenges as speaker . Current government funding expires in less than a month , while the White House has requested Congress also approve roughly 106 billion in funding for Ukraine , Israel , the Indo Pacific and border security . In his letter to colleagues Wednesday , Johnson said he would propose another stopgap spending measure to keep the government open past 17 , when current funding expires . His plan would extend funding to either 15 or April 15 , depending on what the majority of the House Republican conference supports . Either date could risk an across the board 1 cut to government spending , including at the Pentagon and the VA . Under the deal Congress approved earlier this year to stave off a debt default , the government must start planning for a 1 spending cut if full year appropriations bills are passed by 1 . The cuts would actually take effect until April 30 . Rebecca Kheel can be reached at . Follow her on X .

Advertisement A series of satellite images , shared on the IDF official website and social media accounts , shows what they claim are launch pits dug into the ground right next to the civilian structures something Israel says backs up their claims that Hamas is using the Palestinian people as human shields . Two alleged launch sites were located a stone throw away from each other , one in the garden of a mosque , and another mere feet away from a kindergarten . A third was seen across the road from a UN building in Gaza and a fourth was located opposite the Manfaluti Secondary School for Boys . Geolocation of the images provided by the IDF confirmed the locations given were correct , and analysts pointed out that previous satellite images taken in September did not show any launch sites suggesting that they would have been recently constructed . Since the beginning of the war , the Hamas terrorist organization has been exploiting civilians and civilian sites such as kindergartens , schools , and mosques for the purpose of firing rockets at Israel . Hamas deliberately fires its rockets at Israeli civilians , IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said . The presence of rocket launch sites at the locations provided could not be independently verified . Meanwhile Israel is accused of conducting indiscriminate airstrikes on Gaza civilian population , as the two week old war with Hamas threatened to spiral into a broader conflict . Israeli warplanes continued to strike targets in Gaza throughout the weekend and into Monday morning , as well as two airports in Syria and a mosque in the occupied West Bank allegedly used by militants .

Here , the location of the alleged launch site next to the kindergarten is seen hundreds of feet from the mosque Israel has traded fire with Lebanon Hezbollah militant group on a near daily basis since the war began . Tensions are soaring in the Israeli occupied West Bank , where its forces have battled militants in refugee camps and carried out two air strikes in recent days . Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told troops in northern Israel that if Hezbollah launches a war against Israel , it will make the mistake of its life . We will cripple it with a force it can not even imagine and the consequences for it and the Lebanese state will be devastating . Advertisement For days , Israel has seemed to be on the verge of launching a ground offensive in Gaza as part of its response to the deadly October 7 rampage . Tanks and tens of thousands of troops have massed at the border , and Israeli leaders have spoken of an undefined next stage in operations . But the military acknowledges there are still hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza despite a sweeping evacuation order , which would complicate any ground attack . And the risk of triggering a broader war with Hamas allies in Lebanon and Syria might also give them pause . On Saturday , 20 trucks of aid were allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah crossing , the first time anything has gone into the territory since Israel imposed a complete siege two weeks ago . On Sunday , another convoy of 17 trucks bringing aid to besieged Palestinians crossed into Gaza , Egypt state run media reported . But aid workers said it is far too little to address the spiralling humanitarian crisis in Gaza , where half the territory million people have fled their homes . Hospitals packed with patients and displaced people are running low on medical supplies and fuel for generators , forcing doctors to perform surgeries with sewing needles , using kitchen vinegar as disinfectant , and without anaesthesia . Palestinians sheltering in UN run schools and tent camps are running low on food and drinking dirty water . The territory sole power plant shut down more than a week ago , causing a territory wide blackout and crippling water and sanitation systems .

Military spokesman Hagari said Israel plans to step up air strikes , starting from Saturday , as preparation for the next stages of the war . Israel has vowed to crush Hamas but has given few details about what it envisions for Gaza if it succeeds . Yifat Shasha Biton , a Cabinet minister , told Channel 13 TV there is broad consensus in the government that there will have to be a buffer zone in Gaza to keep Palestinians away from the border . An Israeli ground assault is likely to lead to a dramatic escalation in casualties on both sides .

Syrian state media meanwhile reported that Israeli air strikes have targeted the international airports in the capital , Damascus , and the northern city of Aleppo . It said the strikes killed one person and damaged the runways , putting them out of service . Israel has carried out several strikes in Syria , including on the airports , since the war began . Israel rarely acknowledges individual strikes , but says it acts to prevent Hezbollah and other militant groups from bringing in arms from their patron , Iran , which also supports Hamas . In the occupied West Bank , dozens of Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops , arrest raids and attacks by Jewish settlers . Israeli forces have closed crossings into the territory and checkpoints between cities , measures they say are aimed at preventing attacks .

Sunday fatalities take the death toll in the West Bank to 90 Palestinians since the war broke out on October 7 , according to the health ministry . Most appear to have been killed during fighting with Israeli forces or violent protests . Thirteen Palestinians , including five minors , and a member of Israel paramilitary border police were killed last week in a battle in a refugee camp in the West Bank town of Tulkarem , in which Israel also launched an air strike . In Gaza , the Israeli military said the humanitarian situation is under control as aid workers called for the opening of a round the clock aid corridor . The UN humanitarian agency , known as OCHA , said the convey that entered on Saturday carried about 4 per cent of an average day imports before the war and a fraction of what is needed after 13 days of complete siege . It is calling for 100 trucks a day to enter . Huge quantities of aid have been gathered near the Egyptian side of the crossing , but there has been no word on when more might enter .

While Hamas as a terrorist organisation does not accept the various international laws in place for stipulating war conduct , Israel as a democracy does . This is the reason that despite military training to Israeli soldiers in humanitarian conduct , the current scale of the war can result in breaches that can later be tried in both Israeli and international courts The Israel Hamas war has now reached to an unprecedented scale seen in recent times . Image source : AP New Delhi : The cross border rocket firings and subsequent incursions in Israeli territory by Hamas , have today resulted in a war which is unprecedented in recent scale . While the initial attack caught Israeli authorities by surprise , they later fought back with air strikes on various locations in Gaza and preparations for a massive on ground offensive are imminent . The war which became inevitable due to the scale and barbarity of the first offence , has now reached a level where the amount of casualties on both sides is increasing with time .

The violence , whatever may be the level of justification given by any side , has incited some level of criticism from different international organisations . The Israel Defense Forces have been successful in their campaign of air strikes which have destroyed a spate of weapon warehouses , command centres and tunnels . Their on ground offensives have also been successful as they have targeted and killed several Hamas commanders and gunmen . What remains problematic is that the region of Gaza Strip is densely populated and inevitably has large sections of civilian populations residing there . While major chunks of such populations have been told to relocate from the northern parts of Gaza to its southern parts , there still are complications when it comes to the execution of the on ground offensives . Much of this has caused severe damage to infrastructure , with many neighbourhoods damaged beyond recognition . This too has resulted in a lot of injuries and casualties to citizens . The scale of the offensive has also incited a lot of negative commentary on social media but the major question that remains is whether rules of war are being followed . Many international laws defining rules of armed engagement exist , principally the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , which stipulate the humanitarian laws states are bound to follow during times of war . Israel too is a party to the Geneva Convention . The Geneva Conventions , lists Palestine as a signatory party as well , meaning that both sides to this war are bound by the laws of armed conflict . What is important to note when it comes to laws such as the Geneva Convention is that these are enforceable and complaints of non compliance can be filed in international courts and other organisations . While Hamas , as a terrorist organisation , does not accept such stipulations , Israel as a democracy does . The scale of the initial Hamas offensive against Israel also can help understand why their reaction has been so extreme . The early incursion into Israeli territory and the resulting killings of innocent victims and their kidnapping and mutilations is what led Israel to start the offensive . But being part of many of the international humanitarian organisations and governing bodies , Israel code of practice is still intent on avoiding civilian casualties and even the current circumstantial evidence point to that . A major part of the IDF and it just behaviour despite the extreme scale of barbarity of Hamas attack is that the actions of the Israeli government are ultimately subject to Israeli courts . Unlike the operations of Hamas , the military operations of Israel are conducted at the direction of the government and overseen by the judiciary . It is not arbitrary like that of Hamas . The level of international scrutiny that the Israeli Army has always been under , has resulted in the IDF giving its soldiers and commanders with education in training of international humanitarian law . In addition the education of Israeli soldiers , due to the peculiarity of their situation , is all round and far exceeds just military education . From which weapons to use in what context to who is to be destined , how to conduct operations in civilian populations is an ingrained part in the training that Israeli soldiers get . Even after all such precautionary measures , if some allegations of purported war crimes do reach Israeli authorities , they are taken up by independent military and civilian bodies and reviewed by the civil justice system and the Supreme Court .

              " 'Exclusive military steps up Middle East surveillance as threats to troops grow The military is also beefing up monitoring from guard towers on military facilities , hiking security at base access points and increasing operations to counter potential incoming drones , rockets and missiles , the officials say . The measures include increasing military patrols , restricting access to base facilities and hiking intelligence collection , including through drone and other surveillance operations , officials say , speaking on condition of anonymity . By Phil Stewart WASHINGTON Reuters The military is taking new steps to protect its troops in the Middle East as concerns mount about attacks by Iran backed groups , and it is leaving open the possibility of evacuations of military families if needed , officials tell Reuters . The new package of force protection measures have not been previously reported . With the increase in the number of attacks and attempted attacks on military locations , continuous review of our force protection measures is critical , Army General Michael Erik Kurilla , head of Central Command , said in a statement to Reuters . Kurilla , who oversees American forces in the Middle East , said the steps already taken to increase force protection measures , as well as the deployment of additional military assets to the region in recent days , has prevented more serious casualties of our forces in theater . forces in Iraq and Syria have been repeatedly targeted since the Israel Gaza conflict began on 7 . The attacks have caused minor injuries to four service members so far and five military contractors , all of whom returned to duty , one of the officials said . Last week off the coast of Yemen , a warship shot down more than a dozen drones and four cruise missiles fired by Iranian backed Houthis . The heightened tensions have put personnel on constant alert . During a false alarm at Al Asad air base in Iraq on Thursday , a civilian contractor died from cardiac arrest . A military official , speaking on condition of anonymity , did not specifically say what might trigger the evacuation of military families , who are deployed to Middle East locations including Bahrain , home to the Navy Fifth Fleet . We continuously review and should we think the threat is rising to a level that threatens the dependents of our service members in the region , we will err on the side of caution , the official told Reuters . Senior Biden administration officials including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have warned of the risk of major escalation in attacks on American troops in the Middle East and that Iran could seek to widen the Israel Hamas war . We see a prospect for much more significant escalation against forces and personnel in the near term and let be clear about it , the road leads back to Iran , a senior defense official told Pentagon reporters on Monday . Austin has ordered new air defenses to the Middle East to safeguard troops , including a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense THAAD system . The United States has also sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region to try to deter Iran and Iran backed groups , including two aircraft carriers . The Pentagon has said it has not seen a direct order from the highest levels in Iran to carry out the attacks . But White House spokesperson John Kirby said it was clear that Iran was facilitating them . We know that Iran is closely monitoring these events , and in some cases actively facilitating these attacks and spurring on others who may want to exploit the conflict for their own good for Iran , Kirby said on Monday . Iranian security officials told Reuters Iran strategy was for Middle East proxies like Hezbollah to pursue limited strikes on Israeli and targets but to avoid a major escalation that would draw in Tehran .

              " 'European Union Foreign Policy Chief calls for humanitarian pause in Israel Hamas Conflict European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has added his voice to the growing international calls for a humanitarian pause in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas . The purpose of this pause is to allow much needed aid supplies to reach the people of Gaza , who have been caught in the crossfire of the conflict . Borrell made these remarks as he arrived for a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg . He emphasized the urgent need for humanitarian support to be delivered to Gaza , expressing concern for the well being of Palestinian civilians who have been severely impacted by the violence . The European Union foreign policy chief statement follows a similar call from the United Nations Secretary General , Antonio Guterres . The international community is increasingly uniting behind the idea that a pause in the conflict is necessary to ensure that essential humanitarian aid can reach those in need in Gaza . During the meeting of EU foreign ministers , Borrell addressed the issue , saying , \" I can not anticipate the result of the meeting , but it is certainly something which the ministers will have to discuss . The Secretary General of the United Nations asked for it very much . Personally , I think a humanitarian pause is needed in order to allow humanitarian support to come in and be distributed . \" Borrell further elaborated on the matter , highlighting the importance of not only humanitarian aid but also addressing the security concerns in the region . He emphasized , \" The attacks of missiles , rockets from Hamas , from Gaza , have to stop . The hostages , the people who have been kidnapped , have to be released . Obviously , it is part of any step towards de escalation , and we have to start thinking of how to revive the political process . But the priority at the moment is to make humanitarian support go into Gaza . \" As the international community intensifies its efforts to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza , the EU foreign ministers meeting is expected to play a crucial role in shaping the response to the Israel Hamas conflict . The push for a humanitarian pause aims to alleviate the suffering of civilians and create conditions for a more substantial and lasting resolution to the ongoing crisis .',\n",

              " 'Landlines and terror tunnels : This is how Hamas hid preparations for its attack CNN revealed late Tuesday night new details about how Hamas prepared for its murderous surprise attack on October 7 while hiding it from Israel . According to the report , the planning lasted two whole years and was done by a small cell of operatives in the terrorist organization , who communicated with each other through telephone landlines installed in the extensive network of Hamas tunnels in the Gaza Strip that is nicknamed the \" Metro of Gaza . \" Follow Ynetnews on Facebook Twitter Instagram TikTok Read more : The Hamas operatives , according to the report , made sure to avoid using computers and other means of communication , such as mobile phones , which Israeli intelligence can more easily track . The CNN report is based on two sources who are familiar with intelligence information that Israel passed on to the US , and it reports that the activities of the cell that was responsible for the preparations for the terrorist attack were kept a secret even from the majority of the terrorists who took part in the invasion of Israel . Although those terrorists underwent a variety of training by Hamas , they were exposed to the specific plan only a few days before its implementation . 2 View gallery Palestinian operatives in a terror tunnel under Gaza Photo : Reuters The Palestinian terrorists use of \" outdated \" communication technology to evade Israeli intelligence is not surprising , and CNN quotes an Israeli source who says that even in Operation Home and Garden operation in the Jenin refugee camp in July , a communication system based on telephone lines was exposed . According to the source , the forces that then raided the refugee camp uncovered a network of closed circuit surveillance cameras , which were designed to provide early warning of the movements of the security forces , in addition to secure phone lines . The CNN report is one of several from numerous outlets in the past two weeks that have reported on the intelligence and operational failure that enabled the deadliest terrorist attack in Israel history , in which people were murdered including babies , children , women and the elderly , and more than 200 were kidnapped to Gaza . Alongside the \" conception \" under which both the political and military levels were convinced that Hamas was \" deterred \" and interested in continuing to receive the economic benefits that were agreed upon with it after Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021 , the public training carried out by Hamas and Islamic Jihad were not seen as significant as far as Israel was concerned . 2 View gallery A Hamas military exercise in the Gaza Strip Hamas and Jihad did not at all hide these training sessions , in which they practiced more than once taking over Israeli communities , and they even set up bases to simulate them ; but Israeli officials did not take this seriously . \" They always train their people this way , it did seem different , \" one of the officials told CNN in describing how these trainings were perceived in Israel .',\n",

              " 'Israel carries out larger ground raids in Gaza before withdrawing Israeli ground forces operated within the northern Gaza Strip early Thursday , attacking multiple targets before withdrawing , the military said in a statement on what Israel Army Radio described as the biggest incursion of the current conflict . Video of the overnight action issued by the military showed armored vehicles proceeding through a sandy border zone . A bulldozer is seen leveling part of a raised bank , tanks fire shells , and explosions are seen near or amid a row of damaged buildings . Black smoke billowed into the sky after a blast in the grainy night vision footage the military released hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared preparations for a ground war were underway . The military statement posted online said the incursion was carried out \" in preparation for the next stages of combat , \" a possible reference to the large scale invasion that Israeli leaders have threatened as part of the war to destroy Palestinian resistance group Hamas . \" The soldiers have since exited the area and returned to Israeli territory , \" the military statement added . The black and white video showed a column of armored vehicles moving near Gaza border fence . Other footage appeared to show an airstrike and buildings being struck with munitions , sending debris flying high . Just hours earlier , Netanyahu had delivered a nationally televised address to Israelis , telling them \" we are in the midst of a campaign for our existence , \" following the 7 incursion by Palestinian group Hamas . Israel retaliated with relentless strikes that Gaza Hamas run Health Ministry said has killed more than , mainly civilians a toll expected to rise substantially if Israeli troops massed near Gaza move in .

Entire neighborhoods have been razed , surgeons are operating without anesthetic on some of the wounded , and ice cream trucks have become makeshift morgues . In chaotic scenes , volunteer emergency crew and neighbors have clawed , sometimes with their bare hands , through broken concrete and sand to pull out civilian casualties . All too often they recover only their corpses , which have piled up , wrapped in blood stained white shrouds . President Joe Biden , a strong supporter of Israel , has joined the calls for it to \" protect innocent civilians \" and to follow the \" laws of war \" as it pursues Hamas targets . Leaders of the 27 member European Union were Thursday debating whether to call for a \" humanitarian pause \" in the war to deliver desperately needed aid . French President Emmanuel Macron , speaking in Cairo on Wednesday , warned that \" a massive intervention that would put civilian lives at risk would be an error . \" And Jordan King Abdullah II said anger at the suffering could \" lead to an explosion \" in the Middle East . Raining down hellfire Netanyahu amid the growing calls to temper the ferocious bombing campaign said Israel had been \" raining down hellfire on Hamas \" and killing \" thousands of terrorists . \" He said his war cabinet and the military would determine the timing of a \" ground offensive \" with the goal to \" eliminate Hamas \" and \" bring our captives home . \" But he stressed that \" I will not detail when , how or how many \" forces would take part . Netanyahu also acknowledged for the first time that he would have to explain the security lapses exposed on 7 . \" The fault will be examined and everyone will have to give answers , including me , \" he said . \" But all this will happen later . \" Biden , also contemplating the future , stressed that \" when this crisis is over , there has to be a vision of what comes next . \" He reiterated that Washington supports a two state solution with independent Israeli and Palestinian states . \" It means a concentrated effort for all the parties Israelis , Palestinians , regional partners , global leaders to put us on a path toward peace , \" said the president .',\n",

Biden said his assumption was based on his instinct and he did not have any proof for it . I convinced one of the reasons Hamas attacked when it did , and I have no proof of this , just my instinct tells me , is because of the progress we were making towards regional integration for Israel , and regional integration overall . We ca leave that work behind , Biden said . Hamas had launched a murderous attack inside Israel on October 7 that killed over 300 soldiers and civilians , including women and children . It also kidnapped over 200 Israelis , many holding dual citizenship of western countries . This is the second time after the Hamas attack that Biden has mentioned the India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor IMEEC as a potential reason . Meanwhile , speaking in Bishkek , Jaishankar said the IMEEC and the International North South Transport Corridor INSTC would bring economic stability to the region . Both corridors are being backed by different sets of actors and India is the only common country in them . I am confident that the IMEEC and the INSTC could become enablers in bringing economic prosperity to the region , said Jaishankar while speaking at the SCO heads of government meeting . At the same time connectivity initiatives should always respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries , added the minister , who also tweeted a video of the opening ceremony that featured a Hindi song . The IMEEC is seen as a direct competitor to China Belt and Road Initiative BRI while the INSTC is seen as an indirect challenger . The IMEEC runs broadly from the East to the West , just like the BRI , whereas the INSTC runs from the North to the South . Jaishankar also sounded a warning about intemperate investments .

              " 'Dealing with an emboldened Iran OPINION : The terrorist attack on Israel , which killed more than Israelis and foreigners and injured thousands , with over 200 hostages , was aided by a complicit Iran that provided training , funding and support to Hamas . Iran praised the terrorist attack on Israel , and its foreign minister cautioned Israel to stop its attack on Gaza , warning the war might expand to other parts of the Middle East if Hezbollah joins the battle . Lebanon Hezbollah , also a proxy of Iran , shares an 80 mile border with Israel and has over fighters and tens of thousands of rockets and missiles that could be used against Israel . In Syria , Iran has established over 50 military bases , using Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ground forces , the Quds Force , and intelligence services to support dictator Bashar Assad regime and ensure that Iran can project power beyond its borders . Israel shares a 40 mile border along the Golan Heights with Syria . It obvious that Israel is surrounded by enemies , all supported by a hostile Iran . President Biden visit to Israel was a vivid display of support for Israel , as was the deployment to Israel of the USS Gerald Ford Carrier Strike Group , followed by the USS Dwight Eisenhower Strike Group , in addition to a heightened Air Force fighter presence in the region . This is in addition to the billions of dollars in military aid to Israel that Biden is asking Congress to approve . In September 2022 , Iran was riveted by massive demonstrations protesting the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini , arrested by the morality police for not wearing her headscarf properly . Countrywide demonstrations , led by women and girls , demanded long denied freedom and equality denied to women , with the slogan Women , Life , Freedom . There was some initial hope that these demonstrations , some of which called for the death to the dictator , would have an impact , but the supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , supported by loyalist mullahs , brooked no dissent and brutally cracked down on the demonstrations , killing over 500 , with hundreds wounded and imprisoned , and at least seven publicly executed . This is the Iran that supports Hamas , Hezbollah , and its proxies in Yemen , Syria and Iraq . And it will be Iran that will incite a regional war against Israel if Gaza is invaded with an ensuing protracted war , with massive civilian casualties and widespread destruction . There is no doubt that Israel must respond to Hamas horrific terrorist attack and do what necessary to free the hostages and destroy Hamas leaders and fighters . That does preclude , however , seeking a dialogue with the Palestinian Authority , which oversees the West Bank . Or being open to a path to Palestinian statehood while expanding on the Abraham Accords diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Morocco , Sudan and Kosovo and seeking normal relations with Saudi Arabia , an issue that obviously concerns Iran . What obvious is that Iran has not been deterred from using proxies to attack Israel and foment unrest in the Middle East , with the goal of Iran becoming the regional hegemon . A continued robust presence of the is imperative , as we witnessing now with Hamas and by extension Iran terrorist attack on Israel . Indeed , an emboldened Iran , according to the journals Semafor and Iran International , conducted an extensive influence operation in the , working through sympathetic scholars , analysts and influencers for nearly a decade to skew policy in favor of Iran . China response to the Hamas terrorist attack was a general statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemning harm to civilians and stating that China is a friend to both Israel and Palestine . China normalized relations with Iran in 1992 and is buying significant quantities of oil from Saudi Arabia and Iran , more than tripling its imports of Iranian oil in the past two years . A war in the Middle East would adversely affect China and its dependence on Saudi and Iranian oil to fuel its industrial base . And as witnessed in March this year , it was China that facilitated the normalization of relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia . It clear that China has interests in the Middle East and wants to be a major player in the region . For these obvious reasons , the , in its talks with Beijing , could and should encourage China to become more involved in deterring Iran destabilizing behavior , especially with its support of Hamas and Hezbollah and its hostility to Israel and its recent terrorist attack on Israel that killed and wounded thousands of civilians . This message that should resonate with the Chinese people Israel , a sovereign country , being attacked by terrorists supported by Iran . Hopefully , even Xi Jinping will see the value in trying to moderate Iran behavior , given the impact this will have on his nation international credibility in dealing with a terrorist Iranian state . The should also caution North Korea to refrain from providing weapons the rocket propelled grenade , a shoulder fired weapon used against armored vehicles to Hamas , despite denials from Pyongyang . Equally concerning is the reported weaponry North Korea is providing to Russia for its war in Ukraine . North Korea has a long record of selling rockets , missiles and weaponry to Iran , Liby , and Syria for needed cash to pay for their nuclear and missile programs . Resuming a dialogue with North Korea to discuss these and other issues should be a priority for the Biden administration . As President Biden noted in his address to the nation : American leadership is what holds the world together . And that leadership requires credible integrated deterrence diplomatic , economic , and military throughout the world , especially now . Joseph DeTrani is the former special envoy for six party negotiations with North Korea 2003 2006 and the former director of the National Counterproliferation Center .

              " 'America House of Representatives finally has a speaker Listen to this story . Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the audio element . A s America House of Representatives began its fourth week without a speaker , it seemed like nothing would ever get Republicans to unite behind a new leader . But it turns out something could bring the fractious party together : sheer exhaustion , mixed with the possibility of having to govern with Democrats . On October Republicans unanimously voted for Mike Johnson , a 51 year old congressman from Louisiana , to lead the lower chamber . Three previous nominees had dropped out after failing to get the support needed for the job . Mr Johnson , a lawyer and self described full spectrum conservative , has quietly risen through the ranks on Capitol Hill since arriving in 2017 . He held relatively low key positions in Republican leadership and for two years led the Republican Study Committee , an ideological caucus that counts a large majority of House Republicans as members . Yet Mr Johnson has never even served as a committee chairman . Democrats who worked with hard right Republicans to dispose of Kevin McCarthy may have hoped for a more moderate replacement . They are likely to be disappointed with the outcome . Mr Johnson congressional website describes him as a leading defender of the right to life , religious liberty , free speech , the Second Amendment and free market principles , and the father of four stands out as a social conservative even within the Republican Party . Compared with Jim Jordan , a mentor whose own speakership bid failed , Mr Johnson has had a little more success sponsoring bills that actually became law . Perhaps most troubling , Mr Johnson has indulged some of his party worst impulses in recent years . He voted against certifying the 2020 election results and lobbied House Republicans to support a long shot lawsuit to invalidate electoral college votes in several states won by Joe Biden . Will Mr Johnson behave responsibly now that he is in a real position of power especially as he has to negotiate with Democrats , given Republicans slim nine seat majority in the House ? After the painful process of finding a leader , Republicans will be eager to avoid such an embarrassing spectacle again . And , lacking Mr McCarthy baggage , the new speaker could have some space to compromise . For now , at least , he is operating with some sense of urgency . We going to dispense with all the usual ceremonies and celebrations that traditionally follow a new speakership , because we have no time , Mr Johnson said minutes after getting promoted . You going to see an aggressive schedule in the days and weeks ahead . You going to see Congress working as hard as it ever worked . He added with a smile , I want to thank you for being patient with us . The House immediately moved to pass a resolution condemning Hamas : its first vote will also be the easiest . The first real challenge will be finding a way to fund the government . On September the House passed a bill to temporarily fund it at current levels . This averted a shutdown but only until November . Mr Johnson voted against the so called continuing resolution last month , though he showed more pragmatism earlier in the year when he supported a bill that raised the debt ceiling . In a letter to colleagues on October Mr Johnson the candidate laid out an ambitious plan to pass a series of spending bills instead of one large long term funding package . But intraparty fighting has made it hard to agree within the House , let alone negotiate with the rest of the government . They actually have to pass something and work with the Senate and work with the president , says Philip Wallach , an expert on Congress at the American Enterprise Institute . He finds himself in the worst sort of predicament from day one . Mr Johnson acknowledged that the House may need to pass another stopgap bill to fund the government into next year , hoping to ensure the Senate can not jam the House with a Christmas omnibus . Such a bill would package several measures into one big piece of legislation . That does not mean a government shutdown is entirely out of the question . Even if Republicans finally agree on legislation , Democrats could find it unacceptable and bet that Republicans would receive more blame for a government closure . The other urgent matter is the national security funding request made by Mr Biden on October . The spending package would allocate to fund Ukraine defence ; for Israel ; for America immigration crisis ; in humanitarian aid for Gaza ; and an additional in foreign support for the defence budgets of countries in Asia . The proposal should easily pass the Senate , which plans to hold hearings on the legislation on October . Yet House Republicans have grown much more sceptical about assisting Ukraine . The new speaker had yet to reveal his strategy on the national security request by the time this article was published , but he did call the aid package a top welcome about turn for Mr Johnson , who has routinely voted against aid for Ukraine . We have to ensure that Vladimir Putin is not successful , he told reporters . One possibility will be dividing each of the requests into separate bills and allowing separate votes . But he will have to move cautiously on this given the Republican Party isolationist streak One member of Congress can still call for a vote to oust Mr Johnson , and it would take only a handful of Republicans working with every Democrat to remove him from the speakership . House Republicans certainly want to avoid the chaos and drama of another speakership fight . But if recent weeks have shown anything , it is that their capacity for political self harm remains unmatched .

              " 'UN chief raises concerns about clear violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza , angering Israel UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday alleged violations of international law in Gaza and urged an immediate ceasefire as Israel pounds the Palestinian territory in response to Hamas attacks , with the crisis deeply dividing the Security Council . Israel voiced anger over the UN chief plea before a high level session of the Security Council , where the Palestinian foreign minister in turn denounced what he described as inaction in the conflict that has killed thousands on both sides , mostly civilians . Opening the session , Guterres said there was no excuse for the \" appalling \" violence by Hamas militants on October 7 but also warned against \" collective punishment \" of the Palestinians . \" I am deeply concerned about the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza . Let me be clear : No party to an armed conflict is above international humanitarian law , \" Guterres said , without explicitly naming Israel . Guterres also said that the Hamas attacks \" did not happen in a vacuum \" as the Palestinians have been \" subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation . \" His remarks infuriated Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen who , pointing his finger at Guterres and raising his voice , recounted graphic accounts of civilians including young children killed in the deadliest single attack in Israeli history . \" Mr Secretary General , in what world do you live ? \" Cohen said . Rejecting tying the violence to the occupation , Cohen said Israel gave Gaza to the Palestinians \" to the last millimetre \" with its withdrawal in 2005 . Israel shortly afterwards imposed a blockade of the impoverished territory , in place ever since , after Hamas took power , and it still occupies the West Bank . Israel ambassador to the United Nations , Gilad Erdan , called on Guterres to resign writing on X , formerly known as Twitter , that the UN chief has \" expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder . \" Epic suffering Hamas militants stormed into Israel on October 7 and attacked largely civilian targets including families and a music festival , killing at least people and taking more than 220 hostages , according to Israeli officials . More than Palestinians , also mostly civilians , have been killed across the Gaza Strip in retaliatory Israeli bombardments , the territory Hamas run health ministry said . Guterres , who personally travelled to the crossing between Egypt and Gaza in a push to let in assistance , welcomed the entry of three aid convoys so far through the Rafah crossing . But Guterres said it was \" a drop of aid in an ocean of need , \" as the UN agency for Palestinian refugees warned it would be forced to stop working Wednesday due to lack of fuel . \" To ease epic suffering , make the delivery of aid easier and safer , and facilitate the release of hostages , I reiterate my appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire . \" Israel , backed by the United States , has rejected calls to halt the offensive , saying it would only allow Hamas to regroup . New draft , new opposition The United States last week vetoed a draft resolution on the crisis , saying it did not sufficiently support Israel right to respond to Hamas . Secretary of State Antony Blinken asked the Security Council to back a new US led resolution that \" incorporates substantive feedback . \" The draft , seen by AFP , would defend the \" inherent right of all states \" to self defence while calling for compliance with international law . It would back \" humanitarian pauses \" to let in aid but not a full ceasefire . \" No member of this council no nation in this entire body could or would tolerate the slaughter of its people , \" Blinken said . Veto wielding Russia accustomed to being on the receiving end at the Security Council over its invasion of Ukraine quickly said it would oppose the US draft , which also came under criticism from US regional ally Egypt . \" We surprised by new attempts to adopt a resolution that does include any call for a ceasefire to prevent further deterioration of the situation which might lead the region to a dangerous juncture , \" Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said . Foreign minister Riyad al Maliki of the Palestinian Authority , run by Hamas rivals , called inaction by the Security Council \" inexcusable , \" as did Jordan , another US partner . \" The Security Council must take a clear stance to reassure two billion Arabs and Muslims that international law will be applied , \" Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said . Jordan and Russia are among nations that requested a meeting Thursday of the UN General Assembly , whose resolutions are non binding , due to the Security Council deadlock .',\n",

              " 'Antisemitism rises in Turkey during Israel Hamas war DW As the conflict between Israel and Hamas escalates , Turkey is witnessing a troubling increase in antisemitic sentiment , exacerbated mainly by media coverage and political discourse . The Jewish community in Turkey has raised concerns about rising antisemitism amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group . Karel Valansi , a columnist for the Turkish Jewish newspaper Salom and the news website , told DW that Jews are increasingly being associated with Israeli policies . \" What we see from the rhetoric of politicians , the press and social media is this : In the perception , Jews are completely removed from the position of citizens of the Republic of Turkey and turned into ambassadors and extensions of the state of Israel , and the anger against this state is directed toward Turkish Jews , \" Valansi said . According to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance , \" accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel , or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide , than to the interests of their own nations \" is a contemporary example of antisemitism . The US , Germany and more than 40 other governments have formally adopted or endorsed the IHRA definition of antisemitism . Gaza conflict could end fragile Israel Turkey rapprochement To view this video please enable JavaScript , and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports video Valansi also said antisemitic tendencies in public discourse , such as comments glorifying Adolf Hitler and Nazi ideologies , were resurfacing , causing a sense of insecurity among Jewish Turks . More than Israelis have died following the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas and allied groups , according to Israeli authorities . More than people have been killed in Gaza in Israeli strikes in the last three weeks , according to the Hamas run Health Ministry . Hamas has been designated a terror organization by the European Union , the US , Germany and other governments . Enmity and hatred As civilian deaths have amplified the tensions , some newspapers in Turkey have been accused of promoting a sense of war . \" There are newspapers that are almost shouting war cries , \" Faruk Bildirici , an independent ombudsman and media commentator who spent nine years as the readers representative of the national daily newspaper Hurriyet , told DW . Yeni Safak headlines : This Terror State Must Be Destroyed and The Ummah is Standing Image : Yeni Safak On October 18 , following the attack on the al Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza , the front page of the pro government daily Yeni Safak , a Turkish had the headlines : \" This Terror State Must Be Destroyed \" and \" The Ummah is Standing \" ummah refers to the global Muslim community . Bildirici raised concerns about framing the conflict as an interreligious war , noting this would further fuel animosity . Portraying \" what is going on as the ummah standing up means that the war is being viewed and portrayed as a war between the West and the East or between Islam and Christianity Judaism , \" Bildirici said . \" This fuels enmity and hatred against the West and Christianity Judaism . \" On October 17 , the pro government Islamist daily Yeni Akit targeted Jewish Turks with the front page headline \" Deport the Zionist Servants from Citizenship . \" Yeni Akit claimed that Jewish Turks are \" considered citizens of Israel by nature \" and , therefore , are going to Israel from cities such as Istanbul and Izmir to join the military service during the war . Avlaremoz , a news and opinion website focused on Jewish affairs and antisemitism in Turkey , criticized Yeni Akit for coverage that does not reflect the truth . Antisemitism spreads online Hashtags such as TürkiyeYahudileriVatandaşlıktanAtılsın Expel Turkish Jews from citizenship have arisen to target people who post about Israel . Jewish artists and writers , even those not active on social media , have faced criticism for not publicly supporting Palestine . The Jewish community within Turkey has broadly advocated for peace . In a statement released on October 18 , the Turkish Chief Rabbinate Foundation Turkish Jewish Community wrote : \" We strongly reject and condemn the targeting and killing of innocent civilians under any circumstances and wherever they are particularly in places like hospitals , schools and nursing homes . \" We support the efforts of our state , the Republic of Turkey , since the first day to urgently restore peace and wish that all people can be brought to a lasting peace as soon as possible . \" Antisemitism in politics Some Turkish politicians have also turned to antisemitism in their rhetoric . Addressing the Israel Hamas conflict during a meeting of the parliamentary group of his Justice and Development Party AKP on Wednesday , President Recep Tayyip Erdogan referred to Hamas as a \" group of mujahedeen , \" an Arabic meaning those fighting for Islam , rather than a terrorist organization . Erdogan also said he had canceled plans to visit Israel . AKP and opposition politicians alike have shown their support for Hamas since the conflict began . On Tuesday , Devlet Bahceli , the leader of the Nationalist Movement Party , another of Erdogan alliance partners , called on Turkey to intervene in the conflict militarily to protect Gaza if a cease fire can not be achieved within 24 hours . So far , there have been no large scale organized demonstrations in Turkey against the Israel Hamas conflict . However , riot control vehicles are waiting in front of the synagogues in Turkey for security purposes . After the hospital explosion in Gaza , different groups gathered in front of the Israeli consulate in Istanbul and the embassy residence in Ankara to protest . Some protesters in Istanbul shouted \" takbir , \" an Islamic chant that means \" God is the greatest , \" and broke through the outer walls of the plaza where the Israeli consulate was located . Turkish protesters in Ankara marched on October 18 holding a sign reading No to Genocide Image : Adem Altan AFP Getty Images AKP Istanbul branch announced that a \" Great Palestine Rally \" will be held on October 28 at Istanbul Ataturk Airport . Erdogan is expected to attend , as are the leaders of the parties in his ruling alliance . Turkish Jews as equal citizens Valansi said Jews were equal citizens who had contribute to Turkey development and cultural fabric . Valansi said despite their long history in Anatolia , Turkish Jews are sometimes perceived as outsiders , a notion at odds with their significant contributions to the country . \" The public understanding of citizenship in Turkey does not include non Muslims , \" Valansi said . \" Despite being one of the founding elements of the Republic , Jews are perceived as guests , as a community to be tolerated and expected to show constant gratitude . \" Most Jewish Turks reside in Istanbul . However , the increasing antisemitism has driven many to emigrate , including to Israel . A population that had stood at people nearly a century ago , according to 1927 census data , is now approximately , according to Turkey Jewish community .

              " 'JP Morgan upgrades India to overweight ; advises buying on dips After a 7 percent drop in the Indian market from its peak hit in mid September , global brokerage house JP Morgan has upgraded India to overweight from neutral . The brokerage has advised investors to use near term correction dip as an opportunity to add and leverage on a positive historical seasonality to general elections . It further noted that India offers the strongest emerging market EM nominal GDP compounding demographic trends , infrastructure investment needs and has competitive risk adjusted returns to developed market DM equities . A deeper domestic bond market should support lower risk premia , it added . The brokerage has also added Sun Pharma , Bank of Baroda , and Hindustan Unilever to its EM model portfolio . After a strong bull run earlier this year , the Indian market lost over 3 percent in October so far . This decline has been on the back of the Israel Palestine conflict , rising bond yields , a strong dollar , a surge in crude oil prices and continuous outflows by foreign investors . JP Morgan believes that EM equities face challenges as US long rates rise and the dollar impacts growth and rates . A sustainable bid for EM equities may only emerge once the US completes its cycle with a GDP recession and rate cuts , it stated . Before JP Morgan , other global brokerages , Morgan Stanley and Nomura , also upgraded their India ratings to overweight whereas CLSA increased its India portfolio allocation by 20 percent . Morgan Stanley upgraded India rating citing that the relative economic and earnings growth is improving and the macro stability setup looks sufficient to withstand the higher real rate environment . India remains standout overweight . We increase our overweight stance on Indian equities and as our most preferred emerging market , \" it said . Apart from this , Morgan Stanley said that the dream run of domestic flows continues and multipolar world dynamics are driving both FDI as well as portfolio flows towards the country , adding that the domestic equities top the brokerage global equity investment score with an overall score of 68 . Going ahead , MS expects the BSE Sensex to reach points by December . It said Sensex will trade at a price to earnings multiple of times compared to a 25 year average of 20 times . The premium over the historical average reflects greater confidence in medium term growth , noted the brokerage . Meanwhile , Nomura said , \" The structural story of India is now well known as a major beneficiary of the \" theme , possessing a large , liquid equity market . We see the recent softness driven by higher oil prices as an opportunity to raise exposure . While this weakness may persist in the near term , we think the window of opportunity might not be open for too long . Valuations are expensive but will likely remain so in a scenario of policy government continuity . \" Other countries JP Morgan also upgraded Saudi to overweight due to premium oil prices , uncertainty , a strong dollar , and equity market de rating . However , it downgraded South Korea to neutral due to profit taking , higher US rates , slowing demand , and less accommodative monetary policy . Moreover , it mentioned that it plans to allocate its risk budget to overweight China , in addition to Saudi and India , due to attractive growth momentum , low investor positioning , and favorable valuations . \" Exciting news !

              " 'Chinese Control Over Disputed Bhutanese Territory Could Imperil Bharat National Security Any successful Chinese Bhutanese rapprochement that results in Thimphu ceding Doklam to Beijing would have both military and political consequences for India , but there little that Delhi can do to stop it since such a deal would be between sovereign states . In that scenario , Sino Indo relations would likely deteriorate even further and faster than before if Beijing feels emboldened by its newfound edge over the Siliguri Corridor to redouble its claims to Arunachal Pradesh . China and Bhutan appear to be on the brink of formally establishing relations after their Foreign Ministers meeting in Beijing on Monday . The first said that it ready to resolve their long running border dispute while the second pledged to uphold the one China principle and praised his host Global Development , Security , and Civilization Initiatives . The Chinese Bhutanese rapprochement is mutually beneficial , but it could have serious implications for India as will be explained in this piece . That South Asian Great Power is concerned that any resolution of those two border dispute that results in Chinese control over the Doklam Plateau known as Donglang by Beijing could give the People Republic the military edge over India in the event of another war between them . This slice of territory overlooks the Siliguri Corridor connecting Mainland India with the Seven Sisters , which is only 12 14 miles wide at its narrowest point , hence why it nicknamed the Chicken Neck . India dispatched troops to Bhutan in summer 2017 to stop China construction of a road in this disputed region in accordance with its decades long defense cooperation with that Kingdom , which objected to what it claimed at the time to be Beijing unilateral change of the status quo . Although the crisis ended with mutual de escalation measures , it set the stage for the lethal Sino Indo clashes that broke out three years later in the disputed Galwan River Valley , and their ties were never the same after that . Each consequently regards the other as a rival , which has greatly impeded their cooperation in multipolar fora like BRICS and the SCO despite their shared Russian strategic partner best efforts to bridge their differences or at least decelerate the pace at which they continue widening . Another Sino Indo war therefore ca be ruled out even though neither wants this to happen , but it could still occur by miscalculation owing to their tense security dilemma that only worsened over the past year . China continues to claim the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh on the basis that it constitutes South Tibet , hence Delhi concerns that the Seven Sisters could once again be the scene of fighting if another war breaks out . In that scenario , China could threaten India supply lines through the Siliguri Corridor from Doklam , and it ca be taken for granted that Bangladesh would allow India transit rights . Even if it did , anti Indian elements could organize crippling protests and even attack those convoys . These calculations explain why India militarily intervened in Bhutan support to stop the construction of a Chinese road in disputed Doklam over half a decade ago , and it precisely because they remain enduring that India is so concerned about the possibility of Bhutan potentially ceding Doklam to China . Considering that China reaffirmed its claims to that region as recently as August after the publication of its annual map , there no reason to expect that it drop its request for the plateau cession . In the event that Bhutan swaps that territory with China in exchange for Beijing recognition of Thimphu sovereignty over other disputed parts of their border , then India would be placed in a difficult position . China resultant military edge over the Siliguri Corridor could embolden it to double down on claims to Arunachal Pradesh , which could be pushed to pressure India to drop its own claims elsewhere along their disputed border in exchange for Chinese recognition of India control over that state . The optics of China pressuring India in such a way could also be exploited by the latter opposition to portray the BJP as weak ahead of next spring elections , especially if they spin Bhutan potential cession of Doklam as the latest domino to fall after the Maldives just elected a pro Chinese leader . Coupled with the possibility of the Indian friendly Bangladeshi government being deposed after next January elections , this narrative might become more compelling to a larger number of voters by then . Viewed from this perspective , any successful Chinese Bhutanese rapprochement that results in Thimphu ceding Doklam to Beijing would have both military and political consequences for India , but there little that Delhi can do to stop it since such a deal would be between sovereign states . In that scenario , Sino Indo relations would likely deteriorate even further and faster than before if Beijing feels emboldened by its newfound edge over the Siliguri Corridor to redouble its claims to Arunachal Pradesh . There are three reasons to expect that the People Republic might pursue the aforesaid course of action upon obtaining control over Doklam . First , China wants to discredit India self described role as the Voice of the Global South by pressuring developing countries to choose sides between them if another crisis breaks out . Many of them might back Beijing solely because it their top trade partner and they do want to risk getting on its bad side , which would thus undermine Delhi claims of leadership . The second reason concerns China desire to resolve the western half of its border dispute with India on favorable terms to Beijing by leveraging a crisis over Arunachal Pradesh to that end as was explained . China could redouble its claims to that region in order to pressure India into agreeing to a compromise whereby Beijing drops these selfsame claims in exchange for India dropping its own over the Chinese controlled part of Ladakh that Beijing calls Aksai Chin . This is risky , however , and might backfire . That brings everything around to the last reason why China might redouble its claims to that region if it obtains control over Doklam since it could be that the People Republic wants to shape the narrative that the BJP is weak ahead of next spring elections as punishment for refusing to compromise on their dispute . What so dangerous about this is that the ruling party might respond more forcefully than China expects , which could lead to another lethal clash or even a war in the worst case scenario . Neither China nor India wants to fight one another once again , but the former control over Doklam could be perceived by the latter as a game changer that either force it into compromising against its ruling party will or contemplating preemptive military action , thus worsening their security dilemma . China does want war since that play into the US claims that it part of a new axis of evil , while India ca rely on US support if need be since it already overstretched supporting Ukraine and Israel . Nevertheless , the further deterioration of their ties that expected in the event that China obtains control over Doklam as part of its ongoing rapprochement with Bhutan means that these concerns are disturbingly credible , which is why everyone should closely follow the interplay between those three . Amidst the NATO Russian proxy war in Ukraine and the latest Israeli Hamas war , another Sino Indo war could throw the world into complete chaos , which is why it should be avoided if at all possible .

              " 'US Strikes 2 Iran Backed Militia Facilities In Syria , Confirms Pentagon US Strikes 2 Iran Backed Militia Facilities In Syria , Confirms Pentagon The US has confirmed that it struck two Iran backed militia facilities in Syria . This strike comes after the rise in attacks against US forces deployed in the Middle East . Updated Oct 27 , 2023 AM IST US Strikes 2 Iran backed Militia Facilities in Syria , confirms Pentagon Photo : AP Washington DC : The United States has stated that it struck two Iran backed militia facilities in Syria . The airstrikes have been confirmed by the Pentagon today . US Defence Secretary Llyod Austin stated the strikes were carried out after a series of drone and rocket attacks were witnessed against US Forces in the Middle East . As per the official statement issued by the Defence Secretary , the facilities have been used by Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC and other affiliated groups . As per CNN , Austin described US actions as \" narrowly tailored in self defence \" . The Defence Secretary further elaborated that these strikes were not part of the Israel Gaza conflict but due to a different concern of the US . Since October 17 , US forces deployed in the Middle East have been subject to various drone and rocket attacks at the hands of militant groups such as the Houthis , which are backed by Iran . In Iraq , American forces have been attacked around 12 times and around four times in Syria . These strikes carried out as a response to these attacks . Austin has accused Iran of being directly involved in the attacks against US forces . \" Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces . We will not let them , \" stated the Defence Secretary . Earlier on Thursday , the US government also announced that it will deploy around 900 troops in the Middle East and may increase the amount in the coming future . Under President Joe Biden , the United States has carried out strikes against militias before . However , this strike comes at a time when tensions are already high in the Middle East . The US is working towards sending a strong message to Iran and the militant groups backed by them . The aim of this message is to warn Tehran to not escalate tensions in the region .',\n",
              " 'THAAD Thunders In The Middle East ! To Join Patriot Systems To Repeal Possible Iran Attacks The Pentagon has announced that the US is dispatching a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense THAAD system and additional Patriot air defense missile system battalions to the Middle East in response to the latest attacks on its troopers . Since the United States started moving its military assets to the region , beginning with the world largest aircraft carrier , USS Gerard Ford , it has emphasized that the deployment is meant to prevent escalation . With Israel hinting it is set to launch a ground invasion of Gaza , Washington fears a much bigger regional conflict . The concerns of a wider regional conflict are conflated with the Lebanon based Hezbollah group launching sporadic attacks on Israel , with the latter warning that the militant group Iran allegedly supports risks dragging Beirut into the conflict . The Israel Defense Forces IDF conducted overnight air strikes on Southern Lebanon on October 22 . Over three weeks after the Hamas attacks on October 7 that killed Israelis , including women and children , the IDF has incessantly carried out bombing runs on the Gaza Strip , reducing the densely populated city to rubble and killing people in the enclave . With the Jewish State pledging to decimate Hamas , the IDF has amassed tanks and troops near the fenced border for a planned ground invasion that is speculated to begin soon . The imminent ground operation has triggered fears of an all out regional conflict that could see countries like Iran becoming a party . The decision to deliver these weapons , particularly the THAAD battery , to Israel is part of a more extensive operation to position much more firepower in the region if Iran or its proxies intervene in the battle against Hamas and Hezbollah . That the United States feels most threatened by Iran and its proxies in the region became evident through Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin statement detailing the deployment . Austin said , Following detailed discussions with President Biden on recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces across the Middle East region , I directed a series of additional steps to strengthen the Department of Defense posture in the area today . These steps will bolster regional deterrence efforts , increase force protection for US forces in the region , and assist in the defense of Israel . I have also activated the deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense THAAD battery and additional Patriot battalions throughout the region to increase force protection for the US forces . To add to the prevailing precarious situation in the Middle East , the US troops came under a spate of attacks last week . Several US positions in Iraq and Syria were attacked by drones , with some of its forces sustaining minor injuries . One contractor died of a cardiac arrest while taking shelter from these attacks . : On 19 , the Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer USS Carney DDG 64 took out multiple Houthi missiles unmanned aerial vehicles in the Red Sea . Carney is deployed to the AOR to help ensure maritime security stability . Naval Forces Central Command Fleet October 21 , 2023 Also , earlier , an Arleigh Burke class destroyer , USS Carney , was reported to have shot down four land attack cruise missiles and 19 drones launched from Yemen and headed to the Red Sea . The Iran backed Houthi group in Yemen is believed to have fired the missiles and launched the drones to target Israel . These incidents make the US THAAD and Patriot air defense systems deployment in the Middle East significant . For perspective , THAAD aims to intercept ballistic missiles as they leave the midcourse phase of their flight and approach their targets later in their attack profiles . It supplements the Patriot upper layer anti ballistic missile defense system in many theatres since it can intercept more powerful , swifter , and farther flying ballistic missiles at longer ranges . The THAAD is in operation in the United Arab Emirates UAE and was used for the first time last year . Besides the THAAD and Patriots , the United States has sent significant naval power to the Middle East in recent weeks , including two aircraft carriers , their auxiliary ships , and about Marines . This has been touted as the most significant build up in the region in recent years . On its part , Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian has warned Israel fiercely that failure to halt its bombardment of Gaza could result in an uncontrollable situation in the Middle East . Iran has maintained the position that the US was to blame for providing military aid to Israel . Against this backdrop of intense military activity in the region , Iran has also upped its force projection by amplifying new capabilities and issuing fierce warnings to its age old rivals , Israel and the United States . This includes arming a cutting edge drone with lethal missiles . Iranian Drone Equipped With A Brand New Air Missile Amid tensions running high in the region , the Iranian Air Defense Force commander , Brigadier General Alireza Sabahi Fard , announced on October 21 that experts have modified a domestic surface to air missile for use with the Karrar jet powered drone . Brigadier General Alireza Sabahi Fard stated that the Air Defense Force has successfully fitted the Karrar drone with a Majid heat seeking air to air missile with an 8 kilometer range , Tehran Times reported . He informed the media that after eighteen months of study and testing , the Air Defense experts converted the Majid surface to air missile into an air based weapon through a series of technological modifications . According to the commander , the Karrar drone was equipped with a Majid missile , which could explode several airborne targets with its warhead . The drone , on its part , has several feathers to its cap already that the Iranian military has made a point to highlight . Karrar is the first Iranian military drone and has surpassed the record for the highest service ceiling at feet . The primary purpose of the contemporary Iranian jet drone Karrar is to intercept enemy aircraft . It also known as an advanced interceptor drone at times . It enables the country armed forces to execute a more excellent range of high altitude air defense tasks . Iran is testing UAVs with air to air missiles . The use of the Majid missile with a range of 8 10 km against air targets from the Karrar UAV . Clash Report October 22 , 2023 The drone has already sent radio and radar alerts to foreign planes approaching Iran flight information region FIR or its shoreline waters . Last month , the deputy commander of Iran Air Defense Force , Alireza Elhami , said that the jet powered drone has forced foreign manned and unmanned aircraft to change their course at high altitudes over the Persian Gulf , the Strait of Hormuz and the Sea of Oman , on multiple occasions . Karrar has warned the US military Boeing Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft as well as Northrop Grumman Global Hawk remotely piloted surveillance aircraft and made them keep their distance from the Iranian airspace by flying at very high altitudes above the intruders , Brigadier General Elhami added . Previously , Sabahi Fard stressed that the Air Defense Force of Iran possesses excellent military capabilities that are unmatched in the West Asian region . When referring to Saddam Hussein war against Iran , General Sabahi Fard said that the armed forces repelled the invasion for eight years using weapons that all were bought from abroad , and we were utterly dependent . But today , the powerful air defense force of the Army has the most advanced and adequate indigenous equipment in the fields of detection , interception , conflict , and information systems in the world . As fears of tensions linger , Iran military has focused on bolstering its air defense capabilities and building deterrence , preparing for hostilities with its adversaries .',\n",

              " 'Israel expects long ground war in Gaza to destroy Hamas and its many tunnels DEIR AL BALAH , Gaza Strip AP Israel expects to launch a long and difficult ground offensive into Gaza soon to destroy Hamas , the country defense minister said Friday , describing a campaign that will require dismantling a vast network of tunnels used by the territory militant rulers . Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke to a small group of foreign reporters in Tel Aviv after Israeli forces backed by fighter jets and drones carried out a second , limited ground raid into Gaza in as many days , striking the outskirts of Gaza City . Gallant said the ground invasion that follows weeks of airstrikes will take a long time , and that it would lead to another lengthy phase of lower intensity fighting , as Israel destroys pockets of resistance . In a sign of rising tensions in the region , warplanes struck targets in eastern Syria that the Pentagon said were linked to Iran Revolutionary Guard after a string of attacks on American forces , and two mysterious objects hit towns in Egypt Sinai Peninsula . After three weeks of war sparked by a bloody Hamas incursion into southern Israel , the Palestinian death toll has soared past , according to officials in Gaza . A blockade on Gaza has meant dwindling supplies of food , fuel , water and medicine , and and Arab leaders have called for a cease fire to allow entry of humanitarian aid that is only trickling in . Gaza Health Ministry on Thursday released a detailed list of names and identification numbers of those killed , including more than minors and more than women . More than people were slain in Israel during Hamas 7 attack , according to the Israeli government , and at least 229 hostages were taken into Gaza . Palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel , including one that hit a residential building in Tel Aviv on Friday , wounding four people . The overall number of deaths far exceeds the combined toll of all four previous wars between Israel and Hamas , estimated at around . A ground invasion is expected to cause even higher casualties on both sides as Israeli forces and Hamas battle each other in dense residential areas . Hospitals have been scrounging for fuel to run emergency generators that power incubators and other life saving equipment after Israel cut off all fuel deliveries to Gaza at the start of the war , forcing its only power plant to shut down . Gallant said Israel believes that Hamas would confiscate any fuel that enters . He said Hamas uses generators to pump air into its hundreds of kilometers miles of tunnels , which originate in civilian areas . He showed reporters aerial footage of what he said was a tunnel shaft built right next to a hospital . For air , they need oil . For oil , they need us , he said . Little is known about Hamas secretive tunnels and other infrastructure , and it was possible to independently confirm Gallant claims . Lynne Hastings , the aid coordinator for the Palestinian territories , declined to comment on Gallant remarks , saying we do know what Hamas has or does have . We have been bringing fuel into Gaza in coordination with the government of Israel for decades . We know fuel is a high risk item and are working with the Israelis to make sure what we will be using for our operations is done securely , she said . The agency for Palestinian refugees , which provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza , said it has been forced to ration fuel among lifesaving machines in hospitals , bakeries , and desalination plants , and only has enough for a few more days . The siege means that food , water and fuel basic commodities are being used to collectively punish more than 2 million people , among them , a majority of children and women , Philippe Lazzarini , the head of UNRWA , told reporters . Earlier on Friday , the military said ground forces raided inside Gaza , striking dozens of militant targets over the past 24 hours . It said aircraft and artillery bombed targets in Shijaiyah , a neighborhood on Gaza City outskirts that was the scene of an urban battle in the 2014 Gaza war . The military said the soldiers exited the territory without suffering any casualties . It reported an earlier , hourslong raid into northern Gaza on Thursday . The damage to Gaza from nearly three weeks of bombardment showed in satellite photos of several locations taken before the war and again in recent days . Entire rows of residential buildings simply disappear in the photos , reduced to smears of dust and rubble . The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses Hamas of operating among civilians in an attempt to protect its fighters . The conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region . Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that the Friday strikes in eastern Syria were a response to ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against personnel in Iraq and Syria over the past 10 days . He said the operation was separate from the Israel Hamas war . Hezbollah , an Iranian backed ally of Hamas in Lebanon , has repeatedly traded fire with Israel along the border , and Israel has carried out airstrikes targeting Iran linked groups in Syria . The United States has sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region , along with additional weaponry and personnel , in part to deter Iran and its allies from entering the war . Egypt military meanwhile said a drone crashed into a building in the Red Sea town of Taba , on the border with Israel , slightly wounding six people . In a separate incident , the state run Al Qahera news said a strange object landed near a power station in the Red Sea town of Nuweiba , further south . Footage showed debris and smoke rising from the side of a nearby mountain . Last week , a Navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched toward Israel by Iran backed Houthi rebels in northern Yemen . About million of Gaza million residents have fled their homes , with nearly half of them crowding into shelters . Hundreds of thousands remain in northern Gaza , despite Israel ordering them to evacuate to the south and saying that those who remain might be considered accomplices of Hamas . Over the past week , Israel has allowed more than 80 trucks with aid enter from Egypt through the Rafah crossing , the only entry point into Gaza not controlled by Israel . But aid workers say the convoys meet only a tiny fraction of the territory mounting humanitarian needs . Before the war , an average of 500 trucks entered Gaza each day , according to the United Nations . The Palestinian Red Crescent said on social media that it had received 10 trucks of food , medicine and other supplies had passed through Rafah on Friday morning . The has been working with other mediators to send in more humanitarian aid , but Israel is insisting on strict screening procedures for all trucks that enter . Hundreds of foreign passport holders are trying to leave Gaza , but the says Hamas has refused to allow that . Federman reported from Tel Aviv and Mroue from Beirut . Najib Jobain in Rafah , Gaza Strip , Jack Jeffery in Cairo , Isabel DeBre in Jerusalem , and Brian Melley in London , contributed to this report .',\n",

On Tuesday , Guterres addressed a special Security Council meeting on the Israel Hamas war that was sparked by the militant group attack , which left at least Israelis dead , and more than 220 taken hostage . The chief told the council that he condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel . Nothing can justify the deliberate killing , injuring and kidnapping of civilians or the launching of rockets against civilian targets , he said . But his contextualization of the attack created an uproar in Israel . It was important , Guterres said , to acknowledge that the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum . The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation . They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence ; their economy stifled ; their people displaced and their homes demolished . Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing , he said . On Wednesday , Guterres tried to walk back the comments , tweeting : The grievances of the Palestinian people can not justify the horrific attacks by Hamas . Those horrendous attacks can not justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people . But Israel was not mollified . The slaughter of Jew by Hamas on October was genocidal in its intents and immeasurably brutal in its form , Yad Vashem Chairman Dani Dayan said in a statement . He said that it tests the sincerity of world leaders who came to Yad Vashem and pledged Never Again .

              " 'Israeli Troops Cross Into Gaza For Limited Raids On Hamas Sites Ahead Of Ground Attack TEL AVIV : In a significant development , the Israel Defense Forces IDF initiated a limited ground operation in Gaza overnight , deploying infantry forces and tanks in the northern part of the Strip . This \" targeted raid \" marks a crucial step in the escalating conflict between Israel and the Hamas terror group . It serves as preparation for the forthcoming full scale ground offensive , which Israeli officials have vowed to execute , reported the Times Of israel . Several Hamas Sites Hit By IDF The IDF operation , led by the Givati infantry brigade and the Armored Division , was focused on preparing the border area for the \" next stages of the war , \" which refers to the imminent full ground offensive . During the operation , Israeli troops struck numerous terrorists , targeted infrastructure , and disabled anti tank guided missile launch positions . The objective was to secure the battlefield for future ground operations . IDF Spokesman Rear Daniel Hagari confirmed that the operation lasted a few hours and that no Israeli soldiers were harmed . He stated that the raid aimed to eliminate terrorists , neutralize threats , dismantle explosives , and neutralize ambushes to facilitate subsequent ground operations . This ground incursion surpassed the near daily \" localized raids \" that Israeli soldiers had been conducting along the border . These localized efforts primarily focused on searching for missing Israelis and clearing explosives left behind by Hamas terrorists since the October 7 attack . Israel has articulated its mission as destroying Hamas infrastructure and dismantling the organization following the October 7 attacks while minimizing harm to Gaza civilian population . In preparation for the next stages of combat , the IDF operated in northern Gaza . IDF tanks infantry struck numerous terrorist cells , infrastructure and anti tank missile launch posts . The soldiers have since exited the area and returned to Israeli territory . Israel Defense Forces October 26 , 2023 Rise In Rocket Attack From Hamas The recent conflict , led by Hamas and other terror groups , saw around terrorists infiltrate Israel from the Gaza Strip , resulting in numerous casualties . Thousands of rockets were launched at Israeli towns and cities during this assault . Gaza Evacuation The IDF has been urging Palestinian residents to evacuate the northern Gaza area as it intensifies strikes in preparation for a major ground offensive . In the past day , Israeli jets targeted over 250 sites belonging to Hamas , including infrastructure , command centers , tunnels , and rocket launchers . Navy forces also struck a Hamas surface to air missile launch position situated near a mosque and kindergarten . Rising Casualty It important to note that casualty figures are disputed , with Gaza Hamas run health ministry reporting deaths , mainly civilians , including many children . These figures are difficult to independently verify and are believed to include Hamas terrorists and gunmen killed in both Israel and Gaza . Delay In Gaza Ground Offensive The full ground offensive into Gaza has experienced delays due to tactical and strategic considerations . Israel agreement to temporarily delay the operation was influenced by the United States , which sought additional time to deploy air defence systems and engage in internationally brokered negotiations with Hamas regarding the release of hostages . As Israel prepares for a ground offensive , troops will face the daunting task of navigating Gaza network of tunnels , booby traps , and urban combat . PM Confirms Gaza Ground Invasion Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the impending ground incursion while withholding specific details on timing and strategy , emphasizing the need to protect soldiers lives and citing unanimous decision making among officials . He stated that the offensive aims to destroy Hamas and secure the release of hostages , referring to members of the terror group as \" dead men walking . \"',\n",
              " 'US Accused of War Crimes in Gaza UNITED NATIONS : The widespread use of American weapons by Israel , which has killed thousands of civilians in Gaza , has triggered accusations of war crimes against the United States . But the US has always escaped these charges in contemporary military conflicts particularly in the killing fields of Afghanistan and Iraq and also in the use of American weapons in Yemen where thousands have been killed . The United Nations once described the deaths and destruction in the eight year old civil war in Yemen as the world worst humanitarian disaster . The killings of mostly civilians have been estimated at over , with accusations of war crimes against a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates UAE , whose primary arms supplier is the US . And now , the killings of Palestinians in Gaza have come back to haunt the Americans in a new war zone . But still , the US is unlikely to be hauled before the International Criminal Court ICC . If officials do care about Palestinian civilians facing atrocities using weapons , perhaps they will care a bit more about their own individual criminal liability for aiding Israel in carrying out these atrocities , said Sarah Leah Whitson , executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now DAWN , an American non profit organization that advocates democracy and human rights in the Middle East . The American people never signed up to help Israel commit war crimes against defenseless civilians with taxpayer funded bombs and artillery , she noted . According to DAWN , law requires that the United States monitor and ensure that weapons and munitions it provides to Israel are not used to commit war crimes in Gaza . The advocacy group reminded both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III in a letter sent last week . Failure to comply with end use monitoring requirements not only breaches laws but also could expose officials to prosecution by the International Criminal Court ICC for aiding and abetting war crimes , warned DAWN . In a separate letter to ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan , DAWN asked the Prosecutor urgently to issue a public statement reminding the parties to the conflict of the ongoing investigation there and send an investigative team to the Gaza region of Palestine to document and investigate potential crimes under the Rome Statute . Mouin Rabbani , Co Editor , Jadaliyya , an independent ezine produced by the Arab Studies Institute , told IPS the United States is in violation of international law , as well as its own domestic legislation , by providing weapons to Israel in the full knowledge that these are being used for the express purpose of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity . I would go further and state that it is providing them to Israel for precisely this reason . This is because the US is determined to see Israel achieve its objectives in the Gaza Strip ; Washington recognizes that Israel does not have the military capacity and political will to physically occupy the Gaza Strip for a prolonged period and eradicate Hamas and other groups , and has instead with unqualified US support adopted as its primary objective the systematic destruction of the Gaza Strip and mass killings of Palestinian civilians , he pointed out . As for international law and domestic US legislation , these are as irrelevant as Palestinian lives in this context . That how the US designed rules based international order works and was designed to work , he said . US legislation , the laws of war , and international law more generally , are rigorously applied to rivals and adversaries , while the US and its partners are free to violate them with total impunity , Rabbani argued . It would be fair to say that ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan is the personification of this system fearlessly prosecuting official enemies and adversaries with rabid zeal , but more docile than a dead canary when similar or greater crimes are committed by states his government and its Western partners support without qualification , said Rabbani . If there one thing US officials complicit in Israel war crimes do have to worry about , it is prosecution by the ICC , he declared . Asked about US weapons in killings in Gaza , Matthew Miller , Spokesperson for the State Department told reporters last week that American weapons can not be deliberately used against civilians . Of course and one of the tragedies of war is that there are always civilian deaths . It is one of the great tragedies of war , and what we try to do is work to minimize civilian deaths to the greatest extent possible , he said . Asked if there is any concern among the administration that by supplying this military assistance , the US might be involved in any possible war crimes against civilians , Miller said : No , I would say that we have made very clear that we expect Israel to conduct its operations in compliance with international law . That is the standard we hold uphold that the standard we hold ourselves to ; it the standard we hold our partners to ; it the standard every democracy ought to be held to . And we will continue to work with them and continue to deliver messages to them that they should conduct their military operations in and to the maximum extent possible to protect civilians from harm , he declared . According to the Washington based Stimson Center , Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of military assistance since the Second World War , amounting to more than 158 billion over the past seven decades not adjusted for inflation . In recent years , assistance to Israel has been outlined in a 10 year memoranda of understandings , the most recent of which was signed in 2016 and pledges 38 billion in military assistance between . Dr Ramzy Baroud , Palestinian journalist and author , told IPS asking the US to clarify the End Use Monitoring EUM measures , or Israel compliance with the use of American weapons in its war against Gaza , may give the impression that Washington lacks awareness of how US weapons , and US tax payers money are being used . Never before in the history of the US relationship with the Middle East has Washington been so directly involved in an Israeli war . The closest was the 1973 war , and even then , the US involvement arrived a week later , and was hardly as direct , he said . Every statement made by top US officials , starting with Biden , to Blinken to Sullivan , to all others , indicate that the US is a party in the war , not an outsider , a benefactor , and certainly not a mediator . They even sat in on meetings to discuss Israeli war plans on Gaza . They can not claim ignorance , Dr , Baroud pointed out . In the past , Israel has violated the US rules on the use of US arms against civilians , and repeatedly so . Much has been written about this subject , particularly in terms of Israeli violation of the Lehy Laws . But what is happening right now is a whole different reality . By sending massive arm shipments , aircraft carriers , and even soldiers to Israel , the US has become a party in the world , therefore it is responsible for the unprecedented war crimes in Gaza , he argued . The fingerprints of US weapons are on the body of every Palestinian killed in Gaza , from the Al Ahli Baptist Hospital , to UN schools , to every house and every street . We do demand clarification regarding the use of these weapons . We know precisely how they are being used . We demand accountability from war criminals , whether in Tel Aviv or Washington , he noted . Meanwhile , a report on Cable News Network CNN October 22 said the death toll in Gaza since October 7 has risen to , with more than wounded , according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza .

              " 'Higher for longer interest era : The Indian outlook MUMBAI : At the recently concluded International Monetary Fund Bank meetings in Marrakesh , officials fretted over the new trend of interest rates remaining high for a long period . Mint looks at how it will impact the world at large and India in particular . View Full Image Graphic : Mint What is the higher for longer regime ? Central banks across the world have raised interest rates over the last 18 months or more to battle runaway inflation . The increase was more than 500 basis points bps in advanced economies and in excess of 650 bps in emerging markets . However , the battle against inflation is far from over . Core inflation in the US and many parts of Europe continues to remain high . The IMF , in its latest World Economic Outlook , does not expect inflation to return to within target levels until 2025 in most economies . This will necessitate keeping interest rates higher for a longer period of time . Why is this trend worrying ? Experts feel the global economy , which is just emerging from the pandemic , may not be prepared to handle high interest rates . Most countries have piled up huge debts and lower income countries are particularly stressed . The banking system is under pressure with many US banks needing a bailout . The higher cost of borrowings will hurt the beleaguered property sector further . Household savings across the world are dropping and delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans are on the rise in some markets . IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva has warned of a multidimensional threat to stability . What does the end to free money mean ? Before March 2022 , when the US Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates , the borrowing cost was almost zero . Many countries kept rates at that level to fuel economic growth . Experts say the policy led to tepid growth and low productivity . While higher interest rates will slow growth , they feel it will lead to a fairer and more productive world economy . How will this impact the world economy ? It is slowing down the world economy . The IMF pegs global economic growth at 3 for 2023 as against in 2022 . As the full effect of the tightening monetary policy and higher interest rates kicks in , it expects growth to slow to in 2024 . This is much lower than the average economic growth between 2000 and 2019 . In fact , the medium term growth forecast of is the lowest in decades . Rising geopolitical flare ups , the latest being the Israel Palestine conflict , adds more risk to global growth . What impact will it have on India ? Despite the overall gloom , the IMF recently revised India growth upward to making it the fastest growing large economy . But the higher for longer interest rate scenario has the potential to disrupt this growth . It is already increasing the bond yields in the US . This could trigger a portfolio outflow from India . If that happens , the rupee will slide . A weaker rupee will make imports costly , driving up inflation . This could force the Reserve Bank of India to raise interest rates and that could slow down growth .',\n",

              " 'This is a massacre GAZA CITY AFP Gazans combed through the debris of the devastated hospital , collecting the bodies of the dead in the battered enclave on Wednesday , hours after a strike killed hundreds sheltering at the facility . Alongside rows of charred vehicles , volunteers recovered corpses and limbs that were placed in body bags , while the remains of others were covered in white shrouds and blankets . This is a massacre , Ahmed Tafesh , who assisted in the recovery effort , told AFP , saying he had collected the eyes , arms , legs and heads of the deceased . I have never seen anything like this in my life . Health authorities in Hamas ruled Gaza said the explosion killed 471 people at the Ahli Arab Hospital and was caused by an Israeli air strike , one of the thousands it has launched in retaliation for the group bloody October 7 attack on communities near the enclave . Israel has denied responsibility and blamed a faulty militant rocket . At the nearby Shifa hospital in Gaza City , residents gathered to identify the dead at the hospital mortuary and take other bodies for burial . Yahya Karim , 70 , was among those searching for clues about the fate of his relatives . after Israeli bombardment in Khan Yunis . PHOTO : AFP I do know how many of them died and how many are still alive , said Karim , admitting that he had planned to shelter in the hospital before the strike . Outside the Ahli hospital , others who survived the attack who spoke to AFP recounted the terrifying moment when the strike hit . We felt there was fire and things were falling on us . We started looking for each other . The electricity cut suddenly , and we could see , said Fatima Saed through tears . I do know how we came out of it . Gaza resident Adnan al Naqa told AFP that around people were taking refuge at the hospital on Tuesday night at the time of the strike . As I entered the hospital , I heard the explosion , I saw a massive fire , said Naqa . The entire square was on fire , there were bodies everywhere , children , women and elderly people . With water and food supplies running low , the United Nations estimates that around one million of Gaza million residents are currently displaced , with thousands sheltering in hospitals dotted throughout the densely populated enclave . As residents surveyed the damage , Israel and Palestinian militants traded blame for the strike . On Wednesday morning , the Israeli military offered what it said was evidence that extremist militants were responsible for the blast , saying a review of the strike proved others were at fault . The evidence which we are sharing with you all confirms that the explosion at the hospital in Gaza was caused by an Islamic Jihad rocket that misfired , military spokesman Daniel Hagari told a press conference in Tel Aviv . There was no IDF Israeli army fire by land , sea or air that hit the hospital , Hagari said . United States US President Joe Biden threw his support behind Israel account of the strike , telling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu it appears as though it was done by the other team after landing in Israel for a high stakes solidarity visit . Hamas fired back at the comments from the Israeli military , saying its outrageous lies do not deceive anyone . Footage verified by AFP shows a large fire burning at the hospital , while ambulance sirens and some explosions can be heard in the background . Aerial shots subsequently taken by AFP on Wednesday show the hospital buildings all still standing but damaged , with a small round crater in the courtyard . A damaged wheelchair , bags and other personal items were left on a patch of grass . Israel Arab allies blamed it for the hospital deaths , despite the military denials . The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain , which both established ties with Israel in the Abraham Accords of 2020 , condemned Israel for the blast . Morocco , another country that recognised Israel in 2020 , also blamed it for the strike , as did Egypt , which became the first Arab country to normalise relations in 1979 . As the two sides pinned blame on each other , Israeli air strikes continued to batter the war torn enclave , sending residents running for cover early on Wednesday . For 12 days , Israel has carried out a withering bombardment of the Gaza Strip in retaliation for the killing of people who were shot , mutilated or burnt to death in shock border attacks launched by Hamas on October 7 . More than people have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israeli air strikes , according to health officials .',\n",
              " 'Advancing India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor potential reason behind Hamas attack : Biden US President Joe Biden said that he is convinced that the intercontinental connectivity project , India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor , announced in September during the Summit in New Delhi , is one of the reasons why Hamas launched an attack on Israel on October 7 that left over people dead . The counteroffensive from Israel into Hamas governed Gaza Strip has left over Palestinians dead , a toll heavier than years of conflict combined . The project aims to integrate the entire region with a network of railroad . The project to , from , and between India , the United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia , Jordan , Israel , and Europe aims to provide a \" reliable and cost effective cross border ship to rail transit network to supplement existing maritime and road transport routes \" , according to a Memorandum of Understanding signed during the summit . Biden told journalists while standing beside the visiting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese that his analysis is based on his instinct and does not have any proof . \" I am convinced one of the reasons Hamas attacked when they did , and I have no proof of this , just my instinct tells me , is because of the progress we were making towards regional integration for Israel , and regional integration overall . We ca leave that work behind , \" Biden said . This is the second time in less than a week that Biden has mentioned the India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor IMEEC as a potential reason for the terrorist attack by Hamas . Earlier on October 20 , Biden , in an address from the Oval Office after his wartime Israel visit , hailed the India Middle East Europe economic corridor as a project that is aimed at building a \" better future for the Middle East \" , and the one that will make West Asia \" more stable , better connected to its neighbours \" . Biden said that with the \" innovative projects such as India Middle East Europe economic corridor that we announced earlier this year in the summit of the world biggest economies \" , the region will benefit with \" predictable markets , more employment , less rage and less grievances . \" \" It benefits the people of the Middle East . It benefits us the United States . \" The new economic corridor , which many see as an alternative to China Belt and Road Initiative , was jointly announced by the leaders of the US , India , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , France , Germany , Italy and the European Union on the sidelines of the summit in September . The corridor comprises an eastern corridor connecting India to the Gulf region and a northern corridor connecting the Gulf region to Europe . Israel Hamas war : What to make of Biden comments on IMEC ? According to an MoU signed between the countries during the New Delhi summit , the countries had agreed to \" commit to an action plan with relevant timetables \" within 60 days after September 9 . The attack by Hamas against Israel on October 7 falls right in the middle of this timeline . An intercontinental connectivity project , added with potential rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia after landmark restoration of ties between Israel , UAE and Bahrain , would have derailed Hamas purported goals in relation to the Israel Palestine issue . Biden said that in the past few weeks , he has spoken to leaders throughout the region , including King Abdullah of Jordan , President Sisi of Egypt , President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority , and Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia about making sure there real hope in the region for a better future about the need to work toward a greater integration for Israel while insisting that the aspirations of the Palestinian people will be part , will be part of that future as well .

              " 'Hamas leaders arrive in Moscow as the Kremlin attempts to showcase its clout . The delegation of the Palestinian military group was led by Moussa Abu Marzouk , a senior Hamas official , who met with Mikhail Bogdanov , the Russian deputy foreign minister , Hamas said in a statement . The two sides have discussed the release of foreign hostages from the Gaza Strip , the Russian foreign ministry said , according to RIA Novosti , a Russian state news agency . They also discussed the evacuation of Russians and other foreigners from the region . In its statement , Hamas praised Putin position on the conflict and the active efforts of Russian diplomacy . Since Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel on 7 , Russia has kept a conspicuous distance from the conflict . Days after , in his first comments about the war , Putin called it a clear example of the United States failed policy in the Middle East . In subsequent comments , Putin continued to accuse the United States of monopolizing the efforts to resolve the conflict and of neglecting the fundamental political issues that are preventing its resolution . He also called for an immediate cease fire and the resumption of talks in the framework of the two state solution to the conflict . But as the United States engaged in an intense flurry of talks with regional powers , presenting itself as the main power broker in the Middle East , Russia risked its assumed role as one of the major international powers with enough clout to be relevant in all major crises . Recently , Russia has been trying to catch up . Last week , Putin called all major leaders in the region , including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel . Bogdanov , the Russian deputy foreign minister , met with Hamas leadership in Qatar this week , according to Tass , the Russian state news agency . The meetings in Moscow on Thursday built on these efforts . Alexandra Appelberg , an editor with the Detaly news outlet in Israel , said that Russia is trying to demonstrate that the West plan to isolate it following the invasion of Ukraine has failed and that it plays an important role . According to Appelberg , Russia has practically no real levers that can allow Moscow to influence the situation , but that it might want to raise its prestige in the Arab world . Russia has historically capitalized on its ability to speak to all major parties in the ongoing conflict . One year after Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections , Putin met with Khaled Meshaal , then the group leader , in Moscow . Despite its own traumatic history with terrorism , Russia has never designated Hamas as a terrorist group . During a meeting with Russian religious leaders in the Kremlin on Wednesday , Putin offered his condolences to Israeli citizens and said that Russia knows firsthand what international terrorism is all about . But he also criticized Israel , saying that the fight against terrorism can not be conducted on the notorious principle of collective responsibility resulting in the deaths of the elderly , women , children , entire families . Bogdanov also met with his Iranian counterpart , Ali Bagheri Kani , on Thursday . In a statement , the Russian foreign ministry said that the two sides acknowledged the need to stop armed hostilities in the Gaza Strip and around it . Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting .',\n",
              " 'Israel prepares for invasion in Gaza ; UN fails to secure plans for aid Gaza : Israel kept up its strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza as it prepared for a ground invasion while more Palestinian civilians were killed and world powers at the United Nations failed to secure plans to deliver critical humanitarian aid . US President Joe Biden , in remarks looking beyond the war that began with an Oct 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian Hamas militants , said on Wednesday that the future should include Israeli and Palestinian states side by side . \" Israelis and Palestinians equally deserve to live side by side in safety , dignity and in peace , \" Biden said at a joint press conference in Washington with visiting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese . Biden said he believed one reason the Islamist Hamas group attacked southern Israel , killing people and taking more than 200 hostages of different nationalities , was to prevent normalising relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia . Israeli retaliatory strikes have killed over people , the health ministry in the Hamas run strip said on Wednesday . Reuters has been unable to independently verify casualty figures .

The United Arab Emirates also voted no , while 10 members voted in favour and two abstained . Russia made a rival proposal that advocated a wider ceasefire , but failed to win the minimum number of votes . Israel has resisted both , arguing that Hamas would only take advantage and create new threats to Gaza civilians .

I will not elaborate on when , how or how many . \" Israeli tanks and troops are massed on the border with Gaza awaiting orders . Israel has called up reservists . International pressure is growing to delay any invasion of Gaza , not least because of hostages . More than half the estimated 220 hostages held by Hamas have foreign passports from 25 different countries , the Israeli government said . Many were believed to have had dual Israeli nationality . The Wall Street Journal , citing US and Israeli officials , reported that Israel had agreed to delay invading Gaza for now so that the United States could rush missile defences to the region to protect US forces there , reflecting its concern the Gaza war may spread to other parts of the Middle East . US officials have so far persuaded Israel to hold off until US air defence systems can be placed in the region , as early as this week , the Journal said . Asked about the report , US officials told Reuters that Washington had raised its concerns with Israel that Iran and Iranian backed Islamist groups could escalate the conflict by attacking US troops in the Middle East . An Israeli incursion into Gaza could be a trigger for Iranian proxies , they said .',\n",

In the financial year 2023 , the company reported healthy growth in topline as well as bottomline owing to growth in its advertisement segment .

You see , the media industry plays a crucial role in an election year as political parties interact with voters using print media , television , radio , etc . This translates into revenue growth for the media industry . Sandesh , with its strong brand and established presence in Gujarat , could be one of the biggest beneficiaries . Currently , the company has zero debt on its books and it has maintained a healthy liquidity position . The company profits also show an increasing trend . This could continue in the medium term and stock could possibly catch up to its book value . 3 Gujarat State Fertilizers Third on this list is Gujarat State Fertilizers .

The company also has a long history of paying dividends . In , GSFC declared a one time special dividend of . This was significantly higher than the company average dividend yield of over the past 5 years . It also planning a massive capex for the next four years , around Rs 28 bn .

On the book value front , it trades at a P BV multiple of compared to its 5 year average of . While this may seem like an overvaluation , a fundamentally strong stock available at single digit PE multiple and below its book value might make the case . The valuations have shot up a bit in recent months after the company announced fundraising plans this year . In March 2023 , HUDCO board announced plans to raise Rs 180 bn as part of its fundraising exercise . The company is in the process of seeking fresh registration under the RBI as a housing finance company . It also rewards shareholders consistently by making large dividend payouts . HUDCO boasts of a high dividend yield of on its current market price .

This compares with its 5 year average PE of . On the book value front , it trades at a P BV multiple of compared to its 5 year average of . The undervaluation could be due to the fact that the Indian cotton textile industry has faced multiple challenges in the past one year . The high price volatility and the higher absolute raw materials prices have dented the margins . The relative price differences compared to the international markets have led to a massive competitive disadvantage for most Indian textile players . Apart from this , a demand slowdown due to geopolitical tensions and inflation in European and US economies has dented the profitability further . The company also posted a decline in revenue for the first quarter of while operating margins declined mainly on account of higher inventory cost and increase in employee expenses . Given its established market position and relatively strong balance sheet with zero debt , the company could possibly tide over this subdued phase . The company also pays consistent and higher dividend every year . Going forward , Ambika Cottom is well poised to benefit from the growth in the textile segment , which comes from rising disposable income in the country and the low cost advantage in terms of skilled manpower .

According to Lebanon Arabic language al Mayadeen television news network , Israeli drones launched missiles at the outskirts of Kfarchouba village , the heights of Halta village as well as the Bistara Farm near the occupied Shebaa Farm on Wednesday . This came after Hezbollah targeted the Branit barracks and another Israeli post facing Naqoura town in southern Lebanon . The Lebanese resistance fighters also successfully targeted an Israeli battle tank in the area of Avivim , killing and wounding a number of soldiers onboard the armored fighting vehicle . On Tuesday , an Israeli helicopter attack struck an empty position near the border town of Houla , after a missile fired from Lebanon hit an Israeli military position . The Israeli military said another missile attack hit a position in Manara , with no casualties . Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah addressed the Lebanese media outlets on Wednesday with a letter , asking them to call all recently fallen fighters of the group as the martyrs on the path to al Quds . Eleven Hezbollah fighters have been killed in the past 24 hours , as Israel and Hezbollah exchanged fire along the border . Hezbollah has warned that it will join the Palestinian resistance group Hamas and its allies in the fight against Israel if the regime escalates its aggression on Gaza and in case foreign military forces intervene to help the Israeli regime in the battle . Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stated on Tuesday that the Lebanese movement is at the core of the regional resistance campaign to defend the Gaza Strip against the ongoing Israeli aggression . Sheikh Qassem said in a post published on social media that Hezbollah has its finger on the trigger to whatever extent it deems necessary to defend Gaza and to face off the occupiers of Palestine . He said the United States and Europe should be held accountable for the atrocities committed by the Zionist regime of Israel against children and women in Gaza .',\n",

              " 'UN Security Council fails again to address Israel Hamas war , rejecting US and Russian resolutions The UN Security Council failed again Wednesday to address the Israeli Hamas war in Gaza , rejecting rival United States and Russian resolutions . The council is the most powerful body , charged with maintaining international peace and security , but its divisions have left it impotent and scrambling to try to find a resolution with acceptable language . The resolution drafted by the United States , Israel closest ally , would have reaffirmed Israel right to self defence , urged respect for international laws especially protection of civilians and called for humanitarian pauses to deliver desperately needed aid to Gaza . In Wednesday vote in the 15 member council , 10 countries voted in favour , Russia , China and the United Arab Emirates voted against , and Brazil and Mozambique abstained . The resolution was not adopted because permanent council members Russia and China cast vetoes . The Russian resolution , which was then put to a vote , would have called for an immediate humanitarian cease fire and unequivocally condemned Hamas October 7 attacks in Israel and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian objects in Gaza . In that vote , four countries voted in favour Russia , China , United Arab Emirates and Gabon . The United States and the United Kingdom voted against it , and nine countries abstained . The resolution was adopted because it failed to get the minimum nine yes votes . The failure of the two resolutions followed the council rejections last week of a Russian resolution that did mention Hamas and also failed to get nine yes votes and a widely supported Brazilian resolution vetoed by the United States that would have condemned the Hamas attacks and all violence against civilians and called for humanitarian pauses . After the votes , Malta Ambassador Vanessa Frazier , speaking on behalf of the 10 elected members of the council serving two year terms , announced they will be working on a new proposal in the coming days . As elected members of this council , we also represent the rest of the international community and we have a duty and an obligation to act , she told the council . There is no time to waste . Before the vote , Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield told the council that last week she had said diplomacy needed to play out before it approved a resolution . She pointed to action by Secretary General Antonio Guterres , President Joe Biden , and regional leaders that led to the opening of the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza to the delivery of some desperately needed humanitarian aid , though much , much more help is needed as well as the release of four of the more than 200 hostages taken from Israel . Thomas Greenfield called this moment a test for the international community and for the council . She accused Russia of introducing a resolution at the last minute in bad faith with no consultations and urged members to vote for the strong and balanced text . Russia Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia countered that an immediate humanitarian cease fire is needed to de escalate the conflict and reduce the bloodshed and shocking Palestinian casualties . He called the draft politicised and claimed the United States does want the Security Council to have any influence on a possible Israeli ground offensive that would risk provoking an even larger scale conflict in the region and possibly even beyond . After the vote , China Ambassador Zhang Jun said the draft contained many elements that went beyond humanitarian needs and were deeply divisive . He called it evasive on the most urgent issue of ending the fighting and said it failed to reflect the world strong calls for a cease fire . United Arab Emirates Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh , the Arab representative on the council who voted against the resolution and for the Russian draft , said the and humanitarian organisations have made clear that what is essential is a humanitarian cease fire , the release of all hostages , and sustained humanitarian access to Gaza . At a council meeting on the war Tuesday that heard nearly 90 speakers , there were dozens of statements imploring this council to assign the same value to Palestinian life as it does to Israeli life , Nusseibeh said . We can not allow any equivocation on this point . Israel Ambassador Gilad Erdan thanked the and other nations that supported its resolution for condemning savage genocidal terrorists while standing up for the values of freedom and security . Those who voted against the resolution showed the world the Security Council is incapable of condemning terrorists and can not confirm the right to self defence of the victim of these heinous crimes . Riyad Mansour , the Palestinian ambassador , told the Associated Press after the vote It disgusting the Security Council is not shouldering its responsibility to stop the war . \" You do not start by killing the people and then say that I want to deal with the situation , he said . We need to save lives . That is the most urgent priority . With the Security Council still paralysed , the Palestinians are turning to the 193 member General Assembly where there are no vetoes just as Ukraine did after Russia February 2022 invasion . The assembly emergency special session opens Thursday , with 106 speakers on the list , and Arab nations have circulated a draft resolution which Mansour said he expects to be put to a vote on Friday afternoon . The draft resolution calls for an immediate cease fire , demands that Israel rescind its order for Gazans to move from the north to the south , calls for maximum restraint , and demands that essential goods including food , water and medicine are provided in the Gaza Strip .',\n",

The United States and other countries are urging Israel to delay a full invasion ; Gaza is reeling from almost three weeks of Israeli bombing triggered by a mass killing spree in southern Israel by Iranian backed Hamas , which runs the besieged enclave . Other Iranian backed groups have since attacked Israel and forces elsewhere in the region ; Western leaders fear that a ground invasion with a high death toll among Palestinian civilians , who have already been killed in large numbers by Israeli air strikes , could spark a wider war . President Joe Biden held a call with Netanyahu , discussing ongoing efforts to locate and secure the release of Americans believed held hostage by militants in Gaza , the White House said overnight . Israel said there were 224 hostages . Hamas has threatened to kill some of those it holds , who include many foreign passport holders , but has freed four since Friday . Gaza began receiving a small amount of aid the following day . The White House said Biden and Netanyahu also discussed safe passage for other foreigners wishing to leave Gaza , a continuous flow of aid into the narrow coastal strip , and a pathway to permanent peace with the Palestinian people . The President reiterated that Israel has every right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism and to do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law , the statement said . The comments reflect a balancing act over support for Israel actions after Biden was criticised for casting doubt on Palestinian casualty figures . Netanyahu , who has suggested repeatedly that a ground invasion is imminent , told citizens in an address on Wednesday evening : I will not elaborate on when , how or how many . Israeli army radio said the military had overnight staged its biggest incursion into northern Gaza in the current war against Hamas , which Israel has vowed to eliminate . The military later released video on X showing armoured vehicles crossing the highly fortified barrier from Israel and blowing up buildings in preparation for the next stages of combat . Tanks and infantry struck numerous terrorist cells , infrastructure and anti tank missile launch posts , it said . Palestinians in Gaza said Israeli air strikes had pounded the territory again overnight and people living in central Gaza , near the Bureij refugee camp and east of Qarara village , reported intensive tank shelling all night .',\n",

AMNESTY SAYS ISRAEL ORDER FOR CIVILIANS TO LEAVE NORTHERN GAZA MAY VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL LAW Cairo : Amnesty International said Wednesday that the Israeli army order for residents of northern Gaza to leave may violate international humanitarian law . The Israeli army has been dropping leaflets in Gaza asking Palestinians to flee the northern half of the besieged enclave or risk being identified as accomplices of Hamas . The falling leaflets come around a week after the army first called on around million residents in northern Gaza to leave their homes and head southwards , as it prepares for a ground invasion of the territory . The messages in these leaflets can not be considered an effective warning to civilians , and instead provide further evidence that Israel aims to forcibly displace civilians in northern Gaza , said Donatella Rovera , Amnesty senior crisis response adviser . Declaring a whole city or region a military target flies in the face of international humanitarian law , Rovera added . SPAIN LEADER PRAISES UN SECRETARY GENERAL ROLE Brussels : Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European Union , gave his full support to UN Secretary General António Guterres for his role in the Gaza conflict .

Dozens more were injured . The Associated Press could independently verify the death tolls cited by Hamas , which says it tallies figures from hospital directors . EXPLOSION ROCKS AREA NEAR DESTROYED GAZA BAKERY Deir al Balah : Residents picking through the remains of a bakery destroyed in the Moghrabi refugee camp in Deir al Balah were startled as another deadly explosion rocked the area Wednesday . Men ran through rubble strewn streets carrying people wounded in the blast that killed at least one , according to an Associated Press reporter at the scene . The initial Israeli airstrike on the bakery and neighboring houses killed at least 10 people , the media office of Gaza Hamas run government said . It was the only bakery in the area and had just received flour from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees , known as UNRWA , the government said . One resident , Asad al Bairoti , was describing the attack on the bakery by Israeli warplanes when he looked to the sky and then ducked as a projectile whistled overhead followed by two bangs .

              " 'Hurricane Leaves At Least 27 Dead in Mexico Acapulco Hurricane Otis killed at least 27 people as it lashed Mexico beach resort city of Acapulco as a scale topping category 5 storm , officials said Thursday , in what residents called a total disaster . The storm crashed into Acapulco with furious winds of 165 miles 270 kilometers per hour , largely cutting off communications and road links with the region . President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador arrived at the scene late Wednesday , after his convoy found roads blocked by landslides and other debris , forcing top officials to abandon their vehicles and walk the final miles . The closures meant some residents slogged for hours through mud and debris in an attempt to find food and shelter . Acapulco is a total disaster . It is not what it was before . The park was totally destroyed , the buildings , all the streets , said 24 year old Eric Hernandez , who made the decision to leave on foot . The shops had all been looted , people were fighting for things . So we decided to walk as there was anything left there , he said . Others said an overflowing river and collapsed bridges had cut off communities near Acapulco . A lot of people got stuck on the other side of the river in our village , which was overflowing a lot . People were left homeless , there no electricity , said Israel Perez , a 21 year old baker . Security Minister Rosa Icela Rodriguez told a news conference Thursday that 27 people were dead and four were missing . Aid convoy : A convoy carrying humanitarian aid set off to try to reach Acapulco home to about people by land since the airport was closed , authorities said . Otis rapidly strengthened to the most powerful category of the five step Saffir Simpson scale before hitting land overnight Tuesday Wednesday , taking authorities by surprise . Rarely , according to records , does a hurricane develop so quickly and with such force , Lopez Obrador said . People recounted a terrifying ordeal as Otis made landfall on the usually sun kissed resort town . The building shook as if there was an earthquake , Citlali Portillo , a tourist accommodation manager , told the television channel Televisa , adding that she had taken shelter in a bathtub . Videos posted on social media showed severely damaged hotels and other buildings , including many shattered windows . Tourists used beds and mattresses for protection in their hotel rooms , once windows were blown out . Toppled trees were seen in the debris strewn streets and a shopping mall appeared to have suffered major structural damage in Acapulco , located in the southern state of Guerrero . More than 500 emergency shelters were opened for residents . Hurricanes hit Mexico every year on both its Pacific and Atlantic coasts , usually between May and November , though few make landfall as a Category 5 . In October 1997 , Hurricane Pauline hit Mexico Pacific coast as a Category 4 storm , leaving more than 200 people dead , some of them in Acapulco . It was one of the deadliest hurricanes to batter Mexico . In October 2015 , Patricia became the most powerful hurricane ever recorded , pummeling Mexico Pacific coast with sustained winds of 200 miles per hour . But the storm caused only material damage and no deaths as it made landfall in a sparsely populated mountainous area . Just this week , Tropical Storm Norma left three people dead , including a child , after making landfall for a second time in the northwestern state of Sinaloa . Earlier this month , two people died when Category 4 Hurricane Lidia struck the western states of Jalisco and Nayarit . Scientists have warned that storms are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer with climate change .',\n",
              " 'US strikes 2 Syrian facilities after attacks on its troops by Iran backed groups US President Joe Biden ordered strikes on two facilities in Syria following attacks on US troops in the past week , the Pentagon said , warning the US will take additional measures if attacks by Iran proxies continue . US forces have been hit more than a dozen times in Iraq and Syria in the past week by what Washington suspects are Iran backed groups . Hamas , Islamic Jihad and Lebanon Hezbollah are all backed by Tehran . advertisement Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said at the United Nations on Thursday that if Israel offensive against Hamas did not stop , the United States will \" not be spared from this fire \" . The US military on Thursday carried out strikes against two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and groups it backs , the Pentagon said . CLICK HERE FOR LIVE UPDATES ON ISRAEL HAMAS WAR \" These precision self defence strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups that began on October 17 , \" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement . Biden has sent a rare message to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning Tehran against targeting US personnel in the Middle East , the White House said earlier on Thursday . Israel said on Friday military raids into Gaza were preparing \" the next stage of the operation \" , amid fears that a ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave could spark a wider Middle East conflict . Israel has bombarded the densely populated Gaza Strip following the October 7 Hamas attack on Israeli communities . Israel says Hamas killed some people including children , and took more than 200 hostages , some of them infants and older adults . The Hamas controlled Gaza health ministry said on Thursday that Palestinians had been killed in the retaliatory air strikes , including children . Reuters could not independently verify the toll . More than people were estimated to have been made homeless and were being sheltered by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees , UNRWA . Egypt Al Qahera News , citing sources , said on Friday that a missile had struck a medical facility in the Egyptian Red Sea resort town of Taba near the Israeli border , injuring six people . Al Qahera said the blast was related to fighting between Israel and Gaza Hamas militants . Israel military said it was aware of a security incident in the area . This week , Israel said a rocket claimed by Hamas hit an area outlying Eilat , the Israeli town across the border from Taba . advertisement A witness in Taba , which lies about 220 km 135 miles from Gaza , reported hearing an explosion and seeing heavy smoke and dust rising . Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the reports . UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY Palestinian militants clashed with Israeli troops in at least two areas of the Gaza Strip on Friday , Hamas affiliated media reported . Israeli military vehicles raided the central area of Al Bureij and troops were clashing with militants near the border there , the reports said . In the south , in a border area near the town of Rafah , Hamas militants were trading fire with Israeli troops , according to the reports . Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the reports . As the plight of Palestinian civilians grows more desperate , the issue of whether to have humanitarian pauses or ceasefire agreements in the Hamas run coastal enclave will come before the 193 member UN General Assembly on Friday in a draft resolution submitted by Arab states calling for a ceasefire . Unlike in the Security Council where resolutions on Gaza aid failed this week , no country holds a veto in the General Assembly . Resolutions are non binding , but carry political weight . In Brussels , the 27 leaders of the EU reached a compromise declaration after days of wrangling , expressing the \" gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza \" . advertisement They called for \" continued , rapid , safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs \" . While EU leaders have strongly condemned Hamas attack , they have struggled to stick to the same message beyond that , with some stressing Israel right to self defence and others emphasising concern about Palestinian civilians . Separately , Mamadou Sow , head of the International Committee of the Red Cross regional delegation , said from Jeddah : \" To say that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is catastrophic is an understatement . Everything that is needed to sustain life is missing or dwindling by the hour in Gaza . \" US SENDS MORE TROOPS TO REGION Governments in the West and the Middle East are concerned about a wider regional conflict developing if Israel continues its bombardment of Gaza or mounts a ground invasion in response to the surprise attack by Hamas . Israel and Lebanon based Hezbollah have already exchanged fire and Israel has targeted Syrian army infrastructure and airports . The United States has sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region over the last three weeks . On Thursday , the Pentagon said about 900 more troops have arrived in the Middle East or are heading there to bolster air defences for US personnel . For Israel part , Defence Minister Yoav Gallant , asked at a press conference about the possibility of a confrontation with Iran , said Israel has \" no interest in expanding the war . \" Edited By : chingkheinganbi mayengbam Published On : Oct 27 , 2023',\n",
              " 'Pentagon amps up posture in Middle East in response to escalations WASHINGTON , VATICAN CITY : The US warned against any escalation in the Middle East in the wake of Israel war with Hamas , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday , hours after the Pentagon moved to step up military readiness in the region . The US has seen a prospect of significant escalation of attacks on our troops in the region , Austin said , adding that the US military was preparing for the ability to respond . If any group or any country is looking to widen this conflict and take advantage of this very unfortunate situation that we see , our advice is : do , he told ABC News . We maintain the right to defend ourselves and we wo hesitate to take the appropriate action , he added . His comments came hours after the Pentagon said it was upping readiness in the region in response to recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces . Austin ordered the activation of air defense systems and notified additional forces that they may be deployed soon . Austin did not say how many US troops would be added to those already in the region . The Pentagon moves came after what Austin had earlier described in a statement as detailed discussions with President Joe Biden . These steps will bolster regional deterrence efforts , increase force protection for US forces in the region , and assist in the defense of Israel , Austin said . The steps continued the Biden administration response since Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip stormed Israel on 7 , taking more than 200 hostages and killing at least people . Israel has since vowed to destroy Hamas , and says around of the group fighters were killed in clashes before its army regained control of the area initially under attack . Austin said he had activated deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD battery and additional Patriot battalions throughout the region . He added : Finally , I have placed an additional number of forces on prepare to deploy orders as part of prudent contingency planning , to increase their readiness and ability to quickly respond as required . US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told NBC News actions by Iran and its proxies could spark an escalation and that the US hoped for more hostages to be released by Hamas . Tensions are rising along Israel northern border with Lebanon after the Israeli army traded fire with the Iran backed militant group Hezbollah amid fears of a new front opening as Israel battles Hamas . In south Lebanon on Saturday , Hezbollah said four of its fighters were killed . Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said one of its fighters was also killed . Armed factions close to Iran have threatened to attack US interests in Iraq over Washington support for Israel . Multiple Iraqi bases used by US led coalition troops have been targeted in several attacks in recent days . China calls for truce China believes force is not a way to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict and is once again calling for a ceasefire , its envoy for the Middle East pleaded in Egypt , the Foreign Ministry said on Sunday . Egypt on Saturday hosted a summit for peace where UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for swift action to end this godawful nightmare . Beijing envoy for the Middle East , Zhai Jun , met Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit on the sidelines of the summit . The Chinese diplomat called for an immediate ceasefire and an end to the fighting as quickly as possible , his ministry said in a statement . China believes that force is not a way to resolve the problem and that responding to violence with violence will only lead to a vicious circle of revenge , Zhai said according to the statement , which mentioned neither Israel nor Hamas . China has so far maintained good relations with Israel , but it has supported the Palestinian cause for decades and traditionally backs a two state solution . China said on Thursday it was deeply disappointed by the US decision to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for a humanitarian pause in the Israel Hamas conflict . Washington justified its veto because the text did not mention Israel right to defend itself . Chinese President Xi Jinping said it was crucial to prevent the conflict from expanding or even losing control and causing a serious humanitarian crisis , as he met with Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli in Beijing on Thursday .',\n",

Derrick Van Orden , Republican of western Wisconsin By Peter Cameron , THE BADGER PROJECT After more than three weeks , the United States of America has a Speaker of the House of Representatives . Multiple GOP candidates failed to receive a majority of House votes in the past few weeks , but a unanimous vote from congressional Republicans Wednesday installed Mike Johnson of Louisiana as Speaker . The powerful position is second in line to the presidency , behind the vice president . Johnson is a socially conservative attorney who played a leading role in congressional efforts to overturn the 2020 election . The Republicans slim 9 seat majority in the 435 member House made nearly all their votes essential , as Democrats repeatedly backed their minority leader Hakeem Jeffries , a customary move from the party in the minority . Three Democrats did not vote . Derrick Van Orden , a Republican from Prairie du Chien in western Wisconsin , was the only Republican not to vote . He has been in Israel for several days on a fact finding trip . It apparently a self assigned mission . Van Orden press secretary did not respond to emailed questions . When he departed for the Middle East last week , Van Orden released a statement explaining why he was leaving during an unprecedented time for the , one in which his vote might have been needed by his party . Currently , as I write this piece , there is no path for a new Speaker , and Congress remains rudderless and in disarray , he wrote in a statement released Friday titled My commitment to Israel in the midst of congressional chaos . There is no sense of urgency to elect a Speaker despite the many challenges we face at home , including an open southern border and skyrocketing gas and grocery prices . It was a great honor to to participate in a traditional Jewish ceremony of making bread in a time of sorrow or triumph . We made bread and prayed for all of the murdered and those that have been taken hostage . The bread was given to soldiers the next morning . Derrick Van Orden October 25 , 2023 Van Orden wrote that he had several reasons for taking the trip . As a retired Navy SEAL and combat medic , I am uniquely qualified to objectively ascertain the ground truth and bring that information back to Congress where I can hopefully increase the sense of urgency for my colleagues of both parties to put aside their petty personal and significant political differences and act in the best interest of America and our beleaguered allies , he continued . Yesterday , presumably from Israel , Van Orden tweeted Mike Johnson is an outstanding man and will make a fantastic Speaker . The eight congressional Republicans from Wisconsin voted yea for the Speaker candidate in all previous votes , including to retain former Speaker Kevin McCarthy , and twice for Jim Jordan , a graduate of the University of Wisconsin , to take the top spot . The remaining seven Wisconsin Republicans all voted for Johnson . The two Wisconsin Democrats Reps .

              " 'Report : Israel Sends Armored Force Into West Bank More than 100 armored vehicles from Israel Defense Forces reportedly entered the city of Jenin in the West Bank late Thursday into Friday morning local time in an apparent large scale effort to arrest terrorists from Iran backed Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad . Open source intelligence monitor OSINTdefender posted on X video of the ground force that included Caterpillar armored bulldozers . The post said the IDF had come under heavy fire since entering the city . There were no reports of casualties . Earlier in the day , the IDF and Shin Bet , Israel version of the FBI , reported more than 60 people were arrested in another raid that took place in the West Bank . According to News , 46 were believed to be Hamas operatives . According to a joint statement from the IDF and Shin Bet , weapons , including two rifles , and incendiary materials were confiscated during the raid in the city of Tubasm , as well as in the village of Ein a Shariat , in the Binyamin division . Overall , about people have been arrested across the West Bank since Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on 7 , including 660 associated with Hamas , the statement said . On Wednesday , the IDF reported the arrests of 68 people , 58 of whom have suspected ties to Hamas . Since Hamas terrorist attack that killed more than Israelis , the IDF has retaliated through an unprecedented aerial bombardment on the Gaza Strip . On Thursday , the IDF said airstrikes killed five senior Hamas commanders including Shadi Barud , the deputy head of Hamas intelligence force , The Times of Israel reported .

              " 'With House speaker installed , US Congress returns to spending battles The morning after House of Representatives Republicans united around new Speaker Mike Johnson , lawmakers on Thursday returned their attention to spending bills urgently needed to avert a government shutdown and respond to crises overseas . Congress has just over three weeks until a stopgap measure to keep federal agencies funded runs out on 17 , and Democratic President Joe Biden is also pushing for 106 billion in new spending to aid Israel and Ukraine , and beef up enforcement at the border . Meanwhile , House Republicans are pushing for a full plate of 12 separate funding bills to keep agencies running until 30 , 2024 , the end of the fiscal year . This rare feat requires close negotiation between the narrowly Republican controlled House and the Senate , which has a two vote Democratic majority . \" We are going to deliver an aggressive schedule in the days and weeks ahead , \" Johnson told reporters on Wednesday , shortly after he was sworn in as speaker . Fights over money have occupied most of Congress time for the past year . Partisan disputes brought the federal government to the brink of defaulting on its trillion in debt in May , an event that would have shaken the world financial system . Less than a month ago , intra party fighting among Republicans brought the federal government within hours of a partial shutdown , with hardline Republicans rejecting a trillion discretionary spending limit Biden and Johnson predecessor Kevin McCarthy had agreed on , instead calling for an additional 120 billion in cuts . Since then , high interest rates have pushed up the government cost of borrowing and for the federal Social Security and Medicare programs , driving Washington to a trillion deficit for the fiscal year ended 30 . Even the simplest steps like arriving at the duration of a short term funding measure known as a \" continuing resolution \" that lawmakers agree will be needed to avoid a shutdown next month were complicated by this month vacant speakership . \" It something we have to negotiate with the House and that difficult at the moment , \" Republican Senator John Kennedy , a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee , noted the day before Johnson election . SENATE PROGRESS The Senate , following long delays imposed by a few Republicans , is moving ahead with three of its 12 bipartisan funding bills . By next week it hopes to pass appropriations for farm programs , transportation and housing and veterans . Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wants to then pivot to considering the aid money for Israel , Ukraine and Taiwan and the stop gap funding . But the fiscal warfare between the Senate and conservative House Republicans that has raged since January is unlikely to end soon . \" Bipartisanship will be essential for keeping the government open in less than a month and bipartisanship will be essential for passing the president national security request , \" Schumer said in a Senate speech . Significant changes by Congress to Biden request for aid to Ukraine and more money for border security were anticipated . Republican Representative Tom Cole , a powerful lawmaker who heads the gatekeeping committee for House legislation , said that \" wedge \" issues partisan priorities would slow the emergency spending package the White House is seeking . \" We need to be able to respond quickly and decisively in the kind of times we live in right now , \" Cole said . Asked what his advice to Johnson would be , he added , \" do overplay your hand . \" Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Nanette Diaz Barragan said in an interview that she does not believe money targeted to cities is enough to provide shelter and other services for immigrants being transported from the southwest border with Mexico to northern destinations . Republicans attack Biden border security spending , saying it falls far short in shutting down illegal border crossings and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl . And far right conservatives could demand deep cuts in the stop gap bill , instead of simply extending current spending levels . Senate appropriators from the two parties had varying expectations . Democratic Senator Joe Manchin stressed the need for beefed up border security . \" It the only way you can go home and explain to people \" also voting for aid to Ukraine and Israel , said Manchin , who is mulling whether to run for re election in West Virginia , which is now heavily Republican . Senator Kennedy , who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee with Manchin , was upbeat , saying quick progress on more of those 12 bills was possible in coming weeks .

              " 'Devil Advocates Play the Blame Game Israel May Erase Hamas But Iran Has Already Won is the title of an article posted on the Bloomberg website on October 11 . Jessica Karl , Bloomberg opinion columnist , quotes Marc Champion as saying : The Hamas attack is precisely the kind of ostentatiously disruptive operation Iran has wanted to see for years , and offers a welcome distraction from its many internal problems . Connecting the Hamas operation to Iran is a plot to somehow cover up Tel Aviv humiliation . Yet Iran has always stood next to the oppressed Palestinian nation . Also , the author point about Iran effort to divert attention from internal problems is the most superficial analysis . Of course , it can not be denied that Tel Aviv weaknesses have a positive effect not only on Iran internal security , but on the entire region as Israel has a dark history of carrying out assassinations , supporting terrorists , and trying to destabilize countries . Iran has left behind the 2022 riots and is moving forward despite the sanctions imposed on the country . However , the Israeli regime is grappling with demonstrations and instability , so connecting the Hamas operation to Iran with this claim that Iran seeks distraction from its internal problems is baseless . Iran enjoys the internal tranquility which has paved the way for the country development in various aspects . Iran has been supporting the oppressed Palestinian people since 1979 . Connecting the recent conflicts between the occupying regime and the Palestinian resistance forces to geopolitical competition between Iran and the Israeli regime ignores the sufferings of the Palestinian people since 1948 . Elsewhere , the author quotes James Stavridis : The hefty American fleet sends a signal to Iran , Hamas principal backer , that any attempt to take advantage of this dangerous moment in Israeli history would face the might of the US military . In fact , the presence of the hefty fleet was a signal for Israel to relentlessly break new records in its war crimes in the Gaza Strip . The bombing of Al Ahli hospital , residential areas , and the killing of women and children would not have been possible without the support of the United States and of course the constant support of the Western media outlets . Bloomberg writer is among those who run the propaganda campaign with baseless and undocumented claims such as the beheading of children and the use of human shields by Hamas , which was claimed at the beginning of her analysis . These baseless claims have paved the way for Zionists repeated crimes and killing spree . Regarding military threats against Iran , Karl quotes Marc Champion : \" Invading a nation of 88 million that cut through by mountains and more than times the size of Ukraine is an option . \" It is clear that invading Iran is no longer an option , and in case of an attack , Western writers will not need to refer to the map to know the points of conflict , because everyone will feel the effects of this attack in their surroundings . Karl final proposal to prevent Iran from supporting Hamas is similar to the analyses written on the restriction of oil sales . She writes : Saudi Arabia has cut its oil production to try and boost prices , while Iran has increased its production by as much as barrels per day , but Javier Blas says it might not be that way for much longer . Given that Iran is Hamas biggest backer , Washington wo be able to maintain its hands off approach to the country crude production indefinitely . Javier Blas also says , \" Saudi Arabia significantly reduced its oil production last year , while Iran was able to increase its production during the same period despite sanctions . \" Considering that Iran is the biggest supporter of Hamas , Washington can not indefinitely maintain its passive approach toward the country crude oil production . So far , the has done its best to deprive Iran of oil revenues , while Karl proposal for further restrictions seems opaque . Probably , she refers to the pirates manner of stealing and selling Iran oil , which completely suits Washington . And of course , Iran will not leave the action unanswered .',\n",

Domestic inflow in India has been very resilient , strong and thereby , actually helped the overall indices to not give away those kind of gains and to also decrease the overall volatility , \" Vaibhav Sanghavi , chief executive officer at ASK Hedge Solutions told to BQ Prime .

              " 'Israel Hamas War Highlights Around 50 hostages killed in Gaza due to Israeli strikes , says Hamas Turkey urges WHO to do more for Gazans hit by war Turkey health minister said on Thursday that he had urged the World Health Organization WHO to guarantee the provision of medical services to Gazans hit by the Israel Hamas war , and that its efforts so far were insufficient . The WHO vigorously defended its actions , saying it had been striving to get supplies into Gaza since the start of the emergency . NATO member Turkey has so far sent nine cargo planes of aid to Egypt for the Gaza Strip , and offered to set up a field hospital in Egypt to help treat the wounded and fly some to Turkey if necessary . It has condemned Israel attacks on the Palestinian enclave and called for an immediate ceasefire to allow more humanitarian aid in . Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said he had reminded WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a letter sent on Wednesday of the WHO professional responsibility to help civilians in need and told him that its efforts should be \" much greater than what you have done so far \" . \" WHO , with its responsibility of leadership and by taking necessary initiatives urgently , must ensure the safety of healthcare provisions in Gaza , \" Koca wrote in the letter , which he posted on X , formerly Twitter .

              " 'Palestinians Plead Stop The Bombs at UN Meeting but Israel Insists Hamas Must Be Obliterated Stop the bombs and save lives ! the Palestinian ambassador pleaded at an emotional UN meeting on Thursday on the war in Gaza . But Israel envoy was adamant , declaring again , We will not rest until Hamas is obliterated . The war sparked by Gaza Hamas rulers surprise attacks on Israel on October 7 played out in the vast hall of the 193 nation General Assembly , where Arab nations expected to adopt a resolution on Friday calling for an immediate cease fire in Gaza after the Security Council four failed attempts to agree on any action . At the assembly resumed emergency special session on Israeli actions in the Palestinian territories on Thursday , speaker after speaker backed the Arab resolution cease fire call except for Israel UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan , who told the 193 member world body . A cease fire means giving Hamas time to rearm itself , so they can massacre us again . After quoting several Hamas statements vowing to destroy Israel and the Jews , he said , Any call for a cease fire is not an attempt at peace . It is an attempt to tie Israel hands , preventing us from eliminating a huge threat to our citizens . But the calls for a cease fire , the protection of Palestinian civilians facing constant Israeli bombardments in Gaza and the delivery of desperately needed food , water , medicine and fuel were often passionate and intense from nearly a dozen countries that spoke Thursday . While the Hamas attacks killed some Israelis , more than Palestinians have been killed in Israel retaliatory airstrikes , according to the Gaza Health Ministry . On another key issue the more than 220 hostages taken from Israel Iran foreign minister said Hamas is ready to release civilian prisoners , and he said the international community must take responsibility for releasing Palestinian prisoners held in Israel . Iran stands ready to play its part in this very important humanitarian endeavour , along with Qatar and Turkiye , Hossein Amirabdollahian told the assembly . Iran is a key backer of Hamas and Qatar has already played a key role in the release of four Israeli civilians . Israel Erdan said the country action has nothing to do with the Arab Israeli conflict or the Palestinian question . This is not a war with the Palestinians . Israel is at war with the genocidal Jihadist Hamas terror organisation , he said . But Riyad Mansour , the Palestinian UN ambassador , said 70 per cent of those killed in Gaza were children and women . Is this the war some of you are defending ? Can this war be defended ? These are crimes . This is barbarism , he said . If you do not stop it for all those who were killed , stop it for all those whose lives we can still save , he said . The anguish over the deaths on both sides was palpable . Mansour voice cracked when he spoke of a Palestinian girl killed before the birthday her father had planned and a man hugging the body of his dead mother and saying : Come back , and I will take you wherever you want . Erdan voice rose when he told the assembly of Hamas fighters firing blindly at hundreds of young people at a concert in southern Israel , parading naked girls that they had raped , and crushing the skulls of babies . He showed a brief video of a badly injured agricultural worker from Thailand being decapitated with a blunt gardening tool . Jordan Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi , speaking on behalf of the 22 nation Arab Group , spoke emotionally of children dying under the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli precision bombs , and some still alive and trapped with no equipment to pull them out . The parents can still hear them . They talk to them helplessly , knowing that they are running out of air and are slowly dying , he said . In a sharp rebuke to the Israeli ambassador , he told the assembly , I do have videos to show you . We respect the dead too much . We respect the pain of their families too much to show videos . Safadi also criticised Erdan for not saying a word about Palestinian lives shattered in this war . Do let them tell you this is a war between Muslims and Jews , he said . We value life , Muslim life , Christian life , Jewish life . He was interrupted with applause when he then said , We care about all lives . Do let them tell you otherwise . The Jordanian minister also told Israel that it can not remain above international law requiring protection of civilians , hospitals , schools , homes and other infrastructure . The right to self defence is not a license to kill with impunity , he stressed . Safadi also criticised the United States and its allies without naming them . Many among us believe that they are helping Israel by supporting its war , he said . They are not . Instead of sending weapons to Israel , send delegations to open an immediate and viable path to peace . This is how they can help Israel . Iran Amirabdollahian accused the United States of directly participating in the war and what he called a genocide against the Palestinians . The genocide in Gaza must stop immediately , he said . He warned against the uncontrollable consequences of the unlimited financial , arms and operational support by the White House to the Tel Aviv regime which has added to the severe bombardments and killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza . The emergency General Assembly meeting resumes Friday morning , with about 100 speakers remaining . The resolution that Mansour said will be put to a vote on Friday afternoon calls for an immediate cease fire and demands that all parties respect international law and protect civilians . It says that essential goods including food , water and medicine should be provided in the Gaza Strip . It also calls for Israel to rescind its order for Gazans to move from the north to the south , for maximum restraint and for the release of all civilians . Unlike the Security Council , there are no vetoes in the General Assembly and its resolutions are not legally binding . But they do reflect world opinion and the size of the vote in favour will be closely watched . The Palestinians have wide support , but Israel Erdan called the resolution a disgrace for not even mentioning Hamas and urged countries to oppose it .',\n",

Business messaging continues to grow across our services and will be the next major pillar of our business . There are over 600 million conversations between people and businesses every day on our platforms . To give you a sense of what this could look like when it scaled globally , every week now , more than 60 of people on WhatsApp in India message a business app account . Our revenue from click to message ads in India has doubled year over year . This is going to be a really big opportunity for new business AIs , \" Mark Zuckerberg , chief executive of Meta , said in his remarks to investors after the social media giant reported its fastest revenue growth rate in the past two years . Click to message ads involve advertisements that run on social media platforms , such as Meta Facebook and Instagram , and direct users to a conversation interface on one of Meta Messenger , Instagram , and WhatsApp chat platforms for businesses and customers to connect with each other . The company earns a commission from businesses using the chat service and selling products through these platforms . In India , WhatsApp is a key monetization avenue for Meta . As per industry estimates , WhatsApp could have over 480 million monthly active users in India its highest base worldwide . To push this further , on 19 September , Meta launched multiple new features to double down on WhatsApp as a business offering in India launching customized conversation tonalities for businesses called Flow , as well as in chat payments via Unified Payments Interface UPI , and verified badges for authentic businesses . Multiple industries , including established businesses and small ventures , are steadily expanding adoption of click to message ad formats for user base conversion . A senior marketing industry executive who offers consultation services to multiple top hospitality groups in India said this is the obvious way for the brands . Companies everywhere are betting on more users getting familiar with text interfaces rather than traditional advertising . Top hotels are using chat interfaces as a way to promote special offers this festive season , and smaller brands with a younger outlook have preferred the medium ever since it was available in India . This could be alarming for Google traditional ad business , \" the executive said , requesting anonymity . Google , too , has taken note . On 19 October , it launched Business Messages within the Shopping tab on its core search platform . While the latter seeks to grab a share of WhatsApp business pie , it remains to be seen how adoption for it grows . WhatsApp is the default texting app for smartphone users in India , which is what makes it ubiquitous and preferable for businesses . The same is true for Google Search , and it is not a natural instinct for users to find and chat with businesses from within their browsers , \" he added . Zuckerberg statement comes amid contrasting situations for Meta while Zuckerberg and chief financial officer Susan Li expressed caution and uncertainty about Meta core ad revenue business in 2024 , Meta India business has continued to grow steadily . The company India earnings for , filed with the Registrar of Companies RoC on 23 October , showed a 13 increase in gross advertisement revenue to crore from the previous year , while net profit expanded 19 to 352 crore . Meta saw mixed fortunes post earnings . While it beat analyst estimates to post 21 constant currency quarterly operating revenue growth to billion , its share was down over previous closing at the time of writing driven by uncertainty in the upcoming quarters . We are seeing more volatility at the start of the December quarter . That in part why we widened our guidance range to capture that uncertainty .

Advertisement Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian sent a letter Sunday to Paul Richard Gallagher his Vatican counterpart calling on the Roman Catholic Church to \" defend the rights and lives of the nation of Palestine . \" Palestine , a nation that has observer status with the United Nations , is recognized by the majority of countries around the world . It includes the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank . \" The terrible crime of the Zionist regime attack on the Al Ahli Arab Hospital and the bombing of the historic Greek Orthodox Church of Porphyrius in Gaza , where children and women were sheltering , shows another aspect of the brutal and malicious nature of the Zionist regime , \" Amir Abdollahian said . Amir Abdollahian referenced an Israeli air strike that killed more than a dozen Christian Palestinians sheltered in the church . \" This shows that the Israeli regime implements systematic apartheid not only against Muslims but also against the followers of all Abrahamic religions , including Christians , \" he said . Advertisement Meanwhile , President Joe Biden called Pope Francis on Sunday , according to a readout provided by the White House . \" Today , President Joseph Biden spoke with His Holiness Pope Francis to discuss the latest developments in Israel and Gaza .

They also discussed the need to prevent escalation in the region and to work toward a durable peace in the Middle East . \" The news came as the Church of England joined Catholic and Orthodox churches around the globe in calling for a ceasefire after the air strike on Gaza .

The statement was largely critical of Israel . \" Let hope that reason returns to those who make decisions , \" said Pierbattista Pizzaballa the head of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem seated in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in comments to Italian Catholic television . \" War and bombs have never solved problems ; on the contrary , they always create new ones . \"',\n",

What I asking of our dear neighbours in the area is not to fall prey to fake news and falsehoods and lies that are doctored by a terrorist organization . Whatever the cause , there have been more than 50 strikes against health care facilities in Gaza since the latest surge of violence , according to the World Health Organization WHO . Richard Peeperkorn , WHO representative for the West Bank and Gaza , says 15 health workers have been killed and 27 injured . Humanitarian workers and doctors agree that such attacks are particularly abhorrent because , even during a war , health care facilities and workers trying to save civilian lives are supposed to be left untouched under international law , including the fourth Geneva Convention . WATCH Determining the cause : What experts would look for to determine cause of Gaza hospital blast Duration Featured Video Andres Gannon , an assistant professor of political science at Vanderbilt University , discusses what evidence experts would use to determine what caused a deadly explosion at a Gaza City hospital . He warns that the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas would make it more difficult to identify the cause . \" The fact that this has been repeatedly flouted , this rule of law , is creating an untenable situation , \" said Joseph Bellibeau , executive director at Doctors Without Borders Canada . \" What is happening is unconscionable . \" On Tuesday , the hospital was packed with people who been forced from their homes as Israel continued its assault , in retaliation for Hamas incursion on 7 . In that attack , Hamas militants killed hundreds of civilians and took more than 150 people hostage including several Canadians . It unclear exactly how many people were killed in the hospital blast Tuesday . The Hamas controlled Health Ministry in Gaza said 471 people died while another 314 were wounded , a tally that would make it one of the deadliest civilian events in the decades long conflict between Israel and Hamas . WATCH Hundreds sheltering in hospitals : Gaza situation unconscionable , Doctors Without Borders official says after hospital hit by airstrike Duration Featured Video Doctors Without Borders Canada executive director Joseph Belliveau told Power Politics on Tuesday from Geneva that hundreds of people are sheltering in hospitals in Gaza because they felt so vulnerable being out in the street that they thought hospitals would be relatively safer places and they should be . Atrocious conditions Supported by charities , Al Ahli Arab Hospital is described on its website as \" a haven of peace in the middle of one of the world most troubled places . \" The 80 bed facility in Gaza City Zeitoun neighbourhood runs free programs to detect breast cancer , support elderly women and offers help to surrounding communities at no charge . Now , Belliveau says , physicians have had to move surgical procedures to other hospitals in the city . He said they are doing operations on floors or in hallways under \" atrocious \" hygienic conditions without any anesthetic . He says doctors fear people wounded in the blast will die because the territory is running out of medicine , water and other critical supplies amid the blockade Israel launched last week . LISTEN Nowhere to go in Gaza : As It Happens Reverend desperately sad and frustrated by Gaza hospital explosion A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu office on Wednesday said Israel would start allowing some food , water and medicine from Egypt into Gaza \" as long as these supplies do not reach Hamas . \" The statement did not specify how much aid would be sent or when it might arrive . Mike Ryan , executive director of WHO health emergencies program , said it was \" inhumane \" to leave Gaza health workers with the dilemma of caring for their patients or fleeing to save their own lives . He said doctors and nurses were choosing their patients over themselves . \" It is absolutely clear to all sides of this conflict where the health facilities are , \" Ryan said . \" It is absolutely clear health care is not a target That is enshrined in international humanitarian law . And we seeing this breached again and again and again over the last week . And it has to stop . It must stop . \"',\n",

              " 'Gaza crisis : Deadlock deepens as Security Council rejects competing resolutions by US , Russia New Delhi : Yesterday , the United Nations Security Council found itself mired in a deepening deadlock as it rejected competing resolutions put forth by the United States and Russia in response to the ongoing crisis in Gaza and Israel . China and Russia wielded their veto power to block a draft resolution sponsored by the United States , while a second Russian backed resolution failed to secure the required number of votes for adoption . The draft resolution failed to pass , primarily due to negative votes from permanent Security Council members China and Russia . The vote tally stood at ten in favour , with three against China , Russia , and the UAE and two abstentions Brazil and Mozambique . The second draft resolution , spearheaded by Russia , also faced rejection as it could garner enough votes in favour . It received support from four Council members China , Gabon , Russia , and the UAE , faced opposition from the UK and the US , and saw nine abstentions Albania , Brazil , Ecuador , France , Ghana , Japan , Malta , Mozambique , and Switzerland . For a resolution to be adopted , it requires the backing of at least nine Council members . Both of these competing resolutions contained similar language , calling for a \" humanitarian ceasefire \" or \" humanitarian pause \" to enable the safe delivery of aid to the desperate civilians in Gaza . Both drafts also condemned the terror attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians that occurred on October 7 and urged immediate action to address the worsening humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip . However , notable differences existed in the texts . The proposal explicitly mentioned states inherent right to self defense , while the Russian led resolution called for the immediate cancellation of the Israeli forces evacuation order for civilians heading into southern Gaza . It important to note that draft resolutions do not represent the official position of the 15 member Security Council until they are adopted .',\n",

              " 'Who is Mike Johnson , the new US Republican House speaker ? Mike Johnson was elected as House speaker after three other candidates were unable to secure enough votes . Mike Johnson , a relatively lesser known Republican from Louisiana , has taken the gavel as the new speaker of the US House of Representatives , ending three weeks of political chaos . The people House is back in business , Johnson declared after taking the gavel . Johnson , 51 , is a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump , who backed him for the post . The new speaker has his work cut out amid infighting in his Republican party . Here is what to know about Johnson and his recent election . Why the speaker race was marred by chaos ? The speaker chair of the House became vacant after Kevin McCarthy was removed on October 3 by the hard right section of the Republican Party after McCarthy approved a bipartisan temporary funding bill to avoid government shutdown . The stakes were high for US lawmakers , who were unable to function in the wake of urgent issues such as the looming threat of the US government shut down as well as the Israel Palestine conflict and the war in Ukraine . A cohort of Republican contenders for the new House speaker role struggled with party infighting . Hours before Johnson nomination , Republican whip Tom Emmer dropped his bid after Trump urged Republicans to oppose him . Besides Emmer , House Majority Leader Steve Scalise withdrew while Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan was pushed out from the race after failed attempts at securing the votes . Despite private balloting , Johnson won 220 votes against Democrat Hakeem Jefferies , who won 209 . Democrats said they are open to a compromise candidate who would allow the chamber to function . Republicans hold the majority in the House with 221 members as opposed to 212 Democrats . Who is Mike Johnson ? Johnson was elected to the Louisiana statehouse in 2015 and ran for Congress successfully in 2016 . He now represents Louisiana fourth congressional district . He is the first Louisianan to become speaker and the first southerner to serve as speaker since Republican Newt Gingrich of Georgia in the . He describes himself as a Christian , a husband , a father , a life long conservative , constitutional law attorney and a small business owner . He has opposed abortion rights and same sex marriage .

He successfully defended Louisiana same sex marriage ban in 2004 . Johnson has drawn on his religious beliefs throughout his work . He is also the former chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee . But it remains to be seen how well Johnson will fare at uniting his fractured party as the House immediately plunges into debates over government spending or in gaining trust from Democrats who are deeply suspicious of his socially conservative record and support for Trump . The House will have to pass a spending bill by mid November when the current stopgap measures expire . Is he a Trump ally ? Johnson defended and played a role in Trump attempts to overturn the 2020 election results following Joe Biden victory . I have just called President Trump to say this : \" Stay strong and keep fighting , sir ! The nation is depending upon your resolve . We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans trust in the fairness of our election system . \" Mike Johnson November 7 , 2020 He has earned the nickname MAGA Mike among his hard right colleagues , a reference to Trump campaign slogan Make America Great Again , which continues to be associated with Trumpian ideals . Trump also backed Johnson in the race saying : I think he gon na be a fantastic speaker . Where does he stand on issues ? Israel Palestine conflict : Johnson supports Israel and his first act as speaker was calling up a resolution reaffirming US commitment to Israel . address to the nation tonight only confirms the urgent need for the to act in support of our great ally , Israel , as they fight against Hamas terrorists . We must elect a Speaker so the House can take all necessary action to end Hamas forever . Mike Johnson October 20 , 2023 Ukraine : He is against sending Ukraine aid to defend itself against Russia , receiving an F from advocacy group Republicans for Ukraine .

              " 'Indian economy chugs along amid global headwinds , market rout India is often called a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy global economy . But no one is immune to spillovers from international developments . It has been a difficult few days for Indian financial markets . The Nifty closed below on October 26 and is down nearly 4 percent over last week . And if this trend holds , foreign portfolio investors will be net sellers again from the local equity markets in October , with September billion worth of net outflows already almost eclipsed by outflows of billion so far this month . But the rout in the domestic stock markets will not be a surprise to the Indian government , with the Finance Ministry having recently warned of the spillover risks from the US . Also Read : Market rout 7 critical questions answered \" At current levels , US stock markets have greater downside risk than upside . If the downside materialises , it will have spillover effects on other markets , \" the Finance Ministry Monthly Economic Review report had said on October 23 . At the same time , it had also said that the macroeconomic outlook for the Indian economy for the current financial year is \" bright \" and \" solidly underpinned by strong domestic fundamentals \" . But what exactly and how strong are these fundamentals ? The macros are alright There is broad general agreement that India headline macroeconomic numbers are fairly decent and are on the road to improvement . Consider GDP growth , which has exceeded economists expectations in each of the first two quarters of 2023 . While growth is expected to decline to percent by March 2024 , the Reserve Bank of India RBI sees it jumping to percent in April June 2024 . And while base effects continue to play a role , it is telling that the government and the RBI optimistic expectations for percent growth this year have been panning out fairly nicely . As is always the case , the situation below the headline growth number is not as straightforward , with different data not tugging in the same , rosy direction . Take the Purchasing Managers Indices PMI , for instance , which have hit multi year highs in 2023 , with the services PMI in particular displaying stunning growth . Meanwhile , industrial growth as per the Index of Industrial Production has been more sedate . Of course , it must be noted that IIP growth and the PMIs are not similar measures of activity the first compares industrial output on a year on year basis while the latter considers several parameters through its surveys and derives an index which looks at changes on a month on month basis . Also Read : Best of both worlds economists give thumbs up to CPI , IIP data However , the latest IIP growth print was a 14 month high of percent . At the same time , the composite PMI manufacturing and services sectors taken together have been above 60 in five of the last six months , well above the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion in activity . On the price front , matters are indeed improving , with headline retail inflation returning to the RBI two to six percent tolerance range in September . In fact , the central bank repeated reiteration of its commitment to the four percent medium term target is reinforcing the credibility of the flexible inflation targeting framework , with markets postponing their rate cut expectations to from late 2023 . Perhaps more important than the recent fall in inflation is the more prolonged moderation in core inflation , which has cooled to percent . Financials internal and external If growth and inflation are seemingly on the right track , the government finances are doing even better . The Centre fiscal deficit the most crucial indicator of the health of the exchequer for the first five months of 2023 24 is a comfortable 36 percent of the full year target . August in particular was a good month for the central government as direct tax collections performed a dramatic U turn and posted stupendous growth numbers . On the expenditure side , capex has kept pace and has crossed Rs five lakh crore in October , according to a government source . Also Read : No reason for govt to deviate from medium term fiscal deficit path , says source Overall , the fiscal deficit target of percent of GDP looks eminently achievable , according to the government . The external balance , on the other hand , is a bit tricky , but mostly because of factors outside India control . The war between Russia and Ukraine continues , and geopolitical tensions have only increased due to the Israel Hamas conflict and the possibility of other nations in West Asia being dragged in . Completing the third and fourth sides of the global headache quadrilateral are the US and Chinese economies . While the rapid rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and fears of higher for longer have pushed US bond yields to 16 year highs , the real estate sector in the world second largest economy is causing severe heartburn . Despite these headwinds , India external performance merchandise exports notwithstanding has been rather stable the rupee has depreciated only slightly over the course of 2023 even though the Dollar Index has gone past 106 . And the buffers remain robust , with the foreign exchange reserves at 586 billion as of October 13 higher than what the RBI started 2023 with . All in all , as the Finance Ministry monthly report said , India will remain the fastest growing major economy in the world this year . With foreign investors expected to lap up Indian sovereign debt once government bonds are included in JPMorgan global indices starting June 2024 , money , especially for the long term , is only going to keep flowing in .',\n",

Going forward , the company expects surging green coffee and packaging prices , the latter of which have increased recently due to the Israel Gaza conflict related oil price hikes , may cause some headwinds . However , the company may be able to hold the line for pricing of coffee and coco , if no dramatic or unpredictable challenges surface , Narayanan said . At the same time , the entry of regional players and startups in the FMCG market has also caused volumes to come down marginally , but these are stabilising with time , Narayanan said .',\n",
              " 'The Rules of War : Have Hamas and Israel already broken them ? NewsNation International law specifies what countries can and ca do during wartime . Both Israel and Hamas have been accused of breaking them . The rules of armed conflict are governed by a set of international laws , including the Geneva Conventions , which almost every country has agreed to . They forbid the intentional targeting of civilians , ban torture , hostage taking and other inhumane treatments . The deliberate cruelty of Hamas vividly reminds me of blood thirsty , fanatic and hateful , said Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin . When Hamas launched several hundred missiles on that fateful Saturday and then attacked various civilian objects and towns along the border , destroying human beings , that in and of itself was a war crime , said David Crane the founding chief prosecutor of the United Nations for Sierra Leone . There is one real cornerstone , hard rock principle in the laws of armed conflict , and that is civilians and civilian objects can never be intentionally targeted . But the brutality of the attacks by Hamas does give Israel the ability to attack freely it is supposed to adhere to international humanitarian laws as well . You are a Jewish state , but you also a democracy like the United States . You do live by the rules of terrorists . You live by the rule of law . And when conflicts flare , you live by the law of war . What sets us apart from the terrorists is we believe in the fundamental dignity of every human life , President Joe Biden said . To date , Palestinian health authorities estimate over civilians including children have been killed by Israeli airstrikes . Nearly a week after the attacks by Hamas on Israel and its people , Israel ordered the evacuation of a million Palestinians in northern Gaza , cutting off water and power to the residents there . Human Rights Watch claims Israel used munitions with white phosphorus , which , while not prohibited , is criticized when used in crowded areas . The Israeli Defense Forces denies deploying white phosphorus as a weapon in Gaza . It is arguably against international humanitarian law to coerce an entire population to move . And it clearly not a well considered policy if there are no facilities available for those people when they do move , Richard Makepeace , a former British diplomat in Jerusalem , said . A United Nations Commission of Inquiry is actively gathering and safeguarding evidence of war crimes committed by all parties in the ongoing conflict . This evidence may be used in the existing investigation conducted by the International Criminal Court ICC regarding the situation in the Palestinian territories . The ICC , based in the Netherlands , possesses the authority to prosecute government officials for breaches of international law and can also order compensation for victims . However , some nations , such as the United States , Russia , and Israel , do not acknowledge the jurisdiction of the ICC . The ICC lacks its own law enforcement agency to enforce arrest warrants . Crane said that Israel knows and abides by the laws of armed conflict and therefore faces difficult choices ahead . They are in an impossible situation . They want to follow the law . You have an opponent who does not follow the laws of armed conflict . Israelis have a very hard choice . They have a military object , but if they target it , they drop the building and kill civilians , Crane said .',\n",

              " 'Mike Johnson Is the New Speaker of a Broken House This article is part of The Brief , TIME politics newsletter . Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox . Finally , after 22 days and four nominees , House Republicans on Wednesday picked Mike Johnson to replace deposed Speaker Kevin McCarthy . Finally would be the most important word in that previous sentence . Mike Johnson , a largely unknown figure in the GOP and a surprise choice , may be the least . The embarrassing intra party squabble that stretched for three weeks and paralyzed Congress grew more perilous with each passing day as government funding deadlines raced closer , a war between Israel government and Hamas erupted in the Middle East , and Ukraine defense against Russia became more iffy . The elevation of Johnson , a Louisiana lawyer who arrived in Washington the same month Donald Trump was inaugurated , came so suddenly and seemingly out of nowhere that Johnson wife could even make it to the Capitol in time to see her husband be elevated to just behind the Vice President in terms of constitutional power . She could get a flight in time . This happened sort of suddenly , Johnson said in his first speech as the new face of House Republicans , a fractured collection of competing agendas , ideologies , and personalities that may prove ungovernable in short order . With a margin of no more than five votes , Johnson is starting his attempt at governing with one of the smallest majorities for a new Speaker in a century . Even his fellow Republicans have doubts about his longevity in the role . The fourth term lawmaker from Shreveport , , told his colleagues he would run the chamber by not really running it himself . He promised a decentralized power structure and pledged that lawmakers themselves would have as much autonomy as they believed they needed . Yet he has no plans to change the rule that allowed McCarthy ouster at the hands of just a handful of troublemakers , leaving Johnson in an equally precarious position and at the mercy of the same mercurial whims of raconteurs . To listen to Johnson address on Wednesday , it tempting to think Republicans had settled on a middle of the road figure who could bridge the deep divides between the parties and even fellow Republicans . I do look forward to working with you on behalf of the American people . I know we see things from very different points of view , Johnson said , addressing both his new playground and specifically Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries . But I know that in your heart you love and care about this country and want to do what right . So we going to find common ground . But it also quickly became clear that Johnson optimism is matched only by his hard right credentials . I do believe there are any coincidences in a matter like this . I believe that Scripture , the Bible is very clear that God is the one that raises up those in authority . He raised up each of you . All of us , Johnson told the House . And I believe that God has ordained and allowed us to be brought here for this specific moment in this time . Johnson right wing views will draw plenty of attention in the coming days but he is not an extreme outlier among his fellow House Republicans . In fact , he became the vice chairman of the conference and earlier served as the chair of the Republican Study Committee , the conservative ideas factory inside the House . Colleagues described him as cordial , even to political opposites . Whereas some in the MAGA wing of the GOP delight in being in your face aggressive , Johnson takes a choir master lilt and lies in wait until the right moment . All of which , of course , makes for an entirely unpredictable Speakership . But it indisputable that Johnson is a different flavor of Republican than his predecessor . While McCarthy dabbled in his share of election denialism after Joe Biden 2020 victory Johnson was among the biggest if not loudest defenders of Trump . Johnson circulated a friend of the court brief in the House , collecting more than 100 signatures during a campaign that some found to be menacing , and on 6 , 2021 , he led the effort to keep Trump in power . He has told colleagues that the Biden presidency is one that will have an asterisk attached to it . Asked about his election denialism on Tuesday , Johnson did not answer . His colleagues told the reporter to shut up and booed her . Around the Capitol , Democratic staffers quickly settled on their theme that Johnson was merely a softer spoken version of Jim Jordan , one of the contenders who sought to follow McCarthy but was deemed too extreme or caustic to be palatable to enough Republicans . Democrats were quick to point out Johnson opposition to abortion rights , LGBTQ rights , even funding for veterans and Ukrainians . But for now , Johnson is working with the slightest of national profiles , giving him something of a blank slate with the American public . At least for now , he is no Nancy Pelosi or Newt Gingrich , the kind of Speaker who members of the opposite party could invoke and be confident that the ka ching of fundraising would follow . Johnson told his colleagues that the House first item of business would be a measure to support Israel in its war against Hamas , setting the chamber up to do its job for the first time in three full weeks . But that just one of the pressing items facing this neophyte Speaker who comes to office with one of the thinnest political resumes in decades and with the least experience in 140 years . The White House and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell alike have urged Congress to couple funding for Israel with money for Ukraine . The government is also due to run out of money in mid November and Johnson has told colleagues to expect another stopgap spending resolution , likely into the new year to avoid a holiday time threat of a shutdown . During previous votes on Ukraine and on government funding , Johnson was a nay . But a rank and file lawmaker no even one he says is mischaracterized is seldom predictive of what he will allow to come to the floor as Speaker . Or at least that what lawmakers desperate for the House to return to what passes for functionality are counting on . Then again , the last three weeks have shown not just how broken the Republican Party has become , but how much Congress is hobbling from crisis to crisis . More than specific pieces of legislation , Johnson legacy in making could well be to fix the half of the Capitol he now controls . Or at least find some spackling to patch the cracks in the plaster .

              " 'Ceasefire needed to release hostages , says Hamas A Hamas official has tied the release of hostages held in Gaza to a ceasefire in Israel bombardment of the enclave , launched after a deadly rampage by Hamas militants into southern Israel nearly three weeks ago . Israel says it is preparing a ground invasion , but has been urged by the US and Arab countries to delay an operation that would multiply the number of civilian casualties in the densely populated coastal strip and might ignite a wider conflict . Two US fighter jets have struck weapons and ammunition facilities in Syria in retaliation for attacks on US forces by Iranian backed militias since the Gaza war erupted . An opinion poll published today also suggested almost half of Israelis now wanted to hold off on a ground invasion out of fears for at least 224 hostages reported to be held there . People leave their vehicles to take cover during a rocket attack along a main road in Tel Aviv The Russian newspaper Kommersant quoted a member of a Hamas delegation visiting Moscow as saying time was needed to locate all those who had been abducted by various Palestinian factions in the Hamas attack on 7 October . \" They seized dozens of people , most of them civilians , and we need time to find them in the Gaza Strip and then release them , \" Abu Hamid said . He said Hamas , which has freed four hostages so far , had made clear it intended to release \" civilian prisoners \" . But this required a \" calm environment \" , he said , repeating an assertion that Israeli bombing had already killed 50 of those held . Palestinian militants clashed with Israeli troops in at least two areas inside Gaza , the latest of several small scale incursions , Hamas affiliated media reported , though the Israeli military did not immediately confirm the reports . Residents of central Gaza said they had heard an apparent exchange of fire as well as heavy shelling and air strikes along the border , with Israeli planes dropping flares and bombs . The EU expressed the gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza Hamas al Qassam Brigades said Israeli forces had attempted to land on a beach at the southern end of Gaza . Israel said its fighter jets had struck three senior Hamas operatives who played significant roles in the 7 October attack , though there was no announcement by Hamas . In early afternoon , rocket sirens sounded throughout southern Israel and an Israeli medic said three people had been wounded when a missile hit an apartment building in Tel Aviv . In the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza , an air strike killed the pregnant wife of a Palestinian lawyer , Jehad Al Kafarnah . \" My life , my heart , I love you , \" Mr Kafarnah wrote , weeping , on the white sheeting wrapped around his wife body . As Gaza million civilians grow more desperate under a siege that has cut power and water as well as supplies of food , fuel and medicine , the issue of aid has come before the 193 member UN General Assembly in New York . Unlike in the UN Security Council , where resolutions on aid for Gaza failed this week , there can be no veto on the resolution by Arab states calling for a ceasefire , which will not be binding but carry political weight .

The UN says Gaza needs around 100 relief trucks every day , and the official said negotiations were taking place with Israel , which wants to prevent resources reaching Hamas , to find a faster mechanism . UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said 57 UNRWA workers had been killed in Israeli bombardments , and UN human rights spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani became emotional when describing conditions for UN staff . \" Many of them are sleeping out in the open You have to make calculations about whether a ceiling collapsing on you or being hit by shrapnel is more likely to happen , \" she said .

Israel says Hamas killed some people including children in its 7 October attack . The Gaza health ministry said Palestinians had been killed in the retaliatory air strikes , including around children . Mr Biden has cast doubt on casualty figures provided by Palestinian officials in Gaza , but international aid agencies say they are broadly accurate and have been reliable in the past . In a poll in Israel Maariv newspaper , 49 of Israelis said \" it would be better to wait \" before beginning a large scale ground offensive , while 29 disagreed . A week earlier , 65 had backed a ground invasion . \" It is almost certain that the developments on the matter of the hostages , which is now topping the agenda , have had a great impact on this shift , \" Maariv said . Residents of central Gaza said they had heard what sounded like an exchange of fire as well as heavy shelling and airstrikes along the border , with Israeli planes dropping flares and bombs . Israel said its fighter jets had struck three senior Hamas operatives who played significant roles in the 7 October attack , all commanders in the Daraj Tuffah Battalion . There was no official announcement by Hamas . In the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza , an air strike killed the pregnant wife of a Palestinian lawyer , Jehad Al Kafarnah . \" My life , my heart , I love you , \" Mr Kafarnah wrote , weeping , o nthe white sheeting wrapped around his wife body .

              " 'Perils of Tunnel Warfare ; VietCong Tunnels a Lesson Pic Credit : Israel Diaries By Levina Tunnel rat is a term that brings back myriad nightmarish memories for Australian , American , and New Zealander soldiers . These soldiers , who were called tunnel rats , were trained to search and destroy tunnels in Vietnam , an experience from which not many soldiers survived . Later , Russians faced the same fate as Americans in Afghanistan , and a decade later , Israeli soldiers were faced with the same gargantuan task of clearing tunnels created by terrorists . A humble reminder : neither Russian soldiers of the Soviet Union nor American soldiers won the war against their respective enemies , who relied on complex tunnel maze . In an epoch where we have the best of technology , underground warfare takes us back to the stone age ways of fighting a war . Being ethical under such circumstances is the easiest route to defeat . There are about 1300 tunnels located under the Gazan cities . On average , each tunnel is approximately 2 m high and 1 m wide and equipped with lights , electricity , and sometimes tracks for transporting materials . The tunnels are often booby trapped with improvised explosive devices . The Dangerous Metro : Nine years ago , during one of the meetings with the Israeli security cabinet , Benjamin Netanyahu , the longest serving PM of Israel , said that the Israeli Army had thwarted an attack by 200 heavily armed Hamas terrorists who were planning to carry out an attack on Israeli cities . Their plan was to kill , loot , rape , and abduct Israelis on the Jewish high holy day of Rosh Hashanah . The tunnels connecting Gaza to Israeli communities were going to be utilised for this nefarious purpose . On September , 2014 , Israelis were lucky that the terrorist attack was thwarted , but on October , 2023 , their luck had run out . Nobody took these tunnels seriously till 2001 , when , during the second Palestinian Intifada , Hamas exploded 200 kg of TNT in a tunnel under an Israeli outpost , which destroyed the outpost of Termit in Rafah . Families living in Rafah are said to know the tunnels intimately , which were initially used for smuggling and later developed into a network of tunnels that ran for many kilometers underground . This network of tunnels has earned an epithet : the Gaza Metro ! Israeli soldiers claim that these tunnels are used for smuggling goods and transporting people . However , the not so innocuous purposes of the Gaza Metro include storing rockets , launchers , and ammunition caches . Additionally , these underground structures are sporadically used to house Hamas command and control centers , shielding them from the hawk eyes of Israeli surveillance drones and the Israeli Defence Force aircrafts . Two days after Hamas carried out the recent attack inside Israel , the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC released a video showcasing the extent of these tunnels to the Israeli military and the world . Below is a screenshot of the rockets stored underground . Screengrab from IRGC video The IRGC video is mind boggling , and that is the reason it has been released . An ideal case of psyops ! Hamas is aware of the Israeli military substantial armament and security strategies , which are centered around preemptive and protective measures . It is also aware that Hamas is a technologically and militarily inferior to Israeli forces . How does one make a behemoth enemy bend its knees ? A combination of guerilla warfare and psychological warfare is the answer . Hamas strategy is to use tunnels to deliver a devastating blow to the Israeli defense forces , rendering them incapable of mounting a counterattack and leaving the defending side , such as an IDF soldier , without the means to defend themselves or escape from the assault . This situation can be demoralizing for soldiers in a conventional army . The Israeli Army is presently encountering a behemoth and unparalleled challenge posed by tunnel warfare . It has emerged as one of the most dangerous guerilla tactics ever to be faced by conventional armies like the Israeli armed forces , the US Army , and the Indian Defence Forces . It is common knowledge that terrorists supported by Pakistan enter India through tunnels constructed by smugglers along the Indo Pakistan border . Smugglers and terrorists continue to create and use such tunnels unabated . Cu Chi Tunnels , the inspiration : In the 1960 , a technologically superior American Army fighting the Viet Cong was baffled by the complex network of tunnels that existed under Cu Chi City in Vietnam . This vast labyrinth of tunnels extended to other parts of the country too . The Cu Chi tunnels have witnessed some of the most intense battles during the Vietnam War , where American soldiers were faced with an enemy who could escape into thin air in the middle of a chase and fire at them from the secret tunnel openings . These tunnels akin to Hamas tunnels served the purpose of hiding weapons , providing safety to the enemy , and placing booby traps for the enemy soldiers who dared to enter them . But Cu Chi tunnels were far more sophisticated than Hamas concrete tunnels . There have been times when American soldiers discovered secret offices , bunker beds for Viet Cong soldiers , and booby traps inside the tunnels . Although the Cu Chi tunnels were significantly more advanced than those in Gaza , the Vietnamese did not employ concrete to line their tunnels . Tunnels in Vietnam , some of which still exist , had frequent turns and twists , as well as booby traps in which cobras , poisonous scorpions , and sharp bamboo knives with human excreta on them were hidden . These measures ensured a painful and slow death for the victims . The Cu Chi tunnels were designed with bends every few metres to disorient any opponent entering the tunnels . Those American soldiers who survived to tell their stories caused a dent in the psyche of others , and fear of Vietnamese strategies . VietCong did not believe in giving the enemy an option of immediate death . Whilst al Qaeda tunnels were located in the mountains of Afghanistan and the Viet Cong in the jungles of Southeast Asia , Hamas constructed the Metro underneath one of the most densely populated places on Earth Gaza Strip . You may also watch video on tunnels in Kashmir in our video The Economics of tunnels ! In 2021 , Hamas claimed that the total length of the tunnel network was 500 km , which is approximately the distance between London and Paris . Albeit the total length of Gaza is just 41 km and it is 6 to 12 km wide , ergo one can safely assume that the tunnel network has been created in layers and in a serpentine manner under Gazan cities . Approximately million people live here . If the claim is true , then the Israeli military is already aware of the herculean task it must undertake to destroy the Metro . According to Israel , Hamas may have spent million to construct the tunnel network over the years and may have used about tonnes of concrete . Tunnels are reinforced by concrete panels . Ostensibly , for a very long time now , Israeli authorities claim that Hamas has been constructing tunnels by diverting concrete meant for civilian and humanitarian purposes . How does Israel plan to destroy the Tunnels ? Most of these tunnels have access points located inside the kitchen of a home , in the prayer room of a religious structure , or at times in the most unexpected places , like an animal farm . In December 2022 , the United Nations discovered a tunnel under an UN run school in Gaza . Shocking , but true ! Using civilians as human shields is an age old tactic used by terrorist organizations . This factor adds to the woes of soldiers of the attacking Army . Fighting urban warfare is already a complicated affair , and tunnel warfare makes it more excruciating for the conventional army . FIBUA fighting in built up areas causes heavy losses for the conventional army . For every five terrorists killed , one soldier loses his life ; this figure has remained the same for conventional armies across the world . In the past , Israel has attempted to eliminate some of these tunnels using other methods , such as combat engineering and the construction of an underground border wall stretching several meters to deter tunnel assaults . Israeli forces also used bunker buster known as the GB against these tunnels during the Gaza War of . In 2021 , Israel requested the GBU 72 bombs from the United States to replace its . GBU 72 was developed to overcome hardened , deeply buried targets . The GBU 72 not only obliterates nearby objects but also generates a shockwave capable of inducing caverns in subterranean structures even farther from the intended targets . But bunker buster ammunition is costly ; it is said that about 125 units of GBU 72 may cost up to 36 million . In the Vietnam War , America was using Daisy cutters , a type of fuse designed to detonate an aerial bomb at or above ground level , these were often used with bombs . Though effective in destroying tunnels , daisy cutters could not deter Viet Cong from constructing new tunnels and traps . During Operation Guardians of the Walls in May 2021 , Israeli airstrikes destroyed over 100 km of tunnel network inside Gaza , and 7 months later , the Israeli Ministry of Defence announced that a 65 km underground barrier wall to deal with the threat of cross border tunnel assaults along the border with Gaza had been completed . It is evident that tunnel warfare is employed by the weaker side to wage a war of attrition against the conventional army . Experiences of conventional armies in Vietnam and Afghanistan demonstrate that tunnel warfare tactics , over time , result in fatigued soldiers and ultimately compel the stronger opponent to come to the negotiation table . The Israeli defense forces will need to find an avant garde solution for tunnel warfare . On July 17 , 2014 , 23 terrorists from the Qassam Brigade , the military branch of Hamas , survived Israeli shelling but were trapped in the tunnel for days . They were taken out of the tunnel in early August 2014 , when a ceasefire was announced . This incident is a clear sign that tunnels , even if superficially bombed , still have the probability of remaining intact . Israel biggest challenge will be to not have a city under a city in Gaza .

Reuters : China will require export permits for some graphite products to protect its national security . Could you elaborate on these national security concerns and did a particular event trigger this decision ? Mao Ning : The Ministry of Commerce has released information . For more specifics , I would refer you to the competent authorities . AFP : US Defense Department issued its 2023 report on China military power yesterday , saying that China now owns more than 500 operational nuclear warheads and will grow its arsenal to over by 2030 . Are those claims true ? Mao Ning : This US report , like previous ones , is nonfactual and biased . It calls China a threat only to find a convenient pretext for the US to sustain its military hegemony . China is strongly opposed to this . China is firmly committed to a defensive nuclear strategy and has always kept our nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required by national security . We have no intention to get involved in any nuclear arms race with any country . China has a unique nuclear policy among nuclear weapon states and has maintained a high level of stability , consistency and predictability . For any country , as long as they do not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against China , they have nothing to worry about being threatened by China nuclear weapons . The US sits on the largest and most advanced nuclear arsenal in the world . It follows a first use nuclear deterrence policy , keeps making enormous investment to upgrade its nuclear triad , advances forward deployment of strategic forces , and strengthens extended deterrence for its allies . These policies and acts heighten the risk of a nuclear arms race and nuclear conflict , and will only adversely affect the global strategic security environment . China urges the US to abandon the Cold War mentality and hegemonic logic , view China strategic intention and defense development in an objective and rational way and stop issuing this kind of irresponsible annual report so as to keep mil to mil and overall relations stable between China and the US . Reuters : Does President Xi Jinping plan to visit the Middle East following the visit of US President Joe Biden ?

Beijing Youth Daily : We have learned that recently the Chinese Embassy in Israel has been helping Chinese nationals stranded near the Palestinian Israeli conflict area relocate . Can you share some details on that ? Mao Ning : After the ongoing Palestinian Israeli conflict broke out on October 7 , more than 280 Chinese citizens were stranded in Sderot in southern Israel and faced high security risk . The Ministry of Foreign Affairs directed the Chinese Embassy in Israel to act swiftly to organize their relocation and evacuation . With the concerted efforts on the ground and back home , the stranded Chinese nationals have all left Sderot . Some have returned to China on commercial flights . According to the numbers we have at this point , since the conflict broke out , over Chinese nationals have left Israel for China or a third country . We will continue to work hard to assist our fellow citizens . Shenzhen TV : The Iranian Foreign Ministry said on October 18 that UN Security Council restrictions on Iran ballistic missiles were lifted on that day . The US and some other countries issued a joint statement on the same day announcing sanctions on Iran missile activities . What China comment ? Mao Ning : The JCPOA and the Security Council Resolution 2231 are important outcomes of the political settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue and should be implemented fully and faithfully . China supports lifting relevant restrictions and unilateral sanctions on Iran as slated in the Security Council Resolution and the JCPOA and call on parties concerned to uphold the authority and effectiveness of the two documents with concrete actions , take constructive steps to advance diplomatic efforts to resume compliance with the JCPOA , and uphold the international nuclear non proliferation regime and peace and stability in the Middle East . Bloomberg : US Ambassador Nicholas Burns called on the Chinese government to denounce terrorism by Hamas . He also cited Beijing stance toward the group as yet another challenge in the China US relationship . How do you respond to this ? And why has China mentioned the word Hamas as far as I know since the attack on Israel ? It is a group that governs Gaza . Mao Ning : On the current Palestinian Israeli conflict , China stands on the side of peace , equity and justice . We oppose all violent attacks against civilians and civilian facilities , condemn any violation of international law , and call on all parties to immediately stop fighting , protect civilians and avert a humanitarian disaster . We always believe that in dealing with international and regional hotspot issues , major countries need to be objective and just , lead by example in abiding by international law and play a constructive role for a political settlement . We will continue to work with the international community to deescalate the situation . Yonhap News Agency : According to reports , the ROK government has recently proposed to China and Japan of holding a trilateral foreign ministers meeting around November 26 in Busan and the three sides are working on the program of the meeting .

              " 'Russia conducts nuclear strike drills as upper house rescinds test ban treaty ratification Russia military conducted drills on Wednesday , overseen by President Vladimir Putin , that simulated a nuclear strike in response to a nuclear attack and involved multiple practice launches of ballistic and cruise missiles . The Kremlin announcement of the exercise came hours after the upper house of the Russian parliament revoked the ratification of a global nuclear test ban in what Moscow has described as a move to establish parity with the United States . The bill to end ratification will now be sent to Putin for final approval . The lower house approved it last week . The state television showed Putin directing the exercise via video call with top military officials . Russia Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu said the purpose of the drills is to practice dealing a massive nuclear strike with strategic offensive forces in response to a nuclear strike by the enemy . While similar drills are held every autumn , Shoigu pointed comments came amid soaring tensions between Russia and the West over the fighting in Ukraine . The vote to rescind the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the Russian Parliament follows a statement from Putin , who warned earlier this month that Moscow could revoke its 2000 decision to ratify the bill to mirror the stand taken by the , which has signed but not ratified the nuclear test ban . The CTBT , adopted in 1996 , bans all nuclear explosions anywhere in the world but the treaty was never fully implemented . In addition to the , it is yet to be ratified by China , India , Pakistan , North Korea , Israel , Iran and Egypt . There are widespread concerns that Russia could move to resume nuclear tests to try to discourage the West from continuing to offer military support to Ukraine . Many Russian hawks have spoken in favor of a resumption of the tests . Putin has noted that while some experts have argued that it necessary to conduct nuclear tests , he has yet formed an opinion on the issue . Russia Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said earlier this month that Moscow will continue to respect the ban and will only resume nuclear tests if Washington does it first . Ryabkov said Wednesday that the Russian Foreign Ministry had received proposals to resume a dialogue on strategic stability and arms control issues , but noted that Moscow does consider it possible in the current political environment . \" We are ready for it because the return to a dialogue on strategic stability as it was conducted in the past is impossible until the revises its deeply hostile policy course in relation to Russia , \" Ryabkov told reporters in comments carried by Russian news agencies .',\n",
              " 'Iran Warns of Escalation if Israel Continues Gaza Attacks Ukraine Awaits Brutal Winter with World Attention Focused on Middle East With the world attention fixed on the Middle East , officials in Ukraine say they are facing a new threat : crude Russian drones that appear to be launched with the sole intention of exhausting Ukrainian rockets fired to shoot them down . According to Ukrainian national television , the small drones carry reflectors to ensure they are detected , sometimes taking pictures to identify the sites of anti aircraft radars and missile systems . Built from cheap components readily available online , each drone is estimated to cost around , less than each of the sometimes multiple rockets fired to bring them down , Reuters said . Russian television pundits have reacted to the unexpected 7 Hamas assault against Israel with barely concealed glee , predicting conflict in the Middle East will dramatically reduce Western support for Kyiv . Many Ukrainian commentators offer the same analysis , worrying in particular that outrage at mounting Palestinian casualties in Gaza and at the Hamas attacks will devastate already fragile support for Ukraine among poorer \" Global South \" nations and divert military aid the Kyiv government badly needs . Earlier this month , Russia announced its defense spending for 2024 would be almost 110 billion , three times the level before its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and almost 30 of government spending . Ukraine intends to spend around 40 billion on defense next year , roughly half the government budget and 20 of the country entire economic output but it is also counting on tens of billions more in foreign military aid , as long as Western donors are still willing to provide it . When it comes to air defense rockets and artillery shells , Kyiv is now competing directly with Israel for Western supplies , especially from the United States . In recent weeks , Russian and Ukrainian forces have been on the offensive ahead of deteriorating weather likely to limit movement . Each has made occasional advances , with elements of two Ukrainian marine brigades reported to have broken through on the eastern bank of the Dnipro river , potentially threatening Russian artillery positions that have repeatedly shelled the recaptured Ukrainian city of Kherson . An advance there might allow Kyiv to better threaten Russian held Crimea , already under Ukrainian strikes from newly supplied Western missiles that have forced Russia Black Sea Fleet to seek another base . While Ukrainian officials would not confirm the landings , military bloggers and media citing military sources said the marines had seized at least three small settlements . Ukrainian troops on the far bank were being resupplied by small boats under heavy fire , they said . Russian forces foiled several attempts by Ukrainian units to cross the Dnipro River , Russia defense ministry said on Sunday . On Monday , the Kyiv Post reported an appeal by Robert Brovdi , commander of a Ukrainian drone unit supported through crowdfunding , for Zodiac type dinghies to support the offensive . By Tuesday , he said he had raised almost 1 million , roughly a third of the amount he said was needed to deliver up to 100 craft . Further east in the Donbas , Russian forces have been making their own assault against heavily fortified Ukrainian strongholds around Avdiivka , among the last significant settlements in the region not under the control of Russian speaking separatists . WINTER INFRASTRUCTURE BATTLE A shortage of personnel is a growing problem for both sides . US officials estimated in August that to Russian troops had been killed or wounded so far in Ukraine , with recruitment challenges forcing the Kremlin to turn to prisoners and unfit and older conscripts . Ukraine will not discuss its losses , but in August President Volodymyr Zelenskiy fired the heads of each regional recruiting command after a string of scandals over bribery and other efforts to avoid the draft . Ukrainian officials say they expect Russia to again strike Ukraine energy infrastructure this winter in the hope of freezing the population , also attacking Kyiv ability to earn money from exports . Russian drones and missiles have also repeatedly hit the port of Odessa and along the Danube , damaging harbor infrastructure . Ukraine September grain exports were 50 down on a year earlier , something traders and industry experts said was largely down to those attacks . Russia has often used Iranian drones to target infrastructure although it remains unclear if conflict in the Middle East will prompt Tehran , a strong supporter of Hamas , to limit such supplies . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was in Iran this week as part of a meeting of nations in the Caucasus , following a visit to North Korea . Both he and Russian leader Vladimir Putin also visited China , signing a 12 year deal to export grain . Ukraine will need every air defense missile it can get throughout the winter hence Russia willingness to sacrifice its most basic drones . A growing shortage of artillery shells is if anything more serious , with frontline reports suggesting Ukrainian troops are struggling to get enough ammunition to use roughly 350 donated Western caliber artillery pieces . The United States and European Union have each pledged to send Ukraine roughly a million 155 mm shells , with the US donation in part coming from strategic stocks the Pentagon keeps in Israel . On Monday , a senior Pentagon official confirmed some of those were being reallocated back to Israeli forces . NORTH KOREAN SHIPMENTS Whether the Pentagon will find replacement stocks for Ukraine is unclear . Ukrainian officials say both their war and the Middle East conflict show the West must dramatically increase its arms manufacturing capability , pointing to a new deal with Germany to manufacture weapons in Ukraine as something to be replicated . This month has also seen Ukraine announce the arrival of long range US ATACMS missiles with a range of around 100 miles 160 km , giving it much greater ability to strike Russian rear areas including airfields . Ukrainian officials said the first strikes which use cluster munitions to hit a larger area destroyed nine Russian helicopters and other equipment . Russia is believed to be lobbying for its own foreign arms supplies , including from China and North Korea . While the former appears to have limited its support to weapons components such as chips , a meeting between Putin and North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un in September appears to have seen the Pyongyang government opening its arsenals . Since August , two cargo ships have been sailing repeatedly between North Korean ports and Dunay in Russia , unloading at least sea containers then shipped by rail to armaments bunkers at Tikhoretsk in the Caucasus . The shipments were revealed last week in private satellite footage published by the London based Royal United Services Institute . Estonian officials told reporters they believed the North Korean shipment might total around shells , roughly the amount Russia fires each month . Coupled with Russia remaining stockpile estimated by Estonia at around four million shells , that would allow Russia to maintain its current rate of fire throughout 2024 , potentially outgunning Ukraine . While some East European countries have pledged to further increase weapons shipments to Kyiv , others including Italy and a new government in Slovakia have said they will cut back . By early 2025 , the Kremlin may hope Donald Trump will be back in the White House , making good on his pre election promises to halt support for Ukraine and make Kyiv sue for peace . Whether or not that happens , the coming months will bring more death and destruction , as each side works to shape the battlefield ahead of a perhaps inevitably political decision on how the conflict ends .

The World Health Organisation WHO has begged for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and safe passage of supplies and generator fuel to the long strip , which is being pounded by Israeli airstrikes and a punishing siege . The WHO said that supplies were so low that six hospitals had already closed across the strip . Many more will halt operations in the coming hours if fuel is not delivered . That will put thousands of vulnerable patients at risk of dying , including 130 premature babies , patients dependent on dialysis and those on life support machines . We are on our knees asking for that sustained , scaled up , protected humanitarian operation , said WHO regional emergencies head Rick Brennan . Israeli airstrikes overnight killed more than 700 Palestinians , according to Gaza Hamas run health ministry . That is the highest 24 hour death toll since Israel began a bombing campaign to crush Hamas in the wake of an attack by the militants two weeks ago . In total , more than Palestinians have been killed so far , including some minors , the ministry said . The figure includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week . Israel said it had launched 400 airstrikes over the past day , killing Hamas commanders and hitting militants as they were preparing to launch rockets into Israel . There are now concerns many more will die as medical centres are forced to close . The single oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip is only partially functional due to lack of fuel , putting around cancer patients at risk . The rubble of buildings hit in Israeli air strikes in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip AFP Getty On Monday the private Indonesian Hospital , the biggest in northern Gaza , was forced to switch off everything except for the intensive care unit due to a critical lack of generator fuel . The only other hospital that had still been serving patients in northern Gaza , Beit Hanoun Hospital , stopped operations because of the intense bombardment of the town . In total , the Hamas run health ministry said 40 medical centres had suspended operations at a time when the bombardment and displacement are putting enormous strain on the system . Ghassan Abu Sitta , a British Palestinian doctor who works with medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres , said from the al Shifa the situation was so dire that doctors and surgeons were having to improvise at every level including using washing up liquid to clean wounds . The number of wounded is astronomical compared to the size of the hospital , he told The Independent . Gaza largest medical complex is already at 150 per cent capacity and sheltering thousands of terrified civilians displaced by the bombings . The wounded are everywhere , they are on mattresses , on the floor of the wards and in the corridors and the emergency department , he added . He said the medical team was improvising at every level . When I have a patient I want to clean up for surgery I first wash them with washing up liquid that I bought from the corner shop then I wash them with vinegar to make sure they are antiseptic . Only then can he use Iodine based antiseptic materials sparingly . The next problem is power as the generator fuel runs out . If the electricity runs out , Shifa hospital will become a mass grave , he added . United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres speaks during the Security Council meeting AP The UN secretary general Antonio Guettes pleaded on Tuesday for civilians to be protected , voicing concern about clear violations of international humanitarian law in the Gaza Strip . He told the 15 member UN Security Council that at a crucial moment like this , it was vital to be clear that war has rules , starting with the fundamental principle of respecting and protecting civilians . US president Joe Biden , when asked by reporters at the White House whether aid was getting to Gaza as fast as needed , said : Not fast enough . On Tuesday evening , The UN said 20 trucks that had been due to deliver aid to the besieged Gaza Strip via the Rafah crossing from Egypt on Tuesday had not entered the enclave . We hope the materials can enter Gaza tomorrow , UN aid spokesperson Eri Kaneko said . In his speech to the UN Security Council , Mr Guterres said : It is important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum . The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation , he added . But the grievances of the Palestinian people can not justify the appalling attacks by Hamas . And those appalling attacks can not justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people , he said . Israel UN ambassador Gilad Erdan described Mr Guterres speech as shocking . His statement that the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder , Mr Erdan added .',\n",

I think you misunderstood what he actually said , he said . Earlier this month , Hamas launched a brutal attack on Israel after some of its militants invaded the Jewish state and murdered more than people , mostly non combatant children , women and foreign nationals .

              " 'China vetoes UN draft resolution on Israel , Palestine UN Security Council vote on a UN Security Council draft resolution regarding the conflict between Israel and Palestine at UN headquarters , New York , October 25 , 2023 . UN Security Council vote on a UN Security Council draft resolution regarding the conflict between Israel and Palestine at UN headquarters , New York , October 25 , 2023 . China on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution regarding the Israel Palestine conflict , emphasizing that the draft deviated from the spirit of previous UN resolutions . \" The draft departs from the spirit of previous UN resolutions and embeds the dangerous logic of clash of civilizations and the justification of war and use of force , \" Zhang Jun , China permanent representative to the United Nations , said in an explanation of the vote . \" Our position is based on facts , based on law , based on conscience , based on justice , and based on the strong appeals of the entire world , in particular the Arab countries . \" Last Wednesday , a draft resolution , focusing on the humanitarian situation of the Palestinian Israeli conflict , emphasizing the protection of civilians , and supported by an overwhelming majority of Council members , failed to be adopted due to the use of veto , said the envoy . On Saturday evening , the United States introduced a new draft resolution that set aside the consensus of the Council members , and instead included many elements that were still deeply divisive and went far beyond the humanitarian realm , he added . Many council members , including China , Russia , the United Arab Emirates , and Brazil , proposed amendments to the text . However , the sponsor , ignoring the major concerns of relevant members , made only cosmetic changes to the draft before the text was put in blue in order to rush the council to vote on it , Zhang said . \" China is by no means opposing the council taking actions . On the contrary , we have always strongly called for the council to play a responsible role . What we oppose is that the draft resolution is evasive on the most urgent issue of ending the hostility . It has never been able to call for an immediate ceasefire in clear and unambiguous terms , \" Zhang said . \" If a Council resolution is ambiguous on the question of war and peace and of life and death , it is not only irresponsible but also extremely dangerous . It is tantamount to paving the way for large scale military actions and giving the green light to further escalation of war , \" he noted . The envoy underscored that China is by no means indifferent to acts that harm civilians . \" We strongly condemned at the first opportunity all violence and attacks against civilians , and called for diplomatic efforts to promote the early release of hostages . What we oppose is that the draft resolution does not call on the parties concerned to stop the indiscriminate and asymmetrical use of force , nor does it call for a thorough investigation into the heinous attacks such as the one on the Al Ahli Hospital . Such selective application of international law and double standards will only push more innocent civilians to the brink of death . \" Zhang also noted that China is by no means indifferent to the sufferings of the people in Gaza . \" We have always strongly called for opening humanitarian corridors , ensuring humanitarian access , and avoiding humanitarian disasters . What we oppose is that the draft resolution selectively avoids referring to the root causes of the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza , and fails to urge Israel to lift its full siege on Gaza and to rescind the evacuation order for northern Gaza . Such an evasive and ineffectual approach will only accelerate Gaza falling into an even greater humanitarian catastrophe . \" The ambassador stressed that China is not denying Israel security concerns . \" We have always strongly advocated that equal attention should be paid to the security concerns and legitimate rights of both Israel and Palestine . What we oppose is that the draft resolution attempts to establish a new narrative on the Palestinian question , ignoring the fact that the Palestinian territory has been occupied for a long time and evading the fundamental issue of independent statehood for the Palestinian people . \" If adopted , it will completely dash the prospect of the two state solution and plunge the Palestinian and Israeli peoples into a vicious cycle of hatred and confrontation , the ambassador noted . The ambassador pointed out that China has no selfish interests in the question of Palestine . \" Any initiative that contributes to peace will receive China staunch support . Any endeavor that facilitates Palestinian Israeli reconciliation will be pursued by China with all out efforts . \" Since the outbreak of the latest round of conflict , China has actively urged the council to take meaningful actions and make binding decisions as soon as possible , the envoy said . \" We also emphasize that the actions and decisions of the Council must respect facts and history , take the right direction , and show due responsibility and accountability , so as to ensure that they stand the test of morality and conscience , \" he added . \" We are ready to continue to work with members of the Council and the international community to play a constructive role in putting an end to the hostility , protecting civilians , averting further humanitarian catastrophes , and realizing a comprehensive , just , and lasting solution to the question of Palestine , \" the envoy said .',\n",

              " 'Turkey Erdogan : UN Security Council has not fulfilled responsibility in Gaza In a post on social media platform X , Erdogan said Turkish efforts to establish calm in the region had been hindered by the collective punishment of Palestinians through air strikes and the deployment of aircraft carriers to the region . Erdogan has long criticised the UN Security Council structure , saying the five permanent members of the council , which includes the United States who vetoed Wednesday resolution , are not reflective of the international community and unable to take swift decisions . ANKARA Reuters Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday slammed the United Nations Security Council which was unable to pass a resolution for a humanitarian pause in the conflict between Palestinian and Israeli forces to allow aid to reach civilians in Gaza . The United Nations Security Council , which has become even more ineffective , has once again not fulfilled its responsibility , Erdogan said . Western countries , which leave no stone unturned when it comes to human rights and freedoms , have taken no steps other than adding fuel to the fire , he said , while criticising the biased and two faced media coverage of the conflict . On Tuesday , Erdogan said a blast at a hospital in Gaza was an example of Israel attacks devoid of the most basic human values . Israel has said the blast was caused by Palestinian militants . Erdogan said on Wednesday this amounted to genocide , the first time he used that term since the conflict began , but this time he did not name Israel as the perpetrator of the hospital attack . The heinous attack against the Al Ahli al Arabi Hospital yesterday has brought the massacre in Gaza to another level , he said . I condemn the perpetrators of this attack , which amounts to a crime against humanity and genocide against the people of Gaza , he added . Biden , visiting Israel , said that based on information he had seen the hospital blast appeared to be the result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group , echoing Israel view .

              " 'Renewed risks : The Hindu Editorial on the RBI and how global uncertainties have compounded October 27 , 2023 am Updated am IST On October 6 , the Reserve Bank of India RBI stuck to its GDP growth projection for the year , with risks from geopolitical tensions , economic fragmentation , volatile financial markets and an uneven monsoon , evenly balanced out by strengthening domestic demand . There was a belief that a period of heightened uncertainties was ebbing but as the central bank Governor signalled last Friday , new uncertainties have emerged over the fortnight since . The Israel Hamas conflict that erupted a day after the monetary policy review has widened , and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has flagged worries about implications on global food , fuel and fertilizer supplies . Given India dependence on fuel and fertilizer imports , disruptions or price spikes could hurt the macro economic framework , even if the government refrains from passing on higher prices to consumers and farmers in the election season . The RBI chief also pointed to rising bond yields , which hit a 16 year high of 5 this week , mixed data points and signals from central banks around the world , as the new unknowns even as known unknowns such as financial market turmoil have got more pronounced . A glimpse of this anxiety was visible this week , with the sharpest sell off on Indian bourses since July . There is no certainty that the RBI would still uphold its evenly balanced outlook towards the risks to growth . However , the Finance Ministry , while acknowledging that global uncertainties have compounded , seems largely sanguine for now in its outlook for the economy . Its monthly economic review released on Monday asserts that growth remains on track , inflation is easing after a temporary seasonal surge in July August , consumption demand is strengthening and investment demand is also firming up . On the imminent fears of rising crude oil prices , it noted that July September quarter prices were still way lower than the and averages in the first and second quarter of 2022 23 . The weak foreign trade picture is expected to recover and industrial job creation prospects are high for the next two quarters , while higher demand for housing and vehicle loans reflects bolstered confidence levels in households , it added . India macro fundamentals may well hold up through the latest global storm , but the government would do well to drill a little deeper into consumption and hiring trends . The last quarter has seen a sharp slump in small car sales , consumer non durables producers reporting weak rural demand and IT firms scaling down growth and hiring hopes . There is still much to be done to correct an uneven recovery , which would eventually hamper a broader investment revival .',\n",

As tensions soar over the Israel Hamas conflict , US and coalition troops have been attacked at least 19 times in Iraq and in Syria by Iran backed forces in the past week . A total of 21 US forces have suffered minor injuries , the vast majority of them traumatic brain injuries . Advertisement These precision self defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against US personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups that began on October 17 , US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement . The strikes were ordered by President Joe Biden . These Iranian backed attacks against US forces are unacceptable and must stop , Austin said in the statement . If attacks by Iran proxies against US forces continue , we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people . The strikes took place at roughly am on Friday in Syria 0130 GMT near Abu Kamal , a Syrian town on the border with Iraq , and were carried out by two fighter jets using precision munitions , a senior US official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said .

The United States has 900 troops in Syria , and more in neighboring Iraq , on a mission to advise and assist local forces trying to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State , which in 2014 seized large swathes of both countries but was later defeated . There is growing concern that the Israel Hamas conflict could spread through the Middle East and turn US troops at isolated bases into targets . Advertisement What we want is for Iran to take very specific actions , to direct its militias and proxies to stand down , a senior US defense official said . The United States did not coordinate the strikes with Israel , the official added . Last week off the coast of Yemen , a US warship shot down more than a dozen drones and four cruise missiles fired by Iranian backed Houthis . During a false alarm at Al Asad air base in Iraq last week , a civilian contractor died from cardiac arrest . The United States has sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region since the Israel Hamas conflict erupted on 7 , including two aircraft carriers , to try to deter Iran and Iran backed groups . The number of troops added to the region is in the thousands . Reuters reported this week the US military was taking new measures to protect its Middle East forces during the ramp up in attacks by suspected Iran backed groups , and was leaving open the possibility of evacuating military families if needed . The measures include increasing US military patrols , restricting access to base facilities and boosting intelligence collection , including through drone and other surveillance operations , officials say .',\n",

              " 'Penn , Drexel , and Temple students demand recognition of Gaza from universities amid fears of doxing and retaliation Penn and Drexel students gathered for a protest to call for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the Israeli occupation in Philadelphia , on Wednesday , 25 , 2023 . The group marched from and Market Streets to the Penn campus Read more Hundreds of students at Philadelphia three largest universities protested in solidarity with Palestinian people in the war torn Gaza Strip on Wednesday , criticizing the academic institutions over what they say has been a lopsided pro Israel atmosphere since war broke out 7 . The rallies at Temple University , Drexel University , and the University of Pennsylvania part of a groundswell of walkouts at campuses nationwide come amid accelerating tensions between students , faculty , administration , and even major donors over how the academic institutions align themselves in the overseas conflict . Wednesday walkout came a week after hundreds of Penn community members marched in unity with Israel , similarly criticizing the Ivy League administration over what they called an inert response to allegedly antisemitic rhetoric on campus , according to the Daily Pennsylvanian , the student newspaper . Protesters on both sides have shared common grievances in recent weeks a desire for university leaders to more loudly validate their causes , and a fear over public safety for both Jewish and Palestinian students on campus . Advertisement Nada Abuasi , a Drexel graduate student who has family and friends in both Palestinian territories , said university officials have not offered adequate public support to Palestinian students such as herself . Many , she said , feared that too public expressions of solidarity could also lead to severe repercussions . Folks have to censor what they say , Abuasi told The Inquirer on Wednesday . They have to not speak about certain things because they afraid of how professors will react , they afraid of how the administration will react and the reason this fear exists is because they seen it happen to others . In University City , Abuasi and about 200 students marched from the dragon statue at Drexel into the heart of Penn campus , chanting messages of support while chiding university leaders to publicly recognize the Gazans suffering in the war , which has now killed more than people in Israel and more than people in Gaza . In North Philadelphia , about 100 Temple students , many clad in kaffiyehs that covered their mouths , gathered under the campus bell tower , leveling similar claims against university leadership . Students for Justice in Palestine , which organized the Temple rally , blasted Temple president Richard Englert for his 13 statement that condemned the Hamas attack while also vowing to maintain a diversity of thought about the conflict on campus . Englert statement mentioned both the horrific violence in Israel and the ongoing violence in Gaza , but the student group said the memo offered one sided sympathy for Israel . A petition started by the group , which had been signed more than times as of Wednesday evening , claimed that it created a chilling effect for Palestinian students who fear that activism on campus would lead to smear campaigns , doxing , and the distortion of their narratives to portray them as terrorists . A Temple spokesperson said Englert did not plan to make an additional public statement , but shared a private email he sent to the student group responding to criticisms that his previous university wide memos were not emphatic enough about the loss of life in Gaza . In the message , he told the group that the civilian death toll was heart wrenching and a deep concern for the university . As president of this university , it is not possible for me to reflect all the views of our Temple community , Englert wrote to the group . What I can do , though , is to emphasize the values that this institution holds dear , including respect for all people and the rejection of violence and terrorism in any form . A Drexel spokesperson said the university is committed to creating an environment where community members can safely engage in challenging and even uncomfortable conversations and said that president John Fry had expressed his full sympathy to Drexel community members who have loved ones in both Israel and Gaza . Penn did not immediately respond to a request for comment . Many demonstrators at both campuses on Wednesday wore face coverings and said they would not speak publicly with the media , for fear of being targeted by university officials or losing financial aid due to the increasingly inflammatory tenor of the Israeli Palestinian debate . Several pointed to a recent doxing incident at Harvard University , where students who signed an anonymous letter blaming Israel for the 7 Hamas massacre were later identified and accused of antisemitism , their photos publicized on a digital billboard that was driven around campus . Toward the end of the rally on Penn campus , a man walked through the crowd with his cell phone , attempting to film the faces of dozens of demonstrators . He left the scene without incident after being confronted but the interaction left many on edge and spoke to the fraught moment unfolding on campuses . The surveillance , harassment , and intimidation of these young people is like no other , said Devan Spear , a Penn alumna and activist who alleged that she had been targeted for supporting pro Palestinian groups on campus more than a decade ago . I know a lot of students and faculty are being threatened right with the loss of jobs or job possibilities , Nour Qutyan , a Temple graduate and former leader of Students for Justice in Palestine , told the crowd in North Philadelphia . I do want this to be a moment where your fear silences you . Tensions over the conflict had been bubbling in the months before the war . The Palestinian Writes literary festival at Penn last month erupted in controversy over the inclusion of speakers who had been accused of antisemitism . The university handling of the festival led to several heavyweight donors threatening to close their checkbooks , with at least one calling on university leaders to resign . Some demonstrators said they did have high hopes over the situation at their schools . But Shane Mosley , 21 , a former Drexel student who now attends the Community College of Philadelphia , said he is hopeful that students could pressure their institutions to , at the minimum , clarify their support for students who show support for people in Gaza and the West Bank . I think behind the scenes , there a lot of turmoil , a lot of division , he said . If this movement keeps up , then something got ta give .',\n",

He was part of the existing Republican House leadership , whose top three officeholders Kevin McCarthy , Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer had been rejected by hard line conservatives over the past three weeks . Nor is he an ideological bomb thrower like Jim Jordan , who was beloved by Donald Trump and the party populist right . Instead , Johnson was trusted by party right wing without the baggage that made enemies elsewhere . He has taken controversial positions supporting a nationwide abortion ban , backing Trump efforts to reverse the 2020 election results and fighting against gay marriage rights but done so quietly and , for the most part , outside the view of television cameras . And his lack of ambition from the outset , by not entering his name as a speaker candidate until the third contest , may have made him the perfect vessel for Republicans wishing to move past weeks of political trauma and given him the ability to win votes without making specific concessions or commitments . To succeed as speaker , Mr Johnson is going to have to do more than that , however . Once the cheering and applause die down , the new speaker will have a busy legislative agenda to address with little time to do it . The Biden administration and its allies in the Senate are pressing for a multi billion dollar military aid bill for Israel , Ukraine and Taiwan . And a temporary funding measure is set to expire on 17 November , triggering a government shut down unless Congress takes action . It is during negotiations with Democrats that Johnson speakership will be put to the test . McCarthy fate was sealed when his party right flank felt he caved to Democrats in a May deal to raise the cap on new US national debt and when he temporarily avoided an October government shutdown without winning any new concessions .',\n",
              " 'Blood on street for sixth day in a row Indian markets plunged for the sixth day in a row to mark their worst run in eight months , as foreign investors continued to dump shares .

              " 'Published studies show no association between vaccines and heart attacks , contrary to British cardiologist claim CLAIM vaccines increase the risk of heart attacks more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE : Aseem Malhotra , The Joe Rogan Experience , 10 2023 DETAILS Inadequate support : Apart from a heavily flawed conference abstract and an unverifiable claim from a whistleblower , no data or evidence was provided by Malhotra to support the suggestion that vaccines increase heart attack risk . Cherry picking : Several studies have already shown that vaccination is associated with a greater risk of heart attack . No mention of these studies were made in the video . KEY TAKE AWAY Like all medical interventions , vaccines can produce side effects . Most of these side effects are mild and short lived . More serious risks , such as a rare blood clotting disorder and a type of heart inflammation have also been associated with certain vaccines , but are rare . The risk of heart problems and blood clotting , just to name a few , is greater with than with the vaccines . By reducing the risk of infection and severe disease in people , the vaccines benefit outweighs their risk . FULL CLAIM : A whistleblower from a prestigious university in the UK said that vaccinated people had increased inflammation of the arteries of the heart which increase heart attack risk REVIEW A Facebook reel posted on 10 October 2023 showed British cardiologist Aseem Malhotra on the podcast The Joe Rogan Experience , claiming that whistleblower from a prestigious university in the UK told him people who had been vaccinated against had increased inflammation of the arteries of the heart that was there in the unvaccinated , which again would increase heart attack risk . He also alleged that the whistleblower had been obliged to keep these findings hidden . Prior to the pandemic , Malhotra was known for promoting controversial claims about the benefits of the Pioppi diet . He also claimed that statins drugs used to reduce cholesterol levels provide no benefit to patients with high cholesterol . In September 2022 , Malhotra published an article in the Journal of Insulin Resistance a journal of which he is an editor suggesting that vaccines are more harmful than helpful and that they increase the risk of cardiovascular disease . Malhotra article was panned by other scientists , who pointed out that its argument relied on cherry picked studies with methodological flaws , anecdotal data and anonymous sources , but excluded data contradicting the article argument . Health Feedback wrote about the article in an earlier review . In January 2023 , during an interview with the BBC , Malhotra suggested that excess deaths linked to heart disease were linked to vaccines . This conduct was criticized by experts , and the BBC later aired an interview with physician and scientist Peter Openshaw , who pointed out that the risks of were greater than that posed by the vaccines . Malhotra interview with Rogan took place in April 2023 , during which Malhotra proceeded to air the same views as he had done before on vaccines . In the run up to his whistleblower claim , Malhotra cited a conference abstract by cardiothoracic surgeon Steven Gundry himself a controversial figure and news that Scotland had seen a 25 increase in heart attacks in summer 2021 . However , Gundry abstract had actually received an Expression of Concern from the journal on 24 November 2021 , a few months before Malhotra appearance on Rogan show . The notice stated that there is no data in the abstract regarding myocardial T cell infiltration , there are no statistical analyses for significance provided , and the author is not clear that only anecdotal data was used . In other words , no evidence was presented for the claims made in the abstract . The abstract was later corrected , removing its initial claim of dramatically inflammation and clarifying that no statistical comparisons were performed . Because the interview does provide any information about the whistleblower , nor does it provide a publicly available source for the alleged data showing increased inflammation of the arteries of the heart , we are unable to verify this claim . We reached out to Malhotra for comment and will update this review with new information if available . But we can look at whether the broader claim that vaccines raise heart attack risk is supported by evidence so far . Published studies do support this claim . A study performed in Israel and published in the New England Journal of Medicine did find a higher risk of heart attack in vaccinated people relative to unvaccinated . Figure 1 . The relative risk of various adverse events after vaccination or SARS infection . Adapted from the original figure by Barda et al . Note that the effects of vaccination and of SARS infection were estimated with different cohorts : vaccinated people were compared with unvaccinated people , while those who tested positive for SARS were compared with uninfected people . Thus , the risks from vaccination and that of infection can not be directly compared . Another study performed in the found no association between mRNA vaccination and heart . Studies performed in France also did find a higher risk of heart attack in those above 75 years and in younger . A study in Hong Kong did find a greater risk of heart attack in people with heart disease who been vaccinated against . Moreover , vaccination is associated with a lower risk of developing a heart attack after SARS infection , as one study in the and another in South Korea . In contrast , getting itself is a risk factor for developing cardiovascular problems , as studies have already . The American Heart Association states that People with cardiovascular risk factors , heart disease , and heart attack and stroke survivors should get vaccinated because they are at much greater risk from the virus than they are from the vaccine . In brief , numerous published studies have found that vaccines increase the risk of a heart attack and their findings overturn Malhotra suggestion that there reason to believe otherwise .

              " 'Crude oil deficit to high inflation : How can the Israel Hamas war impact Indian economy ? Explained The current geopolitical conflict in the Middle East due to the ongoing war between Israel and Palestinian terrorist group Hamas has brought fresh global headwinds for the Indian economy . Ever since the war broke out earlier this month , international crude oil prices have risen over 5 per cent and US bond yields have breached the 5 per cent mark to hit 16 year high levels . The economic impact of global oil supply have important implications for India a net importer of crude oil to deliver price stability . Analysts say that India continues to see macroeconomic stability at this moment , but is vulnerable to one key risk supply disruption in crude oil prices because of escalation in the war , resulting in a spike in crude oil prices . International crude oil prices may rise significantly if Iran which is a major supporter of Hamas , joins the war . If that happens , it may lead to selling pressure in the market . To explore the domestic implications better , let first understand how the Israel Hamas war can impact the global economy : Also Read : From high inflation to import bill the domino effect of rising crude oil prices on Indian economy How can the Israel Hamas war impact the global economy ? With major oil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia announcing oil supply cuts of a combined million barrels per day mbpd till the end of the year , the global economy already faces an oil market deficit . Now , with oil prices hovering above the 90 per barrel mark , the escalation of the conflict towards other Middle Eastern oil producers is concerning and requires careful monitoring , especially given the global economy higher for longer interest rate scenario . The oil supply is unlikely to be threatened unless the issue expands to other nations in the region and becomes a proxy conflict between the US and Iran . Brent had crossed the 90 mark but then retreated . Now , we can use the 90 number to be the threshold beyond which there is trouble for the world economy , said Shantanu Bhargava , Managing Director , Head of Discretionary Investment Services , Waterfield Advisors . When oil prices rise , the cost of production for various industries and energy costs for businesses and households also surge , driving global inflation higher . High energy prices and new inflationary trends could undermine the efforts of central banks to bring inflation under control . With this , central banks across the globe will continue hiking interest rates , which will slow down the global economic growth . The global economy faces high inflation again as crude oil prices rise . If oil prices stay high , the US , India , China , and other major nations that import oil may see substantial import inflation . Let take a look at how the war can impact the Indian economy : How can the Israel Hamas war impact the Indian economy ? High import bill , wider current account deficit : India a net importer of crude oil which fulfills as much as 85 per cent of its energy needs through imports , may see a heavier import bill if international crude oil prices keep rising throughout the year . It can result in a trade deficit , as India has to spend more on oil imports , which can , in turn , put pressure on the country current account balance . High crude oil prices hurt India impacting currency stability , possibly worsening the government fiscal deficit the government is likely to absorb higher prices by cutting excise duty , widening the current account deficit CAD further impacting currency adversely and affecting the profit margins of sectors such as aviation , paints , tyres and chemicals , said Waterfields Shantanu Bhargava . CAD is a key indicator of the balance of payment of a country and in the current scenario of the momentum picked up by crude rates , every 10 dollar rise in Brent futures potentially widens the CAD by per cent , according to market experts . Every 10 dollar rise in Brent crude prices widens India current account deficit by per cent . Consequently this depreciates the INR and leads to imported inflation , said V K Vijayakumar , Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services . Weaker Indian Rupee High oil prices pushes the US dollar above against its peers , which in turn , is a downside for the Indian rupee . Since India pays for oil imports in dollars , a higher oil import bill can lead to an increase in demand for dollars , potentially weakening the rupee against the dollar . Refining Margins of OMCs : If the crude oil price continues to rise , it could have a significant impact on some specific stocks and the broader economy . The Indian crude oil basket has averaged per barrel in the first five months of . But the price of the Indian crude basket touched per barrel in the first week of September . If Brent crude prices remain elevated for the remainder of the fiscal year , we anticipate that the full year average price for Indian crude oil basket could be 87 per barrel , according to estimates given by brokerages . High international oil prices will raise the average Indian crude basket price and the oil marketing companies OMCs including Indian Oil , Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd BPCL and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd HPCL , will register losses in gross refinery margins . As we approach the pre election period , we anticipate that OMCs will absorb a significant portion of the elevated global crude prices . The government may also consider partially sharing this burden with OMCs by reducing certain duties and taxes on retail fuel prices , said CareEdge Ratings . Also Read : Indian crude basket to average 87 bbl , OMCs to bear the brunt as oil surges 6 over Israel Hamas war Inflation : An increase in international oil prices may lead to higher fuel prices , which can trigger inflationary pressures . According to the Reserve Bank of India RBI , the sustained increase in prices is expected to lead to a lower aggregate demand as households and firms are left with less disposable incomes to spend on non energy goods . This is how domestic consumer prices respond to an oil supply news shock . Surprise changes in oil prices can also influence the price and wage setting in the economy by altering the inflation expectations of firms and households , and so , domestic economic activity falls on impact of such a shock . High fiscal deficit : The government often subsidizes fuel prices to protect consumers from the full impact of rising oil prices . If the crude oil prices remain at their elevated level for longer , the government may need to increase subsidies or absorb a portion of the price increase , leading to a higher fiscal deficit , according to ICICI Securities . In simple words , the government bears the difference between the market price and the controlled price of oil and gas end products such as kerosene , diesel , liquified petroleum gas LPG . This is likely to widen the fiscal deficit expressed as a percentage of the country gross domestic product GDP . \" Exciting news !

              " 'Effectiveness of the second booster against Omicron : a large scale cohort study in Chile Our cohort represents a population immunized with various schemes of vaccines . Ninety one percent of the cohort received a primary series of CoronaVac , combined with a first booster based on a viral vectored 53 or an mRNA vaccine 37 . The remaining participants 9 received a primary series and a first homologous booster of either CoronaVac CCC or mRNA vaccines . Similar to the overall effect of a second mRNA booster dose , the scheme specific vaccine effectiveness of these boosters remained high by the end of the follow up , ranging from to effectiveness against related ICU admission and to against death . The CCA vaccination scheme plus a second mRNA booster dose provided the highest protection against related deaths . Our study was not designed to demonstrate the superiority of any specific vaccination scheme . However , our results suggest that mix and match strategies may provide comparable protection against severe disease to homologous , mRNA based regimens . Our findings are consistent with previous studies on second booster doses . A recent summary of studies on mRNA , including eight studies from Israel , one from , and one from the , all conducted during the Omicron outbreak , suggests that a second mRNA booster enhances protection compared to three vaccine doses and unvaccinated individuals , particularly for severe outcomes . While not directly comparable , due to differences in study design , population characteristics , and outcome definitions , the studies in and the estimate the vaccine effectiveness of a second mRNA booster compared to unvaccinated individuals . The study in Canada , conducted among residents in long term care facilities aged 60 years or older , found that the effectiveness of a fourth dose against severe outcomes was 87 95 CI . In the USA , research was conducted among adults aged 50 years or older without immunocompromising conditions . Those results showed that the effectiveness of a fourth mRNA dose against hospitalization was 80 95 CI . These studies have a relatively short follow up time of two to ten weeks after the fourth dose and thus do not fully capture immunity waning . At least two other studies have examined the effectiveness of a second booster dose . A preprint study in Thailand examined the effectiveness of a second booster dose based on among adults with various three dose background regimes , including inactivated . The study found vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic of 73 but did not examine its effectiveness against severe outcomes . Using the same cohort , another study in Thailand found no severe outcomes for patients with a second booster dose based on , , and . The assessment was conducted after an average of 53 days interquartile range : days following their last dose . A study in Sweden examined all cause mortality among fourth dose recipients of and compared to third dose recipients and found a decrease in short term risk of death of about 70 among individuals older than 80 . Similar to our findings , the study in Sweden also found moderate waning after 2 . Likewise , a study in and in found that a fourth mRNA vaccine dose provided high protection against severe illness compared to a third dose in individuals older than 60 years . Last , anecdotal evidence from two participants in a cohort of healthcare workers in the USA suggests that a second homologous mRNA booster may induce a substantial and durable neutralizing antibody . Our study has some limitations . As an observational study , there is a risk of selection bias if the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups differ in a systematic way , such as risk aversion , which affects the probability of exposure to the treatment and the risk of SARS infection . We adjusted our estimates with observable clinical , demographic , and socioeconomic confounders that could affect vaccination and the risk of infection , but there could be residual confounding . Second , our study design did not allow us to separate the effect of immunity waning and the emergence of new SARS lineages with increased immune evasion on our vaccine effectiveness estimates against severe disease for a second booster dose based on mRNA vaccines . Our work aimed to provide policymakers with estimates of vaccine effectiveness for different populations and time periods . Through a prospective monitoring system , weekly reports on the vaccine effectiveness of booster shots were provided to the Ministry of Health . Considering comparability , we made the decision to focus on overall protection levels across different populations and stages of the vaccination campaign instead of the time elapsed since the last vaccine dose . This choice was based on the understanding that vaccination campaigns are dynamic , featuring diverse intervals between doses , which poses a challenge in establishing a consistent timeframe to assess the decline of immunity . Third , is a notifiable disease in Chile . While RT PCR and antigen tests are freely available for FONASA affiliates , it is possible that some individuals may have used an antigen test at home and not reported to the health system . Fourth , misclassification of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases is possible , as they are less likely to seek healthcare . Unvaccinated individuals might be less likely to seek testing for mild , leading to an underestimation of protection against symptomatic infection , while vaccinated individuals may develop mild symptoms due to vaccine induced protection , potentially overestimating protection against symptomatic infection . The impact of these unmeasured confounders on the estimates is uncertain ; however , it is unlikely to have affected effectiveness estimates for ICU admission and death related to . Last , the Chilean Ministry of Health has limited genomic surveillance capabilities . The ministry strategy has focused on detecting variants of concern through traveler and community surveillance but uses a non probabilistic sampling strategy . Therefore , we do not have representative data to estimate the true prevalence of these variants or sub lineages and their potential effect on vaccine effectiveness . Overall , our study shows that a second booster dose with mRNA vaccine had high effectiveness against severe , independent of the vaccine scheme received in the past . Overall protection against related ICU admission and death showed a moderate decrease of about 9 and 6 , respectively , by the end of the follow up . The introduction of the and Omicron sub lineages during the second part of the study period Supplementary Fig . and immunity waning due to a decline in the circulating levels of neutralizing antibodies as described for primary series and first booster doses may explain the decrease in . We provide evidence to support mRNA based second boosters following various background vaccine schemes , including widely used inactivated vaccines . These results suggest that a second booster would help minimize severe , including deaths , and decrease the impact on the health system . The observed duration of protection for a second booster dose suggests there may be longer acting protection after repeated immunization with both homologous and heterologous schemes and that no additional boosters are needed at six months .',\n",
              " 'Speaker Johnson supports for Israel , but says America can not be dropping money out of helicopters Newly minted House Speaker Mike Johnson told FOX News in his first television interview since gaining the gavel that the stands firmly behind Israel , while back at home , lawmakers and the Biden administration alike must find common ground and acknowledge \" God is not done \" with America yet . Johnson told \" Hannity \" the House is primed to proffer a billion support bill for Israel , slightly more than what the Louisiana Republican said Israel via the White House has asked for . However , a key difference between the House appropriation and other federal support is that the money will come in exchange for \" pay for \" in the budget , rather than simply printing the money . Johnson said the figure is a \" very specific number tied to very specific measures \" and that each dollar should be offset by a cut elsewhere . BLACK FORMER MISS ISRAEL TEARS INTO BLM FOR SUPPORTING PALESTINIANS In terms of potential military involvement in Israel fight for survival against Iran backed Hamas , Johnson said he is hopeful to avert a boots on the ground situation , but added that during a White House meeting Thursday he reminded President Biden staff that they have limited ability to directly respond without congressional approval . The Founding Fathers , he said , envisioned a \" multitude of wise counsel \" in such matters , which he noted is why Congress has the power to declare war , not the executive branch . Johnson added that he has met previously with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , and agreed that while Americans talk of \" existential threats \" stateside , Israel faces one or more daily . \" Their neighbors want to eliminate them , \" he said . \" America will back Netanyahu up they tell us when we in Israel the reason we able to sustain ourselves and survive is because everybody knows our big ally is America . \" The perception America must continue to depict is that of the premonition that the United States will defend freedom , in an effort to stave off true military conflict , Johnson went on citing former President Ronald Reagan platform in that regard . As for Republicans in his caucus who lean toward a more isolationist foreign policy , Johnson said he understands their concern that America \" can not be dropping money out of helicopters \" with a trillion debt , but also that we must show our regard for \" nations of free people around the world . \" FLASHBACK : CALLS MOUNT FOR HOUSE SPEAKER DONALD TRUMP \" But , we have to take care of our own house first , \" he added . In terms of such domestic issues , Johnson said intentional policy choices in the time since former President Donald Trump left office have led to the current economic malaise , and a potential housing bubble cited by host Sean Hannity . \" During the Trump administration , we had the greatest economy in the history of the world , \" he said , adding it was \" not by happenstance \" but through tax cuts , reining in regulation and expansion of energy production . \" We can achieve that again , but you have to do almost exactly the opposite of what the Biden administration is doing we are trying to urge our Democratic colleagues to take a look at the basic facts \" Regarding the GOP slim majority , Johnson made clear that each faction within the caucus must understand they will not get everything legislatively they want , going on to reference another Reagan idiom regarding the preference of 80 percent of what someone wants versus \" going over the cliff with the flag waving . \" In that way , he also said the will still have better days ahead , saying that \" God is not done with America yet . \" \" I think right now we in very desperate times I think the hour is late and the crisis is great , \" the Shreveport lawmaker said . CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He called for a \" Ben Franklin moment \" in which Americans inside and outside of government humble themselves to steel through the challenges ahead . At the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , Pennsylvania Franklin notably said , \" the longer I live , the more convincing proof I see that God governs in the affairs of men and without his concurring aid , we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of Babel . \" When the Founders had issues , they sought \" divine guidance , \" Johnson recounted , adding the same was true during the Civil War , Great Depression and the two World Wars . \" We have In God We Trust right above the rostrum in the Capitol , \" he went on , adding that the slogan is \" not a quaint saying \" but one that differentiates America from Communist , Marxist and monarchical regimes .',\n",

              " 'US , Russia resolutions on Israel Hamas war fail at UN Security Council The UN Security Council on Wednesday local time failed again to take action on the Israel Hamas war , with Russia and China vetoing a US led draft resolution and a text led by Moscow drawing insufficient support . The rival powers went ahead and put forward texts doomed to defeat despite what diplomats said was a last ditch effort led by France to delay a vote and work toward consensus . advertisement The US , Israel historic backer which exercised its own veto last week , put forward a resolution that would support \" humanitarian pauses \" to let aid into the blockaded Gaza Strip and back the right of \" all states \" to self defence within the confines of international law . The US led draft did not call for a full ceasefire . Russia put forward its own proposal that sought \" an immediate , durable and fully respected humanitarian ceasefire \" and \" condemned all violence and hostilities against civilians \" . FOLLOW ISRAEL HAMAS WAR LIVE BLOG UPDATES HERE Ten countries backed the US resolution but Russia and China exercised their veto power . The UAE , whose relations with Israel have warmed markedly since normalisation in 2020 but represents the Arab bloc , also voted in opposition , with the other two countries , Brazil and Mozambique , abstaining . \" It has become clear that the US simply does want UN Security Council decisions to have any kind of influence on a possible ground offensive by Israel in Gaza , \" said the Russian representative , Vassily Nebenzia . \" This extremely politicised document clearly has one aim not to save civilians but to shore up the US political position in the region , \" he said . The US ambassador , Linda Thomas Greenfield , insisted that the US had incorporated feedback from the rest of the world since its veto . Secretary of State Antony Blinken , promoting the resolution during a high level Security Council session on Tuesday , spoke of \" humanitarian pauses \" even while ruling out a formal ceasefire . \" The US is deeply disappointed that Russia and China vetoed this resolution , \" Thomas Greenfield said . \" We did listen to all of you . \" She accused Russia , often on the receiving end of criticism since its invasion of Ukraine , of \" cynical and irresponsible behaviour \" for putting forward its own text \" with zero consultations \" and \" a number of problematic sections \" . Only Russia , China , the UAE and Gabon voted for the draft resolution . The US and Britain voted no , with the other nine countries , including US allies France and Japan abstaining . UAE ambassador Lana Nusseibeh said that the Security Council needed to respond \" tangibly \" to the dire situation in Gaza . At the high level session Tuesday , she said , \" We heard dozens of statements imploring this council to assign the same value to Palestinian life as it does to Israeli life . \" advertisement \" We can not allow any equivocation on this point . There is no hierarchy of civilian lives . \" With the Security Council deadlocked , the broader UN General Assembly is scheduled to debate the war on Thursday and Friday . Resolutions from this body representing all UN members , with no one holding veto power , are non binding . Still , Arab countries were working on a resolution that could be voted on this week , diplomats said . This draft seen by news agency AFP urged an immediate ceasefire and unhindered access for humanitarian aid to reach Gaza . Israel has been bombarding since October 7 when Hamas gunmen poured across the border killing people , mostly civilians , and kidnapping 222 others , officials say , in the worst attack in Israel history . So far , more than Palestinians have been killed , mostly civilians , and there were fears the toll could further soar if Israel pushes ahead with a widely expected ground invasion in a bid to destroy Hamas and rescue the hostages .',\n",
              " 'EU Leaders Seek Aid Access to Gaza , Weigh Plight of Bloc Citizens There European Union leaders gathered Thursday to debate ways to use their combined leverage to ensure that more aid reaches Palestinians in need , and how to help EU citizens in Gaza escape danger , including some held hostage by Hamas . EU nations have long been divided in their approach to Israel and the Palestinians , but the brutal nature of the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct 7 . , which killed more than people , and the hardship of civilians forced from their homes in Gaza have shone a bright spotlight on those divisions . Across the EU spectrum , Austria , Germany and Hungary are among Israel top supporters . The leaders of Austria and Germany went to Israel to show solidarity after the assault . Spain and Ireland often focus on the plight of the Palestinians . Hamas , for its part , is on the EU list of terrorist groups . The challenge has been to strike a balance between condemning the Hamas attacks , supporting Israel right to defend itself and ensuring that the rights of civilians on both sides are protected under international law . EU envoys have wrangled in recent days over whether to call for a \" humanitarian pause \" or \" pauses , \" or even a \" window \" in the fighting , to allow aid in . Israel strongest backers oppose any language that might be seen to constrain its right to self defense . Meanwhile , the death toll in Gaza has soared past , according to Palestinian officials . It unprecedented in the decades long Israeli Palestinian conflict . A draft of the leaders summit statement , seen by The Associated Press , sees them call \" for continued , rapid , safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses . \" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said : \" I not obsessed about what language we use . What we want is the killing and the violence to stop ; to stop so that humanitarian aid can get into Gaza , where Palestinian people are suffering , and also to allow us to get EU citizens out . \" He said that about 30 Irish Palestinian citizens are stuck . \" We keen for them to be able to leave Gaza if they want to leave , and that currently not possible , \" Varadkar told reporters . Despite its limited political leverage , the 27 nation bloc is the world top aid supplier to the Palestinians . It has sent almost 78 million euros 82 million this year and over 930 million euros 982 million since 2000 . The EU has little influence over Israel the United States is its staunchest ally but remains the country biggest trade partner . The EU executive branch , the European Commission , has trumpeted what it calls an \" air bridge \" for Gaza it consists of two plane loads of aid so far and has demanded that more humanitarian assistance be allowed into poverty and conflict hit Gaza . In recent days , Israel has let more than 60 trucks with aid enter from Egypt . Aid workers and the EU say it not enough , just a tiny fraction of what came in before the war . Israel is still barring deliveries of fuel needed to power generators saying it believes that Hamas will take it . A warning by the agency for Palestinian refugees , UNRWA , over waning fuel supplies has raised alarm that the humanitarian crisis could quickly worsen . Gaza population has also been running out of food , water and medicine . The EU is UNRWA third biggest funder . Dozens of European nationals are believed to be among the more than 200 Israelis and foreigners taken hostage by Hamas . Scores more have been caught up in the turmoil as around million of Gaza million residents fled their homes under orders from the Israeli army . Exact numbers are difficult to establish as some countries prefer not to provide them for security reasons . EU officials also declined to say . Qatar has become a key interlocutor for countries hoping to have their captive nationals released . EU officials have said that Turkey could also play an important role , underscoring the need for the bloc to maintain good relations with countries in the region , beyond Israel . In the draft summit statement perhaps due to the extreme security concerns the leaders note only that they \" reviewed the state of play and the follow up on the different strands of action , including concerted efforts to assist EU citizens . \"',\n",
              " 'Underground Hamas tunnels in Gaza , a major challenge for Israeli Army Shillong , October 25 : The Israel Defense Forces IDF face a significant challenge as they plan a major ground offensive in the Gaza Strip . As per IANS , the underground tunnel network is emerging as a major source of support for the Hamas militant group , as highlighted by 85 year old former hostage Yocheved Lifshitz . The IDF assessment reveals that Hamas has an extensive tunnel network consisting of approximately tunnels covering a distance of 500 kilometers . This network is one of the largest of its kind globally , presenting a substantial challenge for the IDF . Studies indicate that these tunnels are only 2 meters wide and 2 meters high , and it believed that Hamas is using them to house hostages and store weapons and supplies . Originally , these tunnels were constructed for smuggling goods from Egypt , but with increased surveillance , especially from aerial sources , Hamas adapted them for concealing its operatives and leaders . The IDF possesses bunker buster bombs capable of destroying these underground tunnels . However , due to the high population density in the Gaza Strip , using these bombs without affecting civilians is a complex task . Despite these challenges , the Israeli military is well trained in underground warfare and is considered one of the most capable forces globally in this form of warfare . Special units trained in simulated tunnels and the use of tunnel specific sensors are in place . Additionally , the IDF utilizes robots that can be deployed inside the tunnels to detect human presence and respond accordingly .',\n",
              " 'Israel killed almost 50 hostages in Gaza bombings : Hamas Hamas said Israel aerial assault on Gaza has killed almost 50 of the hostages its militants seized in their 7 October attack . Hamas said Thursday that Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed almost 50 of the hostages its militants seized in its 7 October attack as the United Nations warned \" nowhere is safe \" in the territory . The group armed wing made the claim after Israel sent tanks , troops and armoured bulldozers into the enclave in a \" targeted raid \" overnight that the military said destroyed multiple sites before withdrawing . \" Ezzedine Al Qassam Brigades estimates that the number of Zionist prisoners who were killed in the Gaza Strip as a result of Zionist strikes and massacres has reached almost 50 , \" the group said in a statement on its Telegram channel . Hamas shock 7 October attacks saw fighters from the group infiltrate Israeli territory from Gaza , killing more than people and kidnapping 224 more , according to official tallies . Israel has since hit Gaza with relentless strikes that the enclave health ministry said have killed more than people a toll expected to rise substantially if Israeli troops massed near the border thrust across . On the day of Israel bloodiest war on Gaza yet , the UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories , Lynne Hastings , said that despite the Israeli military issuing warnings to people in Gaza City to leave , \" advance warnings make no difference \" . For people who ca evacuate , advance warnings make no difference . The United Nations intends to deliver aid wherever people in need are located . NotATarget Read my full statement about evacuation notifications to Gaza residents here : Lynn Hastings October 26 , 2023 She said in a statement that when evacuation routes are bombed , \" people are left with nothing but impossible choices . Nowhere is safe in Gaza . \" The army said overnight its forces hit \" numerous terrorist cells , infrastructure and anti tank missile launch posts \" . Black smoke billowed into the sky after a blast in the grainy night vision footage the Israeli military released hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared preparations for a ground war were under way . The operation in northern Gaza came in \" preparation for the next stages of combat \" , the military said . The black and white video showed armoured vehicles moving near Gaza border fence . Other footage appeared to show an air strike and buildings being targeted . International alarm has increased amid growing shock about the scale of human suffering inside the besieged Palestinian territory where Israel has cut off most water , food , fuel and other basic supplies . In southern Gaza , a grieving Umm Omar al Khaldi told AFP how she saw her neighbours being killed in an Israeli strike that reduced the house to rubble , with many feared buried beneath . \" We saw them getting bombarded the children got bombarded while their mother was hugging them , \" the woman said , desperately pleading for help from the outside world . \" Where are the Arabs , where is humanity ? \" she asked . Amnesty International in a statement called for an immediate ceasefire to ensure \" access to life saving aid for people in Gaza amidst an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe \" . The human rights group chief Agnes Callamard said : \" Serious violations of international humanitarian law , including war crimes , by all parties to the conflict continue unabated . \" Surging death toll The war surging death toll is by far the highest since Israel unilaterally withdrew from the small coastal territory in 2005 a period that has seen four previous Gaza wars . Entire neighbourhoods have been razed , surgeons are operating without anaesthetic , and ice cream trucks have become makeshift morgues . In chaotic scenes , volunteers and neighbours have clawed , sometimes with their bare hands , through shattered concrete and sand to pull out civilian casualties . All too often they recover only corpses which have piled up , wrapped in bloodstained white shrouds . In Brussels on Thursday , European Union leaders debated calling for \" pauses \" in the war so aid can get in . The 27 nation bloc has long been split between more pro Palestinian members such as Ireland and Spain , and staunch backers of Israel including Germany and Austria . \" What we want is the killing and the violence to stop so that humanitarian aid can get into Gaza , where innocent Palestinian people are suffering , and also to allow us to get EU citizens out , \" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said . US President Joe Biden , a strong supporter of Israel , earlier joined the calls for it to \" protect innocent civilians \" and to follow the \" laws of war \" as it pursues Hamas . French President Emmanuel Macron warned Wednesday that \" a massive intervention that would put civilian lives at risk would be an error \" . And Jordan King Abdullah II said anger at the suffering could \" lead to an explosion \" in the Middle East . Raining down hellfire Netanyahu amid the growing calls to temper the ferocious bombing campaign said Israel had been \" raining down hellfire on Hamas \" and killing \" thousands of terrorists \" . He said his war cabinet and the military would determine the timing of a \" ground offensive \" with the goal to \" eliminate Hamas \" and \" bring our captives home \" . But he stressed that \" I will not detail when , how or how many \" forces would take part . Netanyahu also acknowledged for the first time that he would have to explain the security lapses exposed on 7 October . \" The fault will be examined and everyone will have to give answers , including me , \" he said . \" But all this will happen later . \" Biden stressed that \" when this crisis is over , there has to be a vision of what comes next \" . He reiterated that Washington supports a two state solution with independent Israeli and Palestinian states . \" It means a concentrated effort for all the parties Israelis , Palestinians , regional partners , global leaders to put us on a path toward peace , \" Biden said . The war has sparked fears of a regional conflagration if it draws in more of Israel enemies such as Iran backed Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon . RELATED How Arab states could respond to an Israeli invasion of Gaza Analysis There has also been a rise in attacks on Israel top ally , which has military bases across the Middle East . About American troops are stationed in Iraq and some 900 in Syria to help fight remnants of the Islamic State jihadist group .

The images of Haniyeh joyful prayer and an Al Jazeera interview with Hamas Political Bureau Deputy Chief Saleh al Arouri , both taken in Ankara , reportedly made the Turkish government uncomfortable .

Turkey Presidential Communications Directorate , through its Disinformation Combat Center , swiftly responded to Fehim Taştekin article , categorically denying any claims that President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had issued an order for senior Hamas officials to leave Turkey . However , it worth noting that the denial was shared only in Arabic and did not address Haniyeh whereabouts during the Aksa Storm operation .

Share your email to get all the latest politics news and headlines from Bristol Live Stay in the know . Share your email to get all the latest politics news and headlines from Bristol Live A Bristol physiotherapist who volunteers for a Palestinian humanitarian organisation learned several days ago that three of her colleagues in Gaza have been confirmed dead . Earlier this week , Celia Stubbs received messages on Whatsapp from the terrified physiotherapists who now sleep in the Dar Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza between attending to patients . While Israel has ordered the million people living in Northern Gaza to make their way to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt , many hospital workers and their patients can not leave . Local authorities and aid groups in Gaza estimate that between and people are sheltering at the Shifa hospital . Celia , from Fishponds said that she was shocked by the conditions she encountered in the Dar Al Shifa hospital in 2022 but is devastated by recent events : I just been crying every night thinking about the people there and when they are going to get the water and fuel supply It just horrendous , depriving innocent civilians of water and fuel . READ MORE : Family pay tribute to Bristol mum and teenage daughter killed during Hamas attack in Israel READ MORE : Exactly when thunderstorms are predicted to hit Bristol While many of her fellow physiotherapists have moved into the Shifa hospital in Gaza city and are now living there with their families , one physiotherapist in her group has evacuated with his family , following the orders of the Israeli Defence Force IDF . In the last message she received from him , he said that he was crammed in one house with around a hundred people with no access to food , water or fuel . Celia received an email from The Palestinian Physiotherapy Association confirming the deaths of three physiotherapists she has built a relationship with in the last year after working with them in Gaza . She currently is unable to reach any of the other colleagues in the group . Osaid Alser , a Palestinian surgeon , has been collecting the names of the healthcare workers killed in Gaza since October 7 when Israel bombing campaign began after Hamas killed Israeli civilians and took around 200 hostages . Information from the Palestinian Ministry of Health and local media organisations shows that as of October 18 a total of 52 healthcare workers have been killed . Following international pressure , Israel has agreed to let aid flow into Gaza from Egypt . It marks a potential break in a punishing and highly controversial siege on the territory after Israel retaliation on Hamas saw it block access for water , food , electricity and other essential supplies to the 25 mile strip , while also carrying out air strikes . The Gaza health ministry said people have been killed in Gaza since the war began , the majority women , children and older adults . The deal to get aid into Gaza through Rafah , the territory only crossing not controlled by Israel , remains fragile . Celia , who is 46 years old and works as a university lecturer alongside her practical physiotherapy work , volunteers as part of a training programme in neonatal physiotherapy . Since her trip to Gaza in 2022 she has kept in touch with physiotherapists in the region and they have been in regular contact through a Whatsapp group where she offers training support and advice to around 20 Gazans she met when she worked alongside them in the Dar Al Shifa hospital . When mum of two Celia went to Gaza as a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians MAP in 2022 , her visit was postponed for a week and she had to rebook her flight due to Israeli air strikes causing a complete lockdown of Gaza . When she entered after taking a taxi from Tel Aviv airport she said that it felt like going into a prison but was overwhelmed by the kindness of locals who bought her presents . They were poor but kind and welcoming , she explained . Image : Celia Stubbs Despite having participated in humanitarian work for over a decade , including having witnessed the devastating impact of the earthquake in Haiti back in 2010 , Celia has found the situation for the children in Gaza the most heart breaking . A 15 year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt since the election of Hamas has led to Gaza becoming what has been described as the biggest open air prison in the world . This means that even before the most recent conflict which has seen the Israeli government cut off water , food and electricity supplies to Gaza , there were already severe shortages . Celia recalls having to use her phone as a torch to see children in the Intensive Care Unit due to constant power cuts and remembers there being a shortage of basic medicines . Celia said : Now we all heard about how the electricity supply has been cut off but even then the electricity supply kept being cut off . Just basic drugs that you would give children here for things like cystic fibrosis were not available there and there are certain cancer treatments that are not allowed into Gaza . The situation there is awful . The people feel so repressed , they got no future , they ca leave , they ca access the outside world . So many of the children we were seeing had mental health issues , from trauma from previous conflict . They all experienced bombings . There no opportunity , no hope and lots of fear . For me I was really upset by it and I kept in touch with a lot of the physios . Up until a few days ago I was messaging my colleagues , they were all really scared the situation was absolutely horrendous . There was no water in the hospital , no fuel and they were trying to look after all these patients who they could evacuate . Now their phones have run out of battery . I have heard that three physiotherapists from our group have been confirmed dead . They are civilians and aid workers just trying to work at the hospital . For me it not even about taking sides , it about innocent civilians in a desperate situation . A lot of my colleagues are living in the Shifa hospital in Gaza city . There are critically ill patients who are mostly children who ca move . Where are they going to go ? There is nowhere in the south that can take patients . Image : Celia Stubbs The Shifa hospital is now overflowing with people seeking shelter and was reported by The Guardian on Tuesday as being at breaking point . The evacuation order , impossible for patients and staff to follow , has been called a death sentence by The World Health Organisation , with Tuesday attack on the Al Ahli hospital creating additional tension for the thousands stationed at the Shifa hospital . Huge protests erupted across the Middle East , US and Europe following the al Ahli hospital blast , including a small vigil in Stokes Croft organised by Bristol Palestinian Solidarity Campaign on Wednesday evening . Medical Aid for Palestinians MAP , the organisation Celia volunteers with , has called for a ceasefire , access for aid and an independent investigation into the recent hospital attack . Image : James Manning PA In response to the deadly strike on Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza in which more than 470 people have been reportedly killed , Melanie Ward , Chief Executive of Medical Aid for Palestinians said : \" The horrifying scenes from Al Ahli demonstrate that healthcare will not be safe until there is a comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza . \" The international community must urgently demand that healthcare be protected , so that that medical workers be able to care for people without fear of coming under attack . A humanitarian catastrophe is happening right now in Gaza . Vital aid must be allowed immediately into Gaza , including food , fuel , water and medical relief . Evacuation orders affecting more than a million civilians and 25 hospitals must be rescinded , and civilians protected from attack wherever they are . Medical Aid for Palestinians has worked with Al Ahli Hospital over many years , and we stand in solidarity with its courageous staff and demand justice for the victims . There must be a thorough , swift and independent investigation into this and all instances of attacks on healthcare in Gaza , and those responsible must be held accountable . \" A new campaign group called is organising a peaceful protest for Palestine on Saturday , October 29 at 2 pm from Easton Shah Jalal Mosque on Stapleton Road to College Green .

              " 'Hamas claims it is willing to release hostages but needs time to find them As pressure is mounting on Hamas to release the hostages including foreigners it abducted after the horrific terror on Israel on 7 October , the Islamic terror group has come up with a bizarre excuse to delay the release . A Hamas leader has said that they need time to find hostages hidden in various places in the Gaza Strip . A member of a Hamas delegation that visited Russia for talks claimed this while talking to Russia semi official news outlet Kommersant . A Hamas official named Abu Hamid said that the group has always been willing to release civilians , but needs time to find them . Abu Hamid claimed that various groups of Hamas are holding the hostages , and a ceasefire by Israel is needed to allow Hamas to carry out a search , find the hostages , and release them . It is notable that Israel has continued with airstrikes targeting Hamas sites in Gaza , and preparing for a massive ground operation . Hundreds of citizens and dozens of militants from various Palestinian factions entered the territories occupied in 1948 , and after the fall of the Israeli Gaza Division , they captured dozens of people , most of them civilians , and we need time to find them in the Gaza Strip and then release them , he said . He also claimed that the Israeli bombing has killed 50 hostages so far , saying that a calm environment is needed to find the hostages and release them . Earlier Iran had said that Hamas is willing to release the hostages if Israel ends airstrikes on Gaza . On October , the Iranian Foreign Ministry claimed that Hamas potentially was ready to release the nearly 200 Israeli and other foreign nationals it has held hostage if Israel stops airstrikes on the Gaza Strip . Abu Hamid also said that in the meeting with Moscow , the Hamas delegation presented to the Russian friends the reasons for the October 7 attack . A group of high ranking members of Hamas arrived in Moscow on Thursday and held talks with senior Russian officials . The Hamas delegation led by Moussa Abu Marzouk , a senior official of the group that runs the Gaza Strip , met with Mikhail Bogdanov , the Russian deputy foreign minister . Iran Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani was also in Moscow on Thursday and participated in a trilateral meeting in Moscow on October 26 with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister and Putin Special Envoy to the Middle East Mikhail Bogdanov , and Hamas head of international relations Mousa Abu Marzouk . Hostages are kept in tunnels It is believed that Hamas has kept the hostages in the vast network of tunnels that it has built under the Gaza Strip over decades . 85 year old Israeli woman Yocheved Lifshitz , who was held captive and then released by Hamas on 24 October , has said that she was kept in tunnels under Gaza . She said that the Hamas tunnels are like a spider web , saying that she went through hell . She further said after entering the tunnel , they walked for hours . From her comments , it has been confirmed that most of the hostages are kept in tunnels under Gaza by Hamas . The tunnels also house rocket launchers and weapons of Hamas and provide shelter for the terrorists . As per an estimate , there are around 300 miles of tunnels under Gaza , some of which extend into Israel and Egypt . It is estimated that the tunnel network cost approximately 2 billion to build , most of which are made of pre fab concrete structures . It is said that Hamas basically has an underground city under Gaza City , comprising tunnels which are around 150 feet deep . In recent years , with the improvement in detection technology , Israel has been destroying tunnels that extend into its territory . Egypt has also blocked the Hamas tunnels that entered its territory . Although Israel has the capability to destroy deep tunnels using airstrikes , many of the tunnels are under residential areas . The tunnels under Gaza make a ground invasion by Israel extremely difficult . The network of tunnels is vast , complex , almost impossible to map out and difficult to enter and exit . Experts believe that due to this reason , Hamas could be able to extend the conflict by taking time to take out hostages from the tunnel network .',\n",
              " 'Disheartened : Biden stance on Israel may dent his Arab American , Muslim base US President Joe Biden may be vociferous in his support for Israel in its war against the militant group Hamas , but the White House has suddenly increased its outreach to Muslim and Arab Americans . On Thursday , Biden reportedly met with Muslim American leaders at the White House in private to discuss the \" anti Muslim attitudes . \" The meeting comes in the wake of reports that the President could see his support base erode among young , progressive voters and American Muslims who feel he is showing enough sympathy for the Palestinians . Biden came under fire on Thursday for saying that he has \" no confidence \" in the death tally from the Hamas run Gaza health ministry . According to media reports , Thursday meeting focused on the White House efforts to combat Islamophobia amid the recent incident wherein a 6 year old Palestinian American was stabbed to death by an American man in Chicago . Police say the child and his mother were targeted due to their religion and heritage background . In his speech from the Oval Office on October 10 , Biden made no mention of Gazans who lost their lives in the air raids , He failed to mention that Palestinians had died . Some Arab and Muslim Americans feel \" dumbfounded \" and \" disheartened \" at this . \" It felt like Muslim blood was cheap . All lives are not equal in the eyes of the Biden administration . There more precedent given to Israeli lives than there are to Muslim lives , \" said Niala Mohammad , director of policy and strategy at the Muslim Public Affairs Council and former senior policy analyst for the Commission on International Religious Freedom . This growing frustration among Arab Americans and Muslims could be reflected in next year Presidential elections . While Arab Americans and Muslims are just a small portion of the electorate , they can be significant in tightly contested battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania . Exit polls show a clear majority of Muslims voted for Biden in 2020 . In hotly contested Michigan , Arab Americans account for 5 of the vote . In other battleground states , Pennsylvania and Ohio , they are between to 2 , Reuters quoted Jim Zogby , president of the Arab American Institute . Biden won Michigan with of the vote in 2020 , compared to for Trump , and Pennsylvania with to Trump , a difference of less than votes . While political analysts think Arab and Muslim Americans are unlikely to back Trump , they could decide not to vote altogether . \" I do think it will cost him Michigan , \" said Laila El Haddad , a Maryland based author and social activist from Gaza , told Reuters . \" The voters are heartbroken . They do want to vote for Trump . But right now they asking themselves , How can we vote for the other side given the refusal to call upon Israel to abide by a ceasefire and the continued rhetoric that we seeing here domestically ? \" Alzayat , CEO of the Muslim advocacy group Emgage , told Politico . \" What I most concerned about is actually not whether they going to vote for Trump or not , but whether these voters are going to stay home . \" The message has reportedly reached Biden . Mmany Democratic members of Congress have alerted the White House officials about the need to address the isolation and fear their Muslim constituents were experiencing . Things have slightly changed since then as Biden repeatedly said Hamas does represent the Palestinian people and expressed concern for Palestinian civilians . He has since pushed Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza .',\n",

Calling for the immediate action of the international community to stop Israeli crimes and provide relief to the people of Gaza , General Bagheri said , \" We are deeply concerned about the continuation of vast and brutal crimes against civilians ; Such barbaric behaviour will not be tolerated and independent governments must react seriously to it . \" Major General Bagheri added , \" The continuation of the Zionist regime crimes and the direct support and aid of some countries have made the situation more complicated and can lead to the entry of other actors into this arena . \" Russian Defence Minister also stated that his country position on the necessity of establishing a ceasefire and preventing harm to civilians is clear , and stated that Russia initiative in the UN Security Council in this matter did not come to fruition due to the opposition of some Western countries . The recent defence actions of the Palestinian Resistance groups were a response to the Zionist regime crimes against the holy sites of Muslims in the Al Aqsa Mosque and the attack on the Palestinian worshipers , General Bagheri also told Qatari Defence Minister . By observing these crimes , no silence can be justified for Muslims , and with the continuation of these barbarities , there is a possibility of any reaction from the Resistance groups , Bagheri said . Referring to the role of the US in directing the criminal operations of the Zionist regime , Bagheri demanded that countries prevent the transfer of weapons and equipment from American bases in the region to the occupied territories .

              " 'mRNA Vaccine Cuts COVID Related Guillain Barré Risk Editor note : Find the latest news and guidance in Medscape Coronavirus Resource Center . TOPLINE : The risk for Guillain Barré syndrome GBS is six times higher in people with in the 6 weeks following infection , according to a new study that also showed receipt of the Pfizer BioNTech mRNA vaccine reduced GSB risk by 59 . METHODOLOGY : The nested case control study analyzed data from the largest healthcare provider in Israel for million patients aged 16 years and older , with no history of GBS . GBS cases n 76 were identified based on hospital discharge data from January 2021 to June 2022 . For every GBS case , investigators chose 10 controls at random , matched for age , gender , and follow up duration n 760 . Investigators examined the association between GBS and SARS infection , established through documentation of prior positive SARS test PCR or antigen , and any vaccine administration . TAKEAWAY : Among those diagnosed with GBS , 8 were exposed to SARS infection only , 7 were exposed to vaccination only , and 1 patient was exposed to both SARS infection and vaccination in the prior 6 weeks , leaving 60 GBS patients without exposure to either infection or vaccination . All vaccine doses administered in GBS cases within 6 weeks of the index date , and all but two doses administered in controls in the same timeframe , were Pfizer BioNTech vaccines . Compared with people with GBS , those with the condition were more than six times as likely to have had SARS infection within 6 weeks of GBS diagnosis adjusted odds ratio aOR , ; 95 CI , . People who received the vaccine were more 59 less likely to develop GBS than those who did not get the vaccine aOR , ; 95 CI , . IN PRACTICE : \" While Guillain Barré is extremely rare , people should be aware that having a COVID infection can increase their risk of developing the disorder , and receiving an mRNA vaccine can decrease their risk , \" study author Anat Arbel , MD , of Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center and the Technion Israel Institute of Technology , Haifa , Israel , said in a press release . SOURCE : In addition to Arbel , the other lead author is Haya Bishara , MD , of Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center . The research was published online October 18 in the journal Neurology . LIMITATIONS : There is a possibility of misclassification of SARS infection , which could lead to an overestimation of the magnitude of association between infection and GBS . The diagnosis of GBS relied solely on coding , which has been shown in prior studies to contain errors . DISCLOSURES : The study was unfunded . Bishara and Arbel report no relevant financial relationships . One co author , Eitan Auriel , MD , has received lecturer fees from Novo Nordisk , Pfizer , Boehringer Ingelheim , and Medison .',\n",

              " 'Sudan peace talks resume in Jeddah with limited goals October 26 , 2023 Riyadh AFP Sudan warring parties resumed talks in Saudi Arabia on Thursday aimed at ending a conflict that has raged for over six months and left thousands dead , the Saudi foreign ministry said . Since April , the war between regular forces loyal to army chief Abdel Fattah al Burhan and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces RSF , commanded by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo , has killed more than people and displaced over million . \" The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia welcomes the resumption of talks between representatives of the Sudanese Armed Forces and representatives of the Rapid Support Forces in the city of Jeddah , \" a statement said . Both sides announced Wednesday they had accepted an invitation to resume and Saudi brokered negotiations in Jeddah . Previous mediation attempts have yielded only brief truces , and even those were systematically violated . The latest talks are being held \" in partnership \" with a representative of the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development IGAD , the East African regional bloc led by close US partner Kenya , the Saudi statement said . The statement called on negotiators to abide by an earlier agreement announced on May 11 to protect civilians and a short term ceasefire deal signed on May 20 . \" The kingdom affirms its keenness on unity of ranks to stop the bloodshed and alleviate the suffering of the Sudanese people , \" the statement said . Riyadh hopes for \" a political agreement under which security , stability and prosperity will be achieved for Sudan and its brotherly people \" . Fighting not done Before the first round of talks in Jeddah were suspended , mediators had grown increasingly frustrated with both sides reluctance to work towards a sustained truce . Analysts believed that Burhan and Daglo had opted for a war of attrition instead , hoping to extract greater concessions at the negotiating table later . US Secretary of State Antony Blinken , who helped mediate at the start of the crisis , finalised details of the new talks during a recent stop in Saudi Arabia as part of a tour largely devoted to the Israel Hamas war , US officials said this week . The talks will aim for a ceasefire but it is premature to discuss a lasting political solution , the officials said . \" The new round will focus on ensuring unhindered humanitarian access and achieving ceasefires and other confidence building measures , \" a State Department official said on condition of anonymity . Alan Boswell , Horn of Africa project director for International Crisis Group , said it had \" taken far too long \" to get talks going again . \" Now we need to see a much higher level of diplomacy within the region if we want to see a serious push for a ceasefire , \" he said . \" My concern is that the talks will continue to flail about unsuccessfully on humanitarian issues before collapsing again . \" There is little reason to be optimistic , said Kholood Khair , founder of the Khartoum based think tank Confluence Advisory . The decision to revive talks is based on the assumption that the army and the RSF \" are done fighting due to the impending state collapse , suffering and misery , \" she said on X , formerly Twitter . \" They are not yet done . Despite rhetoric by the army and RSF , neither care about the human costs of waging this war . \" As talks resumed on Thursday , witnesses again reported fighting in El Fasher , the capital of North Darfur state . The RSF meanwhile announced that its fighters had seized \" complete control \" of army positions in Nyala , the capital of South Darfur and Sudan second most populous city .',\n",

Nine days after he was born , he , in his mother arms , along with his family , were expelled from their home in Palestine , becoming refugees away from a place they once called home . My grandparents were never allowed to return .

              " 'World Polio Day : UNICEF reduced cases by 99 percent worldwide World Polio Day : UNICEF reduced cases by 99 percent worldwide On World Polio Day , UNICEF says over billion children have received the polio vaccine , reducing cases of the disease by 99 over the past three decades . Oct 25 , 2023 Polio vaccination campaign in Kabul ANSA By Sr . Titilayo Aduloju , SSMA This progress is fragile and we can not afford to lose focus . On World Polio Day , on 24 October , UNICEF stressed that millions of children are still unvaccinated due to pandemics , conflict , climate disasters , displacement and growing misinformation about vaccines . The UN Children Agency said investing in the elimination of polio might spare health budgets an estimated billion in this century as compared to the cost of controlling the virus and continuing to respond to outbreaks . More cases in Africa and Asia Polio continues to cripple children in Afghanistan , Pakistan , and more than twenty countries in Africa and Asia , UNICEF said . The agency emphasized that these are also areas where the poliovirus is still prevalent and spreading . Many of these children live in the poorest , most marginalised neighbourhoods , where they have little or no access to life saving medical care and immunisations . UNICEF collaborates with other agencies to eradicate polio UNICEF claimed that in collaboration with governments , partners , and authorised providers , they have helped to vaccinate more than 400 million children against polio each year to eradicate polio worldwide . In addition , they provide 1 billion doses of polio vaccines annually , including cold chain management and logistics to ensure that countries receive safe and adequate quantities of polio vaccine , UNICEF stated . Failure to achieve eradication could lead to a global resurgence of polio , said the UN agency . This is possible with a sharp rise in wild polio cases and further spread of poliovirus variant outbreaks , he said . Effect of pandemic The pandemic has caused the most persistent drop in routine immunisation in thirty years . Governments must invest immediately in catch up initiatives to reach children who were not vaccinated against polio , measles , and other common diseases during the pandemic . Polio must be eradicated Eradicating polio will be one of the greatest testaments to the fact that vaccines work , a milestone for the Sustainable Development Goals for health , and most importantly , a huge and historic victory for all children . When we eliminate polio , it will be only the second disease in human history to be eliminated from the planet , said UNICEF . The first was smallpox . UNICEF further confirmed that the polio virus knows no geographical boundaries . It can easily spread and paralyses children even in countries that have been polio free for decades , as evidenced by reports of polio cases from Malawi , Mozambique , Israel , the United Kingdom , and the United States . The poliovirus has no regard for national boundaries . As long as polio exists anywhere , it will be a threat to children all over the world , UNICEF stressed . The UN humanitarian agency expressed its belief that the remaining obstacles to the elimination of polio could be overcome thereby protecting children from vaccine preventable diseases and future pandemics . UNICEF therefore called on national leaders to be committed to making childhood immunisation and polio eradication a top priority for children and for the continued support of donors and partners .

Image credit : Robert Barrie GlobalData . Artificial intelligence AI is making waves in medical imaging , but experts say the foundations are not always there to implement it . At the ongoing Med Tech World 2023 summit in Valletta , Malta , industry experts discussed the future of AI in medical imaging . Consultant radiologist and UK radiology tech company Hexarad CEO Dr Farzana Rahman said that healthcare is still quite far behind in technological capabilities . It less attractive than AI but it an important thing to consider , said Rahman . She added that in some NHS hospitals in the UK , digital network infrastructure even reliable wireless technology sometimes comes up short . If this hinders the return of interest for a particular digital platform , then AI implementation is harder to justify .

He called for an integrated infrastructure of data sharing , where the millions of scans and images that are used to train algorithms for medical imaging software can be shared between countries . US based radiology service provider OneImaging co founder and CEO Elan Adler added that integration to create a more solid infrastructure is needed . He pointed to the critical data aspect of algorithm training , saying that magnetic resonance scans , for example , take much longer than other imaging techniques , meaning training AI software that supports it could take longer . The sentiment is shared more widely in the industry . A 2021 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD forum concluded that : the main barriers to building a twenty first century healthcare system are not technical , but can be found in the institutions , processes and workflows forged long before the digital era . Nevertheless , the future of AI in healthcare still looks bright .

But that what happened when \" Sunday Morning \" sat down with Mitt Romney and his wife , Ann . President Biden phoned Romney last week on the eve of his diplomatic mission to Israel ; the Republican had just returned from his own visit , which he described as heartbreaking . \" Particularly to meet with the families of the hostages their lives are entirely different , \" Romney said . \" One of the people said , You do understand . We live in a different world than you do . \" At age 76 , Mitt Romney says he still cares deeply about what is happening around the world . And here at home , he worries deeply about the future of his party . said , \" You were once the party nominee , and now you a pariah in the Republican Party . \" \" Yeah , that saying it in a gentle way , yeah , \" said Romney . \" I mean , yeah , no question . I do really have a home in my party . \" I come from a tradition of , you know , Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush and George Bush and John McCain . Those are the people that have shaped our party : anti Putin , anti Russia , anti authoritarians , anti Kim Jong Un , character counts , that the character of our leaders makes a difference and it shapes the character of our country . That the party I come from . And I do recognize that in the great majority of our party today . And that , for me , is very troubling . \" Scribner This is Romney first interview since announcing he would not seek re election . Without having to worry about how voters will see him , he now concerned about how history views his legacy . That why he participated in a new biography by McKay Coppins , \" Romney : A Reckoning \" published by Scribner , part of CBS parent company Paramount Global . Upon learning that her husband was giving over his private diary to a journalist , Ann responded , \" I might said , That not a good idea ! Hey , you maybe wanna look through it before and take out a few things ? \" Mitt added , \" Now that I read the book , it like , Oh , did I really say that about this person ? Oh , my goodness ! \" Mitt Romney with his wife , Ann . CBS News The book is revealing , with unvarnished opinions and stories of what happens behind closed doors in the famously clubby United States Senate . \" I do think I heard a single member of my caucus , Republicans in the Senate , say , You know , Donald Trump is great . Are we lucky to have him as our leader ? \" Romney said . \" Donald Trump represents a failure of character , which is changing , I think in many respects , the psyche of our nation and the heart of our nation . And that something which takes a long time , if ever , to repair . \" \" In a way he almost was like a spy behind enemy lines , \" said Coppins . Romney gave Coppins , a staff writer for The Atlantic , hundreds of text messages and emails . The two met close to 50 times , often late at night when Romney would tell all . \" I think there was something therapeutic for him in being able to sit down and review his entire career , his life , \" Coppins said . \" This was not an authorized biography in the sense that he had any editorial control over the final product . So , there were some meetings that felt like therapy sessions . There were some meetings that felt almost confessional in nature . \" Romney is quoted in the book as saying , \" A very large portion of my party really does believe in the Constitution . \" How did he come to that damning conclusion ? \" When former President Trump said we should set aside the Constitution and reappoint him as president , you had Republicans cheer that , \" Romney said . \" It like , Wait a second : This is the leader of our party saying we should put aside the Constitution ? How can you believe you following the Constitution if that the case ? \" Romney , who barely escaped the mob on 6 , 2021 , was at the Capitol that day despite the concerns of his wife , Ann . \" I do get death threats , \" he said . \" And her feeling was I would not be safe and I should go . And I said , Well , this is a constitutional moment . This is a time when I have to be there . \" That day , on the Senate floor , Romney said , \" Do we weigh our own political fortunes more heavily than we weigh the strength of our republic , the strength of our democracy , and the cause of freedom ? \" A year earlier , Romney had been the lone Republican Senator to vote to impeach then President Trump for pressuring Ukraine president to find damaging information on political rival Joe Biden . It a stance that would have been familiar to his father , George Romney , one time Governor of Michigan . In 1964 when Republicans nominated far right Senator Barry Goldwater for president , George Romney took a stand against his own party . At that year nominating convention George Romney said , \" The strongest personality on Earth can not deal with the problems of this nation except upon the basis of correct principles . \" asked , \" What did you learn from your dad ? \" \" My dad is my life hero , \" Romney replied . \" As a Republican governor , he refused to endorse the nominee of his party , Barry Goldwater , for president because he thought he was weak on civil rights and extremism . So , that the person who I try and model myself after . And I not quite there . \" Family remains at the center of the Romneys life . They have 25 grandchildren and two great grandchildren . The senator says his wife is his closest advisor , and as we discovered in his private office , she always close at hand . \" Normally there a life size cardboard cutout of Ann that stands right there , and they have taken it away , they afraid you see it , \" Romney laughed . \" There it is ! They gave me this and we had a good laugh about it . But then I said , Do throw it away , I want to keep it ! \" Senator Romney shows Norah a stand in for his wife . CBS News The book reports on a 2019 phone call to Ann from Oprah Winfrey , alleging that Oprah said if Mitt ran for president , she would be his running mate . Ann Romney tells a different story : \" She was trying to figure out how Mitt could do an independent run . I remember trying to explain to her that that does work politically .

              " 'Florence Tan : Oil rises more than 1 on fears of spread of Middle East conflict SINGAPORE : Oil prices rose by over 1 on Friday as reports that the US military struck Iranian targets in Syria raised concerns of a widening of the Israel Hamas conflict that could impact supply from the key Middle East producing region . Brent crude futures for December rose , or , to a barrel by 0638 GMT . The US West Texas Intermediate contract for December climbed , also , to a barrel . The strikes on two facilities in eastern Syria used by the Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and groups it backs was in response to recent attacks on US troops in Iraq and Syria , the Pentagon said on Thursday . Those attacks have increased since the start of the Israel Hamas conflict on 7 . Though the strike did not directly impact supply , it increases fears that the conflict in the Gaza Strip between Israel , backed by the US , and Hamas may spread and disrupt supply from major crude producer Iran , which backs Hamas . A wider war could also impact shipments from , the world largest oil exporter , and other large producers in the Gulf . Both Brent and WTI are on track to post their first weekly drop in three weeks as the geopolitical premium built on these fears has ebbed as there has been no disruption of oil supply outside of the immediate region of the fighting . \" As a trader I going to have to say we are somewhat out of our league here trying to ascribe a value to geopolitics when no meaningful supply has been disrupted outside of the Levant , \" said Kelvin Yew , a senior oil trader at Ocean Leonid Investments . Israeli forces carried out their biggest Gaza ground attack in their 20 day old war with Hamas overnight , angering the Arab world . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said Israeli troops were still preparing for a full ground invasion , while the United States and other countries urged Israel to delay , fearing it could ignite hostilities on other Middle East fronts . \" It remains incredibly difficult even for the most knowledgeable regional watchers to make high conviction calls about the trajectory of the current crisis as the redlines that could bring more players onto the battlefield remain largely indiscernible , \" RBC Capital analyst Helima Croft said in a note . Goldman Sachs analysts have kept their first quarter 2024 Brent crude price forecast at 95 a barrel but added that lower Iranian exports could cause baseline prices to rise by 5 . Prices could jump 20 in the less likely scenario of an interruption of trade through the Strait of Hormuz where 17 of global oil production transit , they said in a note . Voluntary supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia , which will be in place until the end of the year , are tightening markets globally and supporting prices , analysts said .',\n",

              " 'RBI new directive for credit institutions : Pay Rs 100 compensation for each day of delay in complaint redressal In a significant move to improve the accountability and customer service of credit information companies , the Reserve Bank of India RBI has issued new regulations that mandate credit institutions CIs and credit information companies CICs to pay customers Rs 100 per day in cases where they fail to resolve complaints within 30 days . Complainants shall be entitled to a compensation of Rs 100 per calendar day in case their complaint is not resolved within a period of thirty 30 calendar days from the date of the initial filing of the complaint by the complainant with a CIC , states the Reserve Bank of India in its Framework for compensation to customers for delayed rectification of credit information notification . Credit information companies , also known as credit bureaus , collate credit data from different lending institutions to formulate credit reports that aid in evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses . Any errors or discrepancies in these reports can severely impact an individual borrowing capability and cost of credit . Therefore , the swift and effective resolution of complaints lodged against such discrepancies is crucial . Vineet Tyagi , Head of India Operations and Global CTO , and , says , These changes mark a significant stride in bolstering customer protection and satisfaction . The mandate for credit information companies CICs to compensate for delays in credit data updates not only encourages operational efficiency but also yields several advantages for consumers . Prompt data updates alleviate the impact of inaccuracies on financial transactions . Faster corrections enhance creditworthiness , potentially unlocking better lending terms . \" Also read : The pitfalls of buying car insurance through auto dealers : Here what you need to know Also read : What impact can the ongoing Israel Hamas war have on gold prices ?

Per the RBI notification , a CI shall pay compensation to the complainant if the CI has failed to send updated credit information to the CICs by making an appropriate correction or addition or otherwise within 21 calendar days of being informed by the complainant or a CIC . The CI CIC shall advise the complainant of the action taken on the complaint in all cases , including the cases where the complaint has been rejected . In cases of rejection , the reasons for rejection shall also be provided by CI and CIC . Where the grievance complaint involves inaccurate credit information provided by more than one CI , the complaint shall be registered by the complainant with the concerned CIC . The CIC shall coordinate with all the CIs concerned and furnish the complainant with a comprehensive resolution of the grievance . The complainant can approach the RBI Ombudsman , under the Reserve Bank Integrated Ombudsman Scheme , 2021 , in case of wrongful denial of compensation by CIs or CICs , as per the notification . This rule favours customers who have had to deal with the slow processing of their grievances and pushes credit information companies to operate more efficiently . It encourages them to improve their internal dispute resolution mechanisms and also helps in fostering increased transparency . Tyagi says , \" The regulations enhance transparency and trust in the credit reporting process . Furthermore , customers gain the means to hold CICs accountable for inaccuracies , ensuring their rights are safeguarded . These rule changes collectively contribute to a fairer , more customer centric credit information landscape , benefitting both consumers and the industry at large .',\n",
              " 'Hasan Minhaj responds to New Yorker profile , accusation of faking racism Hasan Minhaj , facing controversy from a September profile in The New Yorker in which stories he told in his standup routine were questioned , is responding in great detail . The comedian , 38 , released a 20 minute video Thursday reacting to what he called a \" misleading \" article , a \" deep dive in my own scandal \" in what he calls \" the most Hasan Minhaj thing ever . \" In the video , Minhaj provides context to the stories told in his standup that The New Yorker story questioned , including the time he said he was rejected for prom because of racism , an alleged anthrax scare at his home and run ins with law enforcement surveilling the Muslim community in his hometown of Davis , California . \" With everything that happening in the world , I aware even talking about this now feels so trivial , \" Minhaj says in the video . \" But being accused of faking racism is not trivial . It very serious , and it demands an explanation . \" I want to answer the biggest question that probably on your mind : Is Hasan Minhaj secretly a psycho ? Underneath all that pomp , is Hasan Minhaj just a con artist who uses fake racism and Islamophobia to advance his career ? Because after reading that article , I would also think that . \" The New Yorker story alleges that Minhaj embellishes stories and is selective in the information he presents , creating routines based on \" emotional truth \" to make points about racism in America . Hasan Minhaj says he made artistic choices in standup , New Yorker responds Minhaj explains that he took \" a beat \" to respond to the article , to process what happening in the Middle East with the Israeli Hamas attacks and all of the criticism he faced after the article publication . \" I just want to say to anyone who felt betrayed or hurt by my standup , I am sorry , \" the \" Homecoming King \" comedian says in the video . \" I made artistic choices to express myself and drive home larger issues affecting me and my community , and I feel horrible that I let people down . \" And the reason I feel horrible is because I not a psycho . But this New Yorker article definitely made me look like one . It was so needlessly misleading , \" he continues . \" Not just about my standup , but also about me as a person . Truth is , racism , FBI surveillance and the threats to my family happened . And I said this on the record . \" The fallout extended beyond fan commentary online : Minhaj was poised to take over as host of Comedy Central \" The Daily Show \" before the article publication . The show has since resumed guest hosts in search of a permanent anchor . In response to Minhaj video , The New Yorker said in a statement to USA TODAY Thursday : \" Hasan Minhaj confirms in this video that he selectively presents information and embellishes to make a point : exactly what we reported . Our piece , which includes Minhaj perspective at length , was carefully reported and fact checked . \" It is based on interviews with more than 20 people , including former Patriot Act and Daily Show staffers ; members of Minhaj security team ; and people who have been the subject of his standup work , including the former informant Brother Eric and the woman at the center of his prom rejection story . We stand by our story . \" USA TODAY has reached out to Minhaj rep for comment . Hasan Minhaj explains racism stories in Netflix specials In his Netflix special \" Homecoming King , \" Minhaj tells the story of a white girl , whom he gives the fake name \" Bethany Reed , \" that he says he asked to prom , but who rejected him because her family did want their daughter in photos with \" a brown boy . \" \" Bethany mom really did say that it was just a few days before prom , \" he says in the video , showing emails and texts with Bethany he claims the New Yorker ignored . The emails Minhaj shows indirectly reference the prom rejection , with Bethany thanking Minhaj for \" protecting \" her family and noting her parents have come \" a long way . \" \" I created the doorstep scene to drop the audience into the feeling of that moment , which I told the reporter , \" he says in the video before playing an audio clip of part of his conversation with the article writer , Clare Malone , about the scene . Hasan Minhajaddresses his unhinged Celebrity Jeopardy ! appearance : Fans hate my guts Addressing the other stories from his standup , Minhaj admitted both in the article and the video that he embellished stories about being harassed by law enforcement surveilling the mosque his family attended and taking his daughter to the hospital after she was exposed to what was thought to be anthrax in a letter sent to their home . \" I thought I had two different expectations built into my work : my work as a storytelling comedian and my work as a political comedian , where facts always come first , \" he says in the video . \" That is why the fact checking on Minhaj Netflix comedy talk show Patriot Act was extremely rigorous . But in my work as a storytelling comedian , I assumed the lines between truth and fiction were allowed to be a bit more blurry . And I totally get why a journalist would be interested in where that line sits . \" The guy in this article is a proper psycho , but I now hope you feel like the real me is not , \" Minhaj ends the video . \" Again , there is much more important news happening in the world right now that needs your attention . So I appreciate you watching , I take the note , and I hope to see you at the next show . \" After controversy , Hasan Minhaj kicks off tour in Milwaukee . We ca discuss his jokes .',\n",

              " 'New perspective argues pursuing fair AI for health care requires cross disciplinary collaboration New perspective argues pursuing fair AI for health care requires cross disciplinary collaboration Credit : Public Domain Pursuing fair artificial intelligence AI for health care requires collaboration between experts across disciplines , says a global team of scientists led by Duke NUS Medical School in a new perspective published in npj Digital Medicine . While AI has demonstrated potential for health care insights , concerns around bias remain . \" A fair model is expected to perform equally well across subgroups like age , gender and race . However , differences in performance may have underlying clinical reasons and may not necessarily indicate unfairness , \" explained first author Ms Liu Mingxuan , a candidate in the Quantitative Biology and Medicine Biostatistics Health Data Science Program and Center for Quantitative Medicine CQM at Duke NUS . \" Focusing on equity that is , recognizing factors like race , gender , etc . , and adjusting the AI algorithm or its application to make sure more vulnerable groups get the care they need rather than complete equality , is likely a more reasonable approach for clinical AI , \" said Ning Yilin , Research Fellow with CQM and a co first author of the paper . \" Patient preferences and prognosis are also crucial considerations , as equal treatment does not always mean fair treatment . An example of this is age , which frequently factors into treatment decisions and outcomes . \" The paper highlights key misalignments between AI fairness research and clinical needs . \" Various metrics exist to measure model fairness , but choosing suitable ones for health care is difficult as they can conflict . Trade offs are often inevitable , \" said Associate Professor Liu Nan also from Duke NUS CQM , senior and corresponding author of the paper . He added , \" Differences detected between groups are frequently treated as biases to be mitigated in AI research . However , in the medical context , we must discern between meaningful differences and true biases requiring correction . \" The authors emphasize the need to evaluate which attributes are considered sensitive for each application . They say that actively engaging clinicians is vital for developing useful and fair AI models . \" Variables like race and ethnicity need careful handling as they may represent systemic biases or biological differences , \" said Assoc Prof Liu . \" Clinicians can provide context , determine if differences are justified , and guide models towards equitable decisions . \" Overall , the authors argue that pursuing fair AI for health care requires collaboration between experts in AI , medicine , ethics and beyond . \" Achieving fairness in the use of AI in health care is an important but highly complex issue . Despite extensive developments in fair AI methodologies , it remains challenging to translate them into actual clinical practice due to the nature of health care which involves biological , ethical and social considerations , \" said co author Associate Professor Daniel Ting , Director of SingHealth AI Office and Associate Professor from the SingHealth Duke NUS Ophthalmology Visual Sciences Academic Clinical Program . \" In order to advance AI practices to benefit patient care , clinicians , AI and industry experts need to work together and take active steps towards addressing fairness in AI . \" Ting is also Senior Consultant at the Singapore National Eye Center and Head of AI Digital Innovation at the Singapore Eye Research Institute SERI . \" This paper highlights the complexities of translating AI fairness techniques into ethical clinical applications . It represents our collective commitment to developing AI that augments clinicians with trustworthy insights to provide quality and equitable care enhanced by technology , \" said co author Clinical Associate Professor Lionel Cheng Tim Ee , Chief Data Digital Officer , Clinical Director AI Future Health System Department , and Senior Consultant , Department of Diagnostic Radiology at Singapore General Hospital SGH . \" Clinicians must be actively engaged in iterative communication with AI developers to ensure models align with medical ethics and context , \" added senior co author Professor Marcus Ong , Director of the Health Services Systems Research HSSR Program at Duke NUS , who is also Senior Consultant at SGH Department of Emergency Medicine . \" Good intentions alone can not guarantee fair AI unless we have collective oversight from diverse experts , considering all social and ethical nuances .

              " 'Israeli warplanes strike areas near three hospitals in Gaza Strip Israeli warplanes have carried out new strikes against the besieged Gaza Strip , bombarding areas near three hospitals . According to Palestinian media reports , the early Monday attacks struck near Gaza City Shifa and al Quds hospitals , and also near the Indonesian Hospital , in the northern part of the territory . It was not immediately clear whether the first two hospitals were damaged in the attacks . However , the director of the Indonesian Hospital was quoted by Al Jazeera news channel as saying that the Israeli strikes caused \" serious damage and injuries , \" without providing details . There were no reports of casualties at or near the other two hospitals . The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said on October 14 that Israel had ordered them to evacuate al Quds hospital , adding that it was not possible to move the sick and wounded . The strikes came after on Saturday , Israeli regime authorities ordered 20 hospitals in northern Gaza to evacuate . An unnamed Israeli security official said six of the 20 hospitals had complied with the order and 10 were in the process of evacuating , adding that four hospitals had refused to evacuate . The regime order came after its warplanes killed at least 500 civilians in a strike on al Ahli Baptist Hospital in central Gaza . The Gaza Strip Health Ministry said most of the Israeli airstrike victims were women and children , adding , \" Hundreds of victims are still under the rubble . \" The attack was described by the Palestinian Civil Defense as the deadliest Israeli airstrike in five wars the regime has fought against the blockaded territory since 2008 . Israel brutal war against the people of Gaza started on October 7 after the Gaza based Palestinian resistance groups carried out a surprise attack against the regime , called Operation al Aqsa Storm , by firing thousands of rockets at the occupied territories . The operation , which was a legitimate response to recurrent acts of violence against Palestinians , touched off an incessant onslaught by the illegal entity on the besieged Gaza Strip , which has so far claimed the lives of more than people , mostly civilians , while leaving more than others injured .',\n",

It heartbreaking , he said . Every day , if we receive 10 severely injured patients , we have to manage with maybe three or five ICU beds available . We have to choose who must face death , or manage them in regular wards or do some limited care because we think as a medical team , between two patients in a life threatening situation , we have to give the ventilator to the patient who has a higher chance of improving in 24 hours .

              " 'We are witnessing tragic stories : Gaza doctors struggle with scarce supplies , evacuation warnings Dr Fadel Naim , head of the orthopaedic department in Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza , had just finished a surgery on the evening of October 17 when he heard the sound of two rockets closing in . The false ceiling in the operation theatre collapsed . Though he sustained an injury on his head , Naim managed to run out . When I came out in the courtyard , it was full of body parts , Naim told Scroll on a phone call from Gaza city . Dead people , injured people . We tried to help as many as we could . The explosion at the 41 year old hospital in south of Gaza city killed between 300 and 500 people patients , medical staff and displaced people who had taken shelther there . This was a big massacre , Naim said . Hundreds of people were thrown away . The source of attack on Al Ahli Arab hospital remains contested . Authorities in Gaza have blamed Israel but Tel Aviv claims it was the result of a misfired rocket by Hamas . Though hospitals and schools are counted as protected civilian establishments under international humanitarian law , data from the World Health Organisation shows that at least 51 health facilities have been attacked since Israel began its war on Gaza on October 7 . According to the Gaza health ministry , 49 medical staff have died in the conflict , 70 have injured and 23 ambulances have been damaged . Since the beginning of the conflict , people have died in Gaza and over have been injured . As the war on Gaza enters its third week , international agencies are calling attention to the precarious situation in territory hospitals . They are vulnerable to attack from Israeli forces , who claim that hospitals in Gaza are being used as shelters by Hamas militants . They are also running very low on supplies , putting the lives of thousands of civilians at risk . Dr Fadel Naim , orthopaedic surgeon in Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza . Photo by Special Arrangement Over the last week , international humanitarian law has been repeatedly breached in Gaza , said Dr Mike Ryan , executive director of the World Health Organisation Health Emergencies Programme during a press briefing . And it has to stop , he said . It must stop . Any attack on health workers in this situation is a violation of international law . On Saturday , the Palestine Red Crescent Society that runs the Al Quds hospital in Tel al Hawa area , said it had received a warning from Israeli forces to evacuate the establishment . The hospital has 400 patients and said it is providing shelter to people who have been displaced . My anaesthetist friend in Al Quds said they have over 100 wounded patients , said Dr Mads Gilbert , a Norwegian anaesthesiologist who has visited Gaza four times since 2006 to treat people during conflict situations . They have refused to evacuate . In 2015 , Israel barred him for life from entering Gaza . Gilbert has been waiting in the Egyptian capital of Cairo for 10 days for the Rafah border passage to open so that his team can treat those wounded in Gaza . The Rafah crossing connects the Gaza Strip with Egypt . Ryan of the WHO said those undergoing treatment in Gaza hospitals were in an extremely vulnerable state . Some were on incubators . Others were undergoing complicated operations and amputations . Some had head injuries or multiple fractures . We can not move these patients from hospital , Ryan said . Moving hundreds and thousands of these patients is a death sentence to those patients as well . Al Ahli Arab hospital , the site of the explosion , was one of the 22 hospitals in the north of Gaza Strip that was given an evacuation order by the Israeli military on October 12 , said Ahmed Al Mandhari , WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean . The order for evacuation has been impossible to carry out given the current insecurity , critical condition of many patients and lack of ambulances , staff , health system bed capacity , Al Mandhari said during a WHO press briefing . The WHO has urged Israel to reverse its evacuation orders . The United Nations has made a similar appeal . Hospitals are sacrosanct , and they must be protected at all cost , said Volker Türk , the UN High Commissioner . This is AL Quds Hospital that is facing threats of bombardment and demands for the evacuation of citizens who sought refuge in this place for PRCS October 20 , 2023 Though the Al Ahli hospital has been evacuated since the explosion , efforts to resume operations are underway . Naim said he hoped patients would be admitted again by Saturday . If we leave the hospital , we could be killed anywhere , he said . So we will continue to treat patients till the end of the war . But to restart , Al Ahli hospital needs medical supplies . We are out of fuel , water , food and medical supplies , Naim told Scroll . He has operated on at least 100 patients since the conflict started . The facility is in dire need of antibiotics and surgical equipment . Our is a small hospital , he said . We are getting many cases of fractures , specially open fractures with soft tissue defect . We need to transfer some patients to Egypt . We can not deal with such load . In Al Shifa hospital , the largest medical facility in Gaza city , doctors need surgical disposable material to dress the wounds of the injured . Patients from Al Ahli hospital were transferred here after the explosion . Gilbert told Scroll from Cairo that the Gaza health authorities said that they need disposable material , bandages , essential drugs , medication , external fixators to fix fracture , sutures for children , anaesthesia drug , antibiotics , IV fluid , in particular for children . When doctors do have the tools , how can they operate ? Gilbert said . This blockade is not only suffocating million civilians , among them one million children , it is also completely stopping the functioning of health care system . At a webinar on Friday , Dr Amber Allayan , the deputy cell manager in the Middle East of Médecins Sans Frontières said that the organisation has emptied its stocks to help the Gaza health ministry . MSF has 300 staffers in several hospitals in the Gaza Strip . We ca refill our stock , she said . We ca get supplies in . Farhat Mantoo , Executive Director for MSF South Asia , told Scroll by an e mail that their team has exhausted three weeks worth of medicine stock in three days . In Al Shifa Hospital , the very few remaining members of our team reported a shortage in painkillers , Mantoo said . They heard wounded patients screaming in pain . Naim said seven hospitals in Gaza city are currently not functioning , while about 15 are working only partially . Dr Richard Peeperkorn , the WHO Representative in the Occupied Territories , said 34 hospitals across the Gaza Strip are not operating because of severe damage . About 60 of primary health centres are shut . Blood banks have only one week of supply , Peeperkorn said . Those that are functional are fast running out of supplies too , he said during a press brief . He added that patients with diabetes , cancer , cardiovascular diseases , and those who need obstetrics care are unable to access treatment . Water and sanitation remain a major concern . The Gaza Strip has about pregnant women , of them nearly are in their last trimester and in need of delivery care , Dr Gilbert said . Dr Richard Brennan , the regional emergency director in WHO Eastern Mediterranean regional office , said during a press brief that medical supplies and equipment have been held up for days as the Rafah border crossing remains closed . We ready to go as soon as there is an opening , Brennan said . But it is extremely frustrating . A group of doctors from Jordon wait in Cairo to enter Gaza . Photo by Special Arrangement Over burdened health facilities Dr Mohammed Ghuneim , an emergency medicine doctor in Al Shifa hospital , told Scroll about the challenges he and his colleagues were facing . We have been trained in mass casualty , he said . But no guidelines in the world can prepare us for this . As the largest hospital in north Gaza , Al Shifa hospital is receiving patients from nearby areas and hospitals . We have received more than 700 casualties at the same time in over 25 minutes , Ghuneim said . There is no space . We are dealing with patients on the floor , there are no beds . The war is taking a toll on the health workers . Ghuneim has not gone home for 14 days . We are sleeping for short periods , he said . There is not a lot of food available , we are eating sparingly . There are also fears of Israeli attacks . I do think our hospital is safe either , not after bombardment in Al Ahli , he said . He has lost several loved ones over the last fortnight . His medical school teacher , Dr Omar Ferwana , arrived in a gunny bag for him to identify . His entire family has been wiped out , Ghuneim said . There was no one to identify him . Next to Dr Ferwana body , Ghuneim had to also identify his daughter Dr Aya Ferwana , who worked in the family medicine department . These are the tragic stories we all witnessing , he said . We can never forget them .',\n",

              " 'World Polio Day : UNICEF reduced cases by 99 percent worldwide On World Polio Day , UNICEF says over billion children have received the polio vaccine , reducing cases of the disease by 99 over the past three decades . By Sr . Titilayo Aduloju , SSMA This progress is fragile and we can not afford to lose focus . On World Polio Day , on 24 October , UNICEF stressed that millions of children are still unvaccinated due to pandemics , conflict , climate disasters , displacement and growing misinformation about vaccines . The UN Children Agency said investing in the elimination of polio might spare health budgets an estimated billion in this century as compared to the cost of controlling the virus and continuing to respond to outbreaks . Health workers administering polio vaccin to a child in Kabul More cases in Africa and Asia Polio continues to cripple children in Afghanistan , Pakistan , and more than twenty countries in Africa and Asia , UNICEF said . The agency emphasized that these are also areas where the poliovirus is still prevalent and spreading . Many of these children live in the poorest , most marginalised neighbourhoods , where they have little or no access to life saving medical care and immunisations . UNICEF collaborates with other agencies to eradicate polio UNICEF claimed that in collaboration with governments , partners , and authorised providers , they have helped to vaccinate more than 400 million children against polio each year to eradicate polio worldwide . In addition , they provide 1 billion doses of polio vaccines annually , including cold chain management and logistics to ensure that countries receive safe and adequate quantities of polio vaccine , UNICEF stated . Failure to achieve eradication could lead to a global resurgence of polio , said the UN agency . This is possible with a sharp rise in wild polio cases and further spread of poliovirus variant outbreaks , he said . UNICEF logo Effect of pandemic The pandemic has caused the most persistent drop in routine immunisation in thirty years . Governments must invest immediately in catch up initiatives to reach children who were not vaccinated against polio , measles , and other common diseases during the pandemic . Polio must be eradicated Eradicating polio will be one of the greatest testaments to the fact that vaccines work , a milestone for the Sustainable Development Goals for health , and most importantly , a huge and historic victory for all children . When we eliminate polio , it will be only the second disease in human history to be eliminated from the planet , said UNICEF . The first was smallpox . UNICEF further confirmed that the polio virus knows no geographical boundaries . It can easily spread and paralyses children even in countries that have been polio free for decades , as evidenced by reports of polio cases from Malawi , Mozambique , Israel , the United Kingdom , and the United States . The poliovirus has no regard for national boundaries . As long as polio exists anywhere , it will be a threat to children all over the world , UNICEF stressed . The UN humanitarian agency expressed its belief that the remaining obstacles to the elimination of polio could be overcome thereby protecting children from vaccine preventable diseases and future pandemics . UNICEF therefore called on national leaders to be committed to making childhood immunisation and polio eradication a top priority for children and for the continued support of donors and partners .',\n",

              " 'John Morales on Hurricane Otis rapid intensification and a warning about predicting storm strength I know that over the decades you come to know me as a non alarmist . I try not to worry you when there no need to worry . But what been happening lately can not be sugarcoated . This is a scary new paradigm in the tropics . And we all need to worry . Hurricane Otis struck very near Acapulco , Mexico , on Tuesday night as a monster 165 mile per hour category 5 cyclone . On Monday night , about 24 hours prior to landfall , the National Hurricane Center NHC was predicting it would do so as 70 mile per hour tropical storm . With the energy content and destructive potential of the wind increasing with the cube of the windspeed , that means that Otis reached Mexico with 13 times more destructive potential than what had been called for ! Even when the tardy hurricane warning was issued at 4 local time on Tuesday , NHC was still forecasting just an ordinary category 1 hurricane to reach Mexico Pacific coast . Get South Florida local news , weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox . Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters . I want to be clear that this is not an article about NHC skill . The collection of experts at their offices in Miami is the best in the hemisphere at analyzing and forecasting tropical cyclones . I written about how they were once hesitant to forecast rapid intensification of hurricanes but have adjusted do so more often like they correctly did for hurricanes Idalia and Lee in the Atlantic this year . In the case of Otis , NHC first noted in their Sunday advisories that the waters were \" very warm . \" Rapid intensification was first contemplated late on Monday night based on the low level structure of the tropical storm at the time . On Tuesday morning NHC indicated that models showed a 1 chance of Otis undergoing rapid intensification RI , and by midday the chance of RI was characterized as \" greater than normal . \" But RI was never explicitly called for . SATELLITE SPOTLIGHT : caught an incredible display of eye wall lightning as Hurricane Otis rapidly strengthened yesterday evening . According to , Otis was the strongest Eastern Pacific hurricane to make landfall in the satellite era . Acapulco NOAA Satellites Public Affairs October 25 , 2023 Otis then proceeded to go from a 50 mph low end tropical storm at 11 on Monday night to a 160 mph category 5 hurricane 24 hours later . Just on Tuesday afternoon , Otis grew from a tropical storm into a category 3 hurricane in the span of six hours ! Otis level of rapid intensification broke Hurricane Patricia record in 2015 for fastest strengthening hurricane in a span of 12 hours eastern Pacific . NOAA Hurricane Otis at 5 on 24 , 2023 . While Otis is a record setter , this is far from the first time the eastern Pacific has seen rapidly intensifying hurricanes this year . A whopping 80 of this year storms have undergone rapid intensification . Norma did it just before Otis , and Lidia earlier this month went from 80 to 140 mph in just 18 hours . Jova , in September , went from 70 to 155 mph in a day . The Atlantic , which has faced El Niño produced wind shear often , still has had three hurricanes undergo RI in 2023 : Franklin , Idalia which struck Florida , and Lee , which reached the once rare category 5 intensity . In the western Pacific , nearly half of all storms underwent RI . For those of you that follow developments in climate science , you known that for many years the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC had been predicting that tropical cyclone intensities would increase in a warming climate . Confidence in that forecast has gone from medium to high over the years . And while the total number of tropical storms around the globe has remained steady , the proportion of those reaching category 4 5 intensity had indeed gone up . Which leads to my warning . I am supremely confident forecasting hurricane tracks . If it not coming , it not coming ! But I am no longer as comfortable in putting everyone at ease in regard to the strength of a storm . My confidence in forecasting storm intensity is decreasing . In the battle of wind shear versus hot sea surface temperatures , it seems like the warm water is winning most of the time . Otis had wind shear over it , and it did matter . One of these days , in the not too distant future , there going to be a run of the mill tropical storm in the central Bahamas that going to ramp up to category 4 or 5 intensity before reaching Miami . Will NHC or I be able to correctly call for such rapid intensification ? If they can miss it , so can All that to say that we are in a new era , one in which climate change , through the physical changes it producing in the ocean and atmosphere , is boosting windspeeds and rainfall in hurricanes . The insurers and reinsurers see it , and it reflected in their premiums . The military sees it , and it reflected in the actions they taking to retrofit bases and prepare for climate driven crises . And 3 in 4 Americans see it , and it manifesting in how the climate crisis is ticking up in the rankings of the most important voter priorities . This hurricane season will be over in a month or so , and obviously we be watchful . But I want you to think of future hurricane seasons and this scary new paradigm . There are limits to resiliency , but preparedness has never been more important . Future hurricanes are more likely than ever to be worse than any you ever experienced . John Morales is hurricane specialist .',\n",

              " 'China replaces its defense minister months after its foreign minister was removed from office TAIPEI . Taiwan AP China has replaced Defense Minister Li Shangfu , who has been out of public view for almost two months , state media reported Tuesday . No further information was given . Li is the second senior Chinese official to disappear this year , following former Foreign Minister Qin Gang , who was removed from office in July with no explanation offered . Li , who became defense minister during a Cabinet reshuffle in March , has been seen since giving a speech on 29 . There is no indication that the disappearances of Qin and Li signal a change in China foreign or defense policies , although they have raised questions about the resilience of president and ruling Communist Party leader Xi Jinping circle of power . Xi has a reputation for valuing loyalty above all and has relentlessly attacked corruption in public and private , sometimes in what has been seen as a method of eliminating political rivals and shoring up his political position amid a deteriorating economy and rising tensions with over trade , technology and Taiwan . Li is under sanctions related to his overseeing weapon purchases from Russia that bar him from entering the country . China has since cut off contacts with the military , mainly in protest over arm sales to Taiwan , but also strongly implying that Washington must lift the measures against Li , which Beijing refuses to publicly recognize . The announcement from state broadcaster CCTV said that both Li and Qin had been removed from the State Council , China Cabinet and the center of government power . That virtually assures the end of their political careers , although it remains unclear whether they will face prosecution or other legal sanctions . CCTV also announced Lan new appointment as finance minister , and Yin as science and technology minister . China political and legal systems remain highly opaque , fueling lively discussion of possible corruption , personal foibles or fallings out with other powerful figures leading to the downfall of top officials . Along with dealing with what appear to be internal political issues , the ruling party is struggling to revive an economy that has been severely impacted by the draconian zero Covid measures , an aging population , high unemployment among college graduates and a movement of many of its wealthiest and best educated to more liberal societies abroad . Having had his ideology , known as Xi Jinping Thought , enshrined in the party constitution and with the abolishment of presidential term limits , Xi has structured the system so that he may stay in power for the rest of his life . The 70 year old also heads the party and state committees overseeing the People Liberation Army , the world largest standing military with more than 2 million personnel on active duty .

              " 'The Truth About Covid Vaccines and Your Heart ONE OF THE many questions that people still have about the vaccines is how they affect the heart . We know the effects of Covid itself on that organ . In the opening two years of the pandemic , about more people died in the United States due to cardiovascular disease than would have been expected in that same time frame . True , most of these deaths were in group of people most vulnerable to Covid : people aged 65 and older . But there was also a distinct , steep rise in heart related deaths among people aged 25 to 44 . The explanation as to why Covid affects the heart is more a theory at this point , but cardiologists believe it has to do with widespread inflammation in the body produced by the virus , as the New York Times reported in September . Infection kickstarts the immune system , which releases proteins that cause inflammation . Complications might follow for people with pre existing plaque buildup due to coronary artery disease : The inflammation can be just enough to induce a plaque rupture , leading to a clogged coronary artery , from which a heart attack will follow . For this and other reasons , it ideal to avoid getting Covid if you can . Covid vaccinations are one way to do it , yet some men worry about their effects on the heart , too . There a Link Between Vaccines and the Heart First things first : The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC notes that evidence from various countries supports a causal association between mRNA vaccines and myocarditis and pericarditis . The former is inflammation of the heart muscle , while the latter is inflammation of the lining outside the heart . The American Heart Association AHA also notes that vaccine related myocarditis can occur , with the risk highest among teenage boys and young men . Males between 12 and 29 have the greatest risk of heart complications following a vaccine . In September , the CDC released some of the most up to date information it has about the link between Covid shots and heart inflammation . One way to look at this is by incidence rate , or the probability of a certain medical condition occurring within a specific population of people . For males aged 12 to 15 , the rate of developing myocarditis or pericarditis within a week after receiving a booster shot was about 61 in one million . The incidence rate for guys who are 16 or 17 was 188 in one million . For men between the ages of 18 and 29 , the incidence rate was about 42 in one million . But Covid Affects Your Heart More Than the Vaccines The CDC also noted in that same report that the risk of adverse cardiac outcomes were to times higher after infection for males between the ages of 12 and 17 years compared to the risk associated with receiving a shot . Another CDC study from 2022 shows that males most at risk for complications following the vaccine are as much as eight times more likely to develop myocarditis from contracting than from getting a shot . Let review that : Myocarditis can be much more commonly from Covid itself than from Covid vaccines , says Lili Barouch , , who heads up Johns Hopkins Medicine sports cardiology program . Many young men who get myocarditis after vaccinations recover fine , although time to recovery can vary . One survey conducted by the CDC included responses from 309 cardiologists treating vaccinated males between the ages of 12 of 29 . Those healthcare providers reported full recovery times ranging from two weeks to five months . And preliminary safety data from Pfizer BioNTech regarding its bivalent boosters shots that protect against multiple Covid variants indicated zero cases of myocarditis in a population of males . Furthermore , cases of vaccine related myocarditis or pericarditis tend to be mild in comparison to an active infection , according to research conducted in Israel and published in the AMA journal Circulation in 2022 .',\n",

              " 'New Report from PEN America Documents Vast Book Bannings in US Prisons New York , Oct 25 AP Tens of thousands of books are being banned or restricted by US prisons , according to a new report from PEN America . The list includes everything from self help books to an Elmore Leonard novel . The common concept underpinning the censorship we seeing is that certain ideas and information are a threat , says the report co author , Moira Marquis , senior manager in the prison and justice writing department at PEN , the literary and free expression organisation . Also Read Australia Shocker : Woman Falls Through Floor of Her Rental Home in Melbourne , Finds She Was Pregnant and Suffered Miscarriage ; Sues Landlord . Timed to the start Wednesday of Prison Banned Books Week , Reading Between the Bars draws upon public record requests , calls from PEN to prison mailrooms , dozens of accounts from inmates and PEN struggles to distribute its guide for prison writing , The Sentences That Create Us : Crafting A Writer Life in Prison , \" which came out last year . Marquis said that the most common official reasons for bans are security and sexual content , terms that can apply to a very wide range of titles . Michigan restricted list includes Leonard thriller Cuba Libre , set right before the 1898 Spanish American War , and Frederick Forsyth The Day of the Jackal , about a professional assassin attempt to murder French President Charles de Gaulle in the . Both novels were cited as a threat to the order security of institution . Also Read Israel Hamas Conflict : We Will Not Accept Displacement of Palestinians From Their Homes in Gaza , Says Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan . One of the books Day of the Jackal deals with the planned assassination of a political leader methods for engaging in such activities and the second Cuba Libre deals with an individual engaged in various criminal enterprises , a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections told The Associated in an email . As part of the updated restricted publication process , a new Literary Review Committee has been formed to review items that were previously placed on the restricted publication list , to determine if they should remain or be removed . Amy Schumer memoir The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo was flagged by Florida officials for graphic sexual content and for being a threat to the security , order , or rehabilitative objectives of the correctional system or the safety of any person . Other books to appear on banned lists : Sun Tzu The Art of War , the compilation Prison Ramen : Recipes and Stories from Behind Bars , Barrington Barber Anyone Can Draw : Create Sensational Artwork in Easy Steps \" and Robert Greene self help best seller 48 Laws of Power . It a form of control . It the ultimate form of power of manipulation , \" Greene said in a statement issued through PEN . In its report , PEN found parallels between the frequency of prison bans and book bannings in schools and libraries . In Florida , PEN has estimated that more than 40 per cent of all library bans took place in Florida in 2022 . Meanwhile , the organisation found that more than books are banned from Florida prisons the highest of any state as of early this year , with some entries dating back to the . Texas , another frequent site of library bannings , had more than prison book bans , second only to Florida . Incidents of banning are likely much higher than what PEN has compiled , according to Reading Between the Bars , because record keeping by many prisons is erratic or non existent . Kentucky and New Mexico are among more than 20 states that do not keep centralized records . \" Prison book programs have mostly tried to raise awareness locally when prisons implement new censorship restrictions for communities they serve , \" the report reads . But these programs are largely run by volunteers and struggle to keep up with the demand for books even absent censorship . The upshot is that there have been few nationwide efforts to analyze trends in carceral censorship . Marquis says that PEN places bans into two categories : content specific , in which books are banned because of what they say or allegedly say , and content neutral , in which books are restricted because they are not sent through accepted channels . In Maine , Michigan and other states , prisoners may only receive books through a select number of vendors , whether , a local bookstore or an approved publisher . In Idaho , Amazon and Barnes Noble are not among the nine approved sellers , which include Books a Million and the Women Prison Book Project . Content neutral restrictions may also apply to the packaging some federal facilities only permit white wrapping , Marquis says , and against free or used literature because the intended recipient did not receive permission from a warden or similar administrator for each specific title mailed to them before the literature arrived , according to Marquis . A spokesman for the Idaho Department of Correction told the AP in an email that restrictions on packaging had become necessary because of an increase in the amount of drug soaked mail being sent to our residents . He added that inmates can receive books and periodicals free of charge from authorised vendors and publishers . We believe our guidelines area a reasonable response to a growing problem that puts the health and safety of the people who live and work in Idaho correctional facilities at risk , he said . Reading Between the Bars follows a study released late in 2022 by the non profit Marshall Project , which found some banned prison titles , based on lists made available by 25 states . In 2019 , a PEN report explored different levels of prison bans from individuals not permitted to receive a given book to state wide restrictions and determined that restrictions were both widespread and arbitrary . With over two million Americans incarcerated , the book restriction regulations within the United States carceral system represent the largest book ban policy in the United States , the 2019 study reads in part . The reality of book banning in American prisons is systematic and comprehensive . State and federal prison authorities censor content with little oversight or public scrutiny . Often the ultimate decision maker about a person right to read is housed in the prison mailroom .

The US Dollar closed in the red last week and is facing mild selling pressure this Monday . Oil could sink lower if the Israeli ground offensive could be completely cancelled due to international pressure . Oil prices are retreating as US yields are soaring to new multi year highs with the US 10 year benchmark rate trading above , seen as the threshold where as of now , it will start to get even more difficult for US Treasury to refund and for the US economy to start facing a credit crunch . EU leaders meanwhile have issued a joint statement demand a long pause on the ground offensive in demand for more humane and humanitarian approach for the retaliation against Hamas . Little by little humanitarian help is being allowed on the field in Gaza , though several request have been issued by state departments from foreign countries , calling their citizens to evacuate the area in light of a possible massive ground offensive . Meanwhile , The US Dollar USD is facing headwinds as it looks that its months long rally has officially halted . Traders are bracing for two big data points later this week , with on Thursday the US Gross Domestic Product GDP numbers and on Friday the Fed preferred inflation gauge with the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index PCE . A contraction or pullback in the numbers could mean another leg lower in the Greenback performance . Crude Oil WTI trades at per barrel , and Brent Oil trades at per barrel at the time of writing .

Indian Oil refineries have processed more crude in September than last year . Oil refiners in India processed million tons of crude in September . Last week , Crude Oil prices rose for a second week in a row as markets continue to keep an eye on any supply disruptions in a spillover effect on the back of the Israeli ground invasion . Macquarie strategists have issued a report mentioning that there is a short term upward risk in oil price , though in the medium term oil prices are expected to head lower . China is tapping into its Crude Oil stockpiles as it looks to boost its refining production , recent data revealed . Oil Technical Analysis : US yields are opening recession debate Oil prices have had a second week of solid gains in their performance , though the rally starts to stall now . With again a delay in the possible ground invasion by Israel into Gaza , markets are starting to second guess if it will ever happen . This means a very big risk premium needs to be priced out , which could mean more downside risk in the balance for Crude prices . On the upside , the resistance level near 88 is the first level on the bulls radar . From there , the next level will be this year high at 94 . Should a substantial squeeze unfold , look for , the high of August 2022 . On the downside , traders are bracing for the entry of that region near 78 . The area should see ample support for buying . Any further drops below this level might see a firm nosedive move , which would cause Oil prices to sink below 70 . US Crude Daily Chart',\n",

              " 'Studies continue to show that vaccines do harm fertility CLAIM New England Journal of Medicine proves 80 miscarriage rate among vaccinated women ; vaccines harm men and women fertility more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE : Christiane Northrup , James Thorp , Children Health Defense , NVTV , 20 2023 DETAILS Flawed reasoning : The 80 miscarriage figure is based on flawed calculations using partial data from a preliminary study . This study actually concluded that the data showed no obvious safety concerns for pregnant women . Incorrect : There is no biological mechanism by which vaccines might cause shedding of the virus or the spike protein . Therefore , vaccines ca explain adverse events in unvaccinated people . Misleading : While vaccines have been associated with small changes in menstrual cycles , these are within the range of normal variation . No studies suggest that vaccination harms fertility . KEY TAKE AWAY Misinformation about vaccines harming fertility is a widespread myth that has damaged public trust in the vaccines . While the original vaccine clinical trials did evaluate the effects of vaccines on fertility , scientific studies and safety surveillance data later on have shown that vaccines are safe for pregnant women and do cause pregnancy or fertility problems . itself is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications , which vaccination can help prevent . FULL CLAIM : New England Journal of Medicine proves 80 miscarriage rate among vaccinated women ; Many women will never be able to get pregnant because they had that shot ; The sperm of inoculated men does not swim . The eggs of inoculated women do not grow into embryos REVIEW Claims blaming vaccines for innumerable alleged harmful effects have been a constant throughout the pandemic . One persistent claim that spread even before a vaccine was available is that the vaccines cause infertility . This narrative has contributed to vaccine hesitancy , a stance with potentially harmful consequences . On 20 September 2023 , a Facebook video featuring gynecologist Christiane Northrup revived this old claim . The video received over interactions and shares . Northrup video is a segment of a Friday Roundtable originally uploaded by the anti vaccine organization Children Health Defense CHD in June 2022 . This event revolved around a pseudo documentary that had just been released titled Infertility : A Diabolical Agenda , produced by CHD founder Robert Kennedy and directed by former physician Andrew Wakefield , also present in the roundtable . An article by the McGill Office for Science and Society referred to Wakefield film as an Anti Vaxx Sleight of Hand Propaganda . Indeed , the central argument in the film is an old depopulation conspiracy theory claiming that vaccination campaigns aimed at eliminating maternal and neonatal tetanus in Kenya are just a cover up for forcibly sterilizing women . This claim , which dates back to the , is false and has been debunked thoroughly . The film is the first instance of Wakefield spreading misinformation about vaccines . He led a now retracted study that incorrectly linked the measles , mumps , and rubella MMR vaccine to autism . The study was found to contain several critical flaws , including data fabrication and ethical violations . However , the belief that vaccines cause autism has persisted , even though many well conducted studies published later showed no such association . Apart from Northrup and Wakefield , the roundtable gathered several other personalities in the anti vaccine community , including chemical engineer Brian Hooker , pediatrician Liz Mumper , and gynecologist James Thorp . Northrup speech supposedly provided evidence that vaccines harm fertility , particularly in women . However , the data that Northrup cited does support her claim , as they do come from reliable scientific studies but from partial analyses with many critical flaws , as we will explain below . Claim 1 Flawed reasoning Raw data from a study published in the New England Journal proves that 80 of the women who get the shot in the first and second trimester , basically zero to 20 weeks , have an 80 miscarriage rate . Now the miscarriage rate just baseline is one in six This claim , which made the rounds online in July 2021 , is based on a study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC in June . In it , the authors evaluated the safety of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine in pregnant women using reports from the vaccine safety surveillance systems . Northrup was the only one who has made this claim . In August 2023 , another participant in the Friday Roundtable , Thorp , cited the same figure in a video interview with broadcast host Nicholas Veniamin . But the 80 figure that Northrup and Thorp cited is based on flawed calculations that misrepresent the results of the study , as Health Feedback showed in an earlier review . Reuters , Full Fact , , and PolitiFact , among others , also debunked the claim , pointing out the same flaws . Briefly , the CDC analyzed data from 827 pregnant women who had received a vaccine and completed pregnancy either with a positive or a negative outcome before the study was released . Then , the authors calculated the rate of negative pregnancy outcomes , including miscarriage . Among them , 104 experienced a miscarriage , a rate similar to that reported in other studies in pregnant women conducted before the pandemic . Therefore , the authors concluded that these results , although preliminary , did suggest that the vaccine posed a risk to pregnant women . However , some websites and social media posts argued that the authors should have calculated the miscarriage rate differently . Because miscarriage by definition can only occur in the first or second trimester , they asserted that all women who received the vaccine in the third trimester 700 should have been excluded from the calculation of the miscarriage rate , which would result in a miscarriage rate of 104 out of 127 . But this calculation is incorrect and overrepresents miscarriages . When interpreting the study , it important to keep in mind that the study had been published somewhere between four to six months after the women included had been vaccinated . What this means is that most women who had been vaccinated in the first or second trimester could only have completed their pregnancy by the time of the study publication if they had miscarried or had an abortion . Therefore , calculating the miscarriage rate in only women vaccinated during their first or second trimester with a completed pregnancy selects for a group in which miscarriage is the most likely outcome . And the minority who did had an induced abortion instead , as the study data showed . What would have been needed to calculate an accurate miscarriage rate was the pregnancy outcomes for all of the women vaccinated during their first and second trimester . However , the authors could obtain this information before the study was published , since many of these women pregnancies were still in progress . Multiple robust studies conducted later show that vaccines are associated with a higher risk of poor pregnancy outcomes , and do support the claim that vaccination jeopardizes pregnant women or their 8 . On the contrary , by preventing severe illness , vaccination can actually reduce the risk of negative outcomes for both the mother and the . Claim 2 Unsupported and Misleading We had a group of about women on Facebook who were talking about their experience with their menstrual cycle ; they never seen anything like it . 90 year olds beginning bleeding again . And we are not talking mild bleeding , we are talking clotting One of the central pieces of evidence in Northrup narrative that vaccines harm fertility is a project called My Cycle Story , which she conducted together with Thorp and Hooker , among others . According to the website , the project objective was to evaluate the effect of exposure to the spike protein on women reproductive health . To do that , Northrup and colleagues distributed through social media a survey with 91 questions . A total of more than women aged 18 years and above responded to the survey between 16 May 2021 and 31 December 2021 . Then , based on the data collected , they conducted several analyses . One of these analyses focused on the unvaccinated women who had had a prior SARS infection , and therefore , had no prior exposure to the spike protein . The website claimed that of these women had been in close proximity to someone who had been vaccinated and that of them reported irregular periods Within a week of contact . Northrup and colleagues concluded that proximity to vaccinated individuals increased the risk of menstrual abnormalities , suggesting a potential link between these changes and vaccines . However , this conclusion is entirely based on the idea that people who received a vaccine can pass it to others , which is incorrect . As Health Feedback explained in an earlier review , there is no biological mechanism by which vaccines could cause shedding of either the virus or the spike protein . Viral shedding is a phenomenon that can occur in live attenuated vaccines like the vaccines against chickenpox which use a live but weakened virus to induce immunity . People who receive this type of vaccine can produce and excrete vaccine derived virus that may still retain the ability to replicate in cells . While these viruses are generally innocuous in healthy people , they might cause disease in some people like those with a weakened immune system . However , none of the vaccines authorized in the and Europe use live virus . Most vaccines to date do even use the whole virus but only part of it , generally the spike protein . With regards to the mRNA vaccines specifically , they do contain the spike protein itself but rather the instructions that allow the cells to produce it . The mRNA and the spike protein have only a limited lifespan in the body and the small quantities in which they are produced have been shown to cause harm . In summary , the claim that unvaccinated women are experiencing changes in their menstrual cycles due to shedding from vaccinated people is baseless . Furthermore , the available evidence does suggest any safety concerns regarding menstrual cycles . While the original clinical trials did evaluate the effect of vaccination on menstrual cycles , several large studies since have addressed this question . In January 2022 , Edelman et al . published in Obstetrics Gynecology the first study analyzing the effects of vaccines on menstruation in nearly women aged 18 to . The study found that receiving one dose of a vaccine was associated with an increase in cycle length of less than one day compared to unvaccinated women . The authors confirmed these results in a follow up international study involving more than women and published in the British Medical Journal in August . It is important to note , however , that changes in cycle length of less than eight days are considered within the range of normal variability . Therefore , while the researchers did find a change , the small difference observed is very unlikely to have any clinical relevance . The largest study published so far was conducted by researchers in Sweden and published in the British Medical Journal in May . This study analyzed data from more than three million women and concluded that their findings do not provide any substantial support for a causal association between vaccination and healthcare contacts related to menstrual or bleeding disorders , which directly contradicts Northrup claim . Claim 3 Unsupported and Misleading 269 women reported decidual cast shedding ; It doing something to the coagulation pathways in the body . That is just the tip of the iceberg . I keep thinking when these young women realize they will never be able to get pregnant because they had that shot Again relying on the My Cycle Story survey , Northrup published a report focusing on decidual cast shedding DCS , a rare gynecological event in which the lining of the uterus endometrium sheds in one large piece during menstruation . The report was published in the Gazette of Medical Sciences in April 2022 . We could find this journal indexed in the scientific literature databases MEDLINE , PubMed Central PMC , Web of Science , and Scopus . Among all surveyed women , 292 reported having experienced DCS for the first time within the survey period , which the authors considered unprecedented compared to the baseline rate in the general population . The report also suggested that exposure to the spike protein , either through natural exposure , vaccination , or shedding of the spike protein through exosomes might be behind this and other menstrual abnormalities . Northrup and colleagues then speculated that the alleged surge in DCS cases is due to coagulation problems caused by the vaccines . But what Northrup did say is that DCS is usually a sign of a serious health problem . Although this event could be a sign of ectopic pregnancy in certain cases , especially when combined with other symptoms like sudden intense pain , this event alone generally is associated with long term medical problems or infertility , contrary to Northrup claim . Furthermore , as we explained above , vaccines do cause shedding , and therefore ca explain adverse events that occurred in unvaccinated people . In addition , the report itself stated that literature about DCS is scarce , most of it consisting of case reports that can not determine a reliable prevalence of DCS events . Karen Duncan , an obstetrician and gynecologist at NYU Langone Health , told Bustle that decidual casts are not commonly mentioned in OB GYN textbooks and are mostly described in rare case studies in scientific literature . The Cleveland Clinic also states that decidual casts are rare and the exact number is unknown . Overall , this raises questions about how Northrup determined that the rate has increased , if there is a reliable baseline estimate to compare current rates with . Finally , the report itself stated that the survey was not designed to determine the etiopathophysiology of this surge in DCS . So , even if there were an increase , the report would be unable to establish its cause . Surveys can be very prone to biases , such as bias in the way participants are selected selection bias or a tendency for participants to retrieve information that confirms their own pre existing ideas or beliefs confirmation bias . These biases need to be minimized and corrected . However , there is no indication that the authors tried to make such corrections in the report . Claim 4 Unsupported Fertility clinics have never seen anything like it . The sperm of inoculated men does not swim . The eggs of inoculated women do not grow into embryos and those that do have a huge amount of contamination with stuff that non organic Northrup made this claim without providing any supporting data , only citing Carrie Madej as the source . Madej is an osteopath who spread the false claim that vaccines contain nano technology living parasites . Health Feedback reviewed this claim in 2021 , explaining that vaccines do contain living organisms of any kind , and there is no evidence that the organisms that Madej described even exist . Likewise , the claim that vaccines impact men or women ability to conceive is supported by any credible evidence . Studies on couples trying to conceive and without fertility showed no differences in the likelihood of conception between vaccinated and unvaccinated couples . Several studies evaluated the potential impact of vaccines on sperm . One small study involving 37 men in Israel reported a temporary drop in sperm count after a second dose of the BioNTech Pfizer . The authors attributed this effect to the fever that often occurs as a side effect of vaccination , and noted that the sperm was damaged and the counts returned to normal levels after a few months . But other studies found no differences in the sperm volume , concentration , morphology and motility between vaccinated and unvaccinated 20 . In contrast , several studies have reported a decrease in sperm counts and quality following a SARS 23 . Conclusion Claims that vaccines cause fertility and pregnancy problems are unsubstantiated and contradict the available evidence . Published studies so far show that vaccines are safe for pregnant women and not associated with pregnancy complications or infertility in men or women . It is itself that increases the risk of pregnancy complications and poses a risk to both the mother and the baby . Contrary to these claims , vaccination helps reduce the risk of harm to the mother and baby . REFERENCES',\n",
              " 'AI Will and Should Change Medical School , Says Harvard Dean for Medical Education This conversation is part of a series of interviews in which JAMA Editor in Chief Kirsten Bibbins Domingo , PhD , MD , MAS , and expert guests explore issues surrounding the rapidly evolving intersection of artificial intelligence AI and medicine . How is generative AI catalyzing a paradigm shift in medical education ? What will it mean for AI to assist in medical school applications or clinical teaching ? And can AI be harnessed to elevate the skills and acumen of clinicians while also allowing them to connect more deeply with their humanity in encounters with patients ? Needless to say , when it comes to med school , it a brave new world . It the world Bernard Chang , MD , MMSc Video , has been steeped in since being named dean for medical education at Harvard Medical School this summer . JAMA Editor in Chief Kirsten Bibbins Domingo , PhD , MD , MAS , recently spoke with Chang , who is the Daniel Federman , MD , professor of neurology at Harvard and a practicing neurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston . Video . AI and Clinical Practice Can AI Accelerate Medical Education ? The following is an edited version of their conversation . Dr Bibbins Domingo : Well , it is an interesting time for medical schools . You recently wrote an editorial that accompanied what JAMA publishes every year about the demographics of the students in medical schools in the US . Your editorial focused on how AI is going to transform medical education . Dr Chang : I think this is about to be a major inflection point in medical education akin to what we experienced when the internet and internet search engines became available . The internet was around when I was in medical school in the , but it was really a source of medical information . Certainly as students , we did go to the internet to help in our courses or help to learn material . But when search engines became available , it became clear that access to knowledge was so much easier and cheaper and simpler than it had been before . And what many medical schools around that time did was evolve their curriculum from one that emphasized lectures , which of course are very efficient ways of transferring facts and knowledge , to small group discussion formats which are more beneficial toward knowledge integration and knowledge analysis and interpretation and help students with oral presentation skills . Dr Bibbins Domingo : So it not as much that we have to memorize everything and just have all of that knowledge transferred to us . It more that medical education is focused on the higher order skills of integrating that knowledge to try to make a clinical decision . Dr Chang : Exactly . And I think coming up in these next few years , we going to have a similar transformation , which is that what generative artificial intelligence , these AI tools like ChatGPT , can do very effectively is summarize and even analyze and even make probabilistic decisions for us using data that we provide to it . And so like what happened years ago , I think in undergraduate medical education we need to similarly evolve our curricula to reflect this new era . Our students of course still need to learn the fundamentals of how to be a doctor . That will never change . But we can more quickly move our students toward doing even higher levels of cognitive analysis , higher levels of understanding the individual patient nuance , which I think might still be difficult for AI to handle . Higher levels of compassionate and culturally competent communication , which we know AI might have some difficulty with . And returning students to the primacy of the physical exam , which as far as I know chatbots are not going to be replacing in the next few years . So in other words , what I point out in my Viewpoint is that we need our students to be even more human in their doctoring skills than ever before , working at the highest levels of cognitive analysis , engaging in the most personally nuanced forms of communication , and remembering the importance of the actual laying on of hands . Dr Bibbins Domingo : Let take those 3 elements together . We already know that things like ChatGPT take tests pretty well , but you are challenging us that the medical student then of the future will need to not just be building this font of knowledge but be even better at integrating and figuring out how to synthesize that knowledge for the types of clinical decisions that are being made . So they might rely on ChatGPT for a first order , but they have to be even better using their human skills at figuring out how to integrate that for the patient . ChatGPT communicates , it seems to be very good at being empathetic , but you challenging us to be more human in our communication skills that we are teaching medical students . And then the physical exam , which presumably these gen generative AI tools are not going to ever be able to do . Dr Chang : Right . So as an example , we know that ChatGPT when given a set of signs and symptoms can produce a fairly good differential diagnosis . And that something that we still need to teach our students , but maybe more quickly than before we can move our students to a level at which they working with that differential diagnosis to make it individualized to their particular patient . To take into account some of the particular nuances and specifics of their patient history or their patient lived experience that ChatGPT really ca take into account . And that where their role as medical students and future doctors can be most useful . We want to train our students to be the physicians of the future who are going to be AI enabled physicians . Artificial intelligence is not going to replace physicians , right ? But physicians who use artificial intelligence are really going to be working at the top of their game in clinical medicine . So we want to train our medical students to be those physicians , to be the physicians who in a clinical visit can really focus on that interpersonal interaction to really get to know their patients as human beings , to be that compassionate provider , and to do the most incisive levels of clinical decision making while AI is presumably running in the background and doing some of the lower level tasks that otherwise would occupied those physicians in the past . So it not that we do need to start from the basics . Of course medical students need to start from the basics , but I believe they can move more quickly from the basics to more advanced levels of reasoning and communication , knowing that they be supported by AI in the future to do the fundamentals of decision analysis and communication . Dr Bibbins Domingo : What I like about your piece so much is that it seems like this natural evolution . We used to never think we would have calculators at exams or we would never have these other types of catalogs of medical knowledge as a part of our exams . And now we routinely accept them because we want our clinicians to be functioning at much higher levels . So it resonates so much for me what you written . Now , how do we do that ? How are you going to do that at Harvard Medical School ? Dr Chang : Our students learn to take a history , they learn to perform a physical exam , and then they learn to write a proper clinical note . And then we ask them to do it over and over and over again to basically instill that into their minds and show us with confidence that they can automatically generate solid clinical notes that are interpretable by other providers . Well , we know that ChatGPT writes pretty good clinical notes if given the right inputs . So I love for our students to learn the basics of history and physical exam and writing clinical notes . But instead of spending as much time as we do now writing notes over and over and over again , we can move our students to higher levels of analysis and interpretation earlier in their medical education . Dr Bibbins Domingo : So you not talking about replacing the building blocks . You talking about moving more quickly through those to get to the point that we actually focused on still , the big gap between what we learn in medical education and what we need as a practicing physician . How do we do that ? Where do you see the changes ? Are they going to be in the first few years of medical education ? Are they going to be in the later years ? I recognize you a new dean , but do you have a sense of what type of things will look different as we go into the future ? Dr Chang : Honestly , I think every phase of medical education is going to look different and every phase of undergraduate medical education , from preclerkship curriculum to the clinical clerkships to the postclerkship phase . I think everything is going to look different . In the preclerkship curriculum , for example , in the basic science and social science courses , AI is going to be present as an educational tool . It already happening . The entering class of first year students , many of them were college seniors when ChatGPT became available last academic year , and they are now going to be using ChatGPT , , and other tools like that to help them learn , to help them preview the material in our flipped classroom environment , to help them consolidate the knowledge afterward , and to study the content for exams . So that already present . They using it as an educational tool . They can use it to serve as a self tutor because you can ask ChatGPT to serve as a tutor , to test you with certain questions , and to alter the level of difficulty of the questions based on your responses . So already that right from the beginning of medical school . In our clinical skills course where we preparing our students to be able to have the fundamental building blocks to go onto the clerkships , again , I think we going to be able to use the fact that ChatGPT is available to move our students to those higher level clinical skills earlier on . And then I think after the clerkships , as students are exploring subinternships and electives and thinking about applying to residencies , of course this is going to be 2 or 3 years from now for our entering students , and we will have 2 or 3 years of generative AI under our belts . I think it going to play a very large role in our students experience as they , as subinterns , actually lead the care of their own inpatients on teams . We already seeing that among our house officers , who after all are some of the primary teachers of our students , among our residents and fellows ChatGPT is being used to help refine a differential diagnosis to make sure that nothing is missed , to help with some of the difficult or rare conditions that we know that AI can be very helpful for and that sometimes humans have cognitive biases against . And so as our students see this being used by residents and fellows and attendings on the wards , that going to be part of their education because AI is going to be part of the future of clinical medicine . And just like any aspect of clinical medicine , as medical school leaders , we need to adapt what we teaching and how we teaching to prepare our students for clinical medicine in the future . Dr Bibbins Domingo : When these types of generative AI tools first came into prominence or awareness , educators , whatever level of education they were involved with , had to scramble because their students were using them . They were figuring out how to put up the right types of guardrails , set the right types of rules . Are there rules or danger zones right now that you thinking about ? Dr Chang : Absolutely , and I think there quite a number of these . This is a focus that we embarking on right now because as exciting as the future is and as much potential as these generative AI tools have , there are also dangers and there are also concerns that we have to address . One of them is helping our students , who like all of us are still new to this within the past year , understand the limitations of these tools . Now these tools are going to get better year after year after year , but right now they are still prone to hallucinations , or basically making up facts that are really true and yet saying them with confidence . Our students need to recognize why it is that these tools might come up with those hallucinations to try to learn how to recognize them and to basically be on guard for the fact that just because ChatGPT is giving you a very confident answer , it does mean it the right answer . And in medicine of course , that very , very important . And so that one just the accuracy and the validity of the content that comes out . As I wrote about in my Viewpoint , the way that these tools work is basically a very fancy form of autocomplete , right ? It is essentially using a probabilistic prediction of what the next word is going to be . And so there no separate validity or confirmation of the factual material , and that something that we need to make sure that our students understand . The other thing is to address the fact that these tools may inherently be structurally biased . Now , why would that be ? Well , as we know , ChatGPT and these other large language models LLMs are trained on the world internet , so to speak , right ? They trained on the noncopyrighted corpus of material that out there on the web . And to the extent that that corpus of material was generated by human beings who in their postings and their writings exhibit bias in one way or the other , whether intentionally or not , that the corpus on which these LLMs are trained . So it only makes sense that when we use these tools , these tools are going to potentially exhibit evidence of bias . And so we need our students to be very aware of that . As we have worked to reduce the effects of systematic bias in our curriculum and in our clinical sphere , we need to recognize that as we introduce this new tool , this will be another potential source of bias . You alluded to the fact that we need to help our students understand what the right use of these tools is . Is it okay to use these tools to write an assignment ? Is it okay to use these tools to help yourself study ? Is it okay to use these tools to draft that clinical note , that writeup on the patient that you just saw in your doctoring course ? Well , we need to establish a set of educational policies and so forth to make sure that our students are still learning the basics and are using these tools as aids to their education and aids to their work . You used the calculator analogy before . A student who started with a calculator right at the beginning might not ever learn basic arithmetic , but once you learned basic arithmetic , we want you to be able to go on to learn more advanced forms of mathematics by using a calculator to help you take care of the basic arithmetic more quickly and without as many errors . And that what we need to tell our students about for ChatGPT . Dr Bibbins Domingo : I like that . It does strike me that even language models that are not trained on all the world information on the internet but are just trained on health care data , the challenge is that it risks learning the patterns of bias and not optimal care that we in medicine have delivered for our patients . One of the things that I loved being part of an educational institution , and I sure I suspect the same is for you , is teaching the next generation of clinicians to imagine the world different than what we have currently created . It good , but we also want it to be better . And that part of the ambition , I think , for medical schools . And so it feels like that another thing placing these tools in context as one of the tools but not something that substitutes from imagining the world differently than what currently exists . Dr Chang : Absolutely . It seems a little bit counterintuitive to be talking about how we may be able to strengthen and return to more of that humanistic patient physician encounter in the face of a computational revolution here . But I really believe it . I love to see in the future our medical students and future physicians be able to spend more time at the bedside , more time looking at the patient , and less time typing over on the keyboard . More time concentrating on the individual nuanced communication and making sure that everything is being understood and less time worrying about whether this or the other fact is going to be recalled . And I imagining that after a clinical encounter , which is going to be more face to face time and more effective in compassionate communication , then the physician will be able to turn to the screen aided by AI and have a note drafted , have a differential diagnosis listed , have laboratory results from the online medical record that might be relevant to the conversation pulled up , maybe have letters to consultants already drafted things that might otherwise taken the physician quite a lot of time to search for in the past . And knowing that that is running in the background should give me as the physician more opportunity and more leeway to spend time talking with my patient the way I really ought to have been all along . Dr Bibbins Domingo : So as applicants to medical school become more AI savvy , what will be the impact either on the process of going to medical school or the class that you admitted ? Dr Chang : This is a question that is at the top of our minds because one of the things that I think AI can help us with is distinguishing the content with which we are judging our applicants from the fluency and readability of their language . And I think it very difficult for us to separate those two things . When a personal statement reads very well and sounds very good , we are naturally inclined to think , wow , this is somebody who expresses themselves very well and we naturally inclined to think that the content of what they said , the substance of what they said , is very valuable . And while that may be true in certain circumstances , I think it does inherently carry some bias against those for whom English was not a native language or their first language and against those for whom other forms of expression are more natural to them . I think AI will level the playing field there , and it will force us to look more closely at the substance of what people are writing , the nature of their experiences , why they actually want to become physicians , what their visions for a career in medicine are , and not just simply the surface readability or fluency of their language , because ChatGPT can make everybody sound fluent in that way . Dr Bibbins Domingo : I certainly agree with you . As in our business in the editorial and publishing world , being able to have publishing be more accessible to a range of authors because they can give us a manuscript that sounds or reads much more like what we used to reading that certainly resonates for me . But are you worried we going to get the empathy from ChatGPT and confuse it with whether that person who applying is really that wonderful , empathetic human being who might make a good doctor ? Dr Chang : It a great question , and I think that something that we going to struggle with . ChatGPT generates what I would call generically empathic statements . It very good at doing that , but we do want generically empathic doctors . We want medical students who are going to take their own experiences and learn from their patients who have their own lived experiences and generate authentic conversations and authentic communication to help with that patient health . And I think that going to be the job of our admissions committees , which is to look beyond the generically empathic statements to see the substance behind what our students , our applicants , are offering and the substance behind their internal drive to come to the field of medicine . Dr Bibbins Domingo : I have one more question for you . We have all of these wonderful applicants and entering students who have lived in this AI world and then they still being taught by the faculty . How are you going to train us faculty members to be the faculty of the future ? Dr Chang : This is a great point , and this is a major challenge for us , but it also a great opportunity . Our faculty are excited to learn . They need to learn . They are not naive to this . They need to learn , but they want to learn because they see the potential for what this can mean for the education of our students . First of all , they see , frankly , the potential that this can make their work a little bit quicker and a little bit easier in terms of generating new content , generating assessment questions , finding ways to instruct the students , and also to test the students on their knowledge . So in some ways , this is a tool that will make our faculty job easier , but what we need to do in medical school is work on faculty development . And we going to spend a lot of this next year doing that . Right now anyway , there no better way to learn how these tools work than to try them . And that been our mantra to our faculty , which is just try it , try it , try it . Using your current course materials , try it with what you doing on the clerkships right now , or what you doing in the subinternships right now , and do just rely on the first response . And so we had a couple of different messages for our faculty . Number one is that generative is the key word in generative AI . This is not just a fancy Google search . Do use it just to try to find some more obscure fact than you were going to find on Google . This generates content for you . It writes human sounding text for you . So it plays its most important role at times when you need to generate , when you need to write , when you need to create text content for the page . And that one thing we telling our faculty . Another thing we telling our faculty is the importance of what now known as prompt engineering , which is knowing what questions to ask . It funny because that an old fashioned thing we tell our students on the wards , right ? That when students say , That patient was a poor historian , perhaps , in fact , it because you did ask the right questions . And it the same thing with these generative AI tools . The quality of the prompt that you give it is proportional to the quality of the response that you going to get . And so we have to become better at generating specific prompts that we know are going to elicit the kinds of responses that we need that are going to be most helpful . And I always tell our faculty , do just stop with the first response . The first answer that you get back is just a first draft , and you would never accept a first draft as your final version . So if there something that you do like about what came back , if there was an error , or if it was not quite what you were looking for , the beauty of ChatGPT is that you can converse . You can say , Actually , that not quite what I was looking for . I was expecting X and Y and please do do Z again . And then it come back with another response . And in my experience , after just 2 or 3 iterations , you have something that much closer to what you intended than maybe the first try . So these are some of the simple mantras that we been spreading to our faculty as they learning , and we all learning how to use these tools in our educational program .

Advertisement It is not possible to forecast the impacts of HPAI across South Georgia , given that the patterns of transmission and mortality in Europe and the Americas space has been highly variable . GSGSSI and BAS will continue to work together to monitor the impact of the wildlife at Bird Island , and the potential spread to other areas , said the British Antarctic Survey . Bird flu could devastate penguins and seals in Antarctica In September , scientists expressed concerns that the outbreak could spread to Antarctica and devastate penguin and seal populations . Dr Jane Rumble , OBE , told The Telegraph at the time that It could be absolutely devastating . We saying when , not if . Advertisement Animals tend to concentrate together .

Since 2021 , Europe and the Americas have been suffering from a nearly continuous outbreak of avian influenza which has been described as \" the largest ever \" outbreak on the three continents . The virus has affected tens of millions of birds and thousands of mammals across the world . Amid the continuing global outbreak , a number of outbreaks have been reported in Israel . The first outbreak of the season was reported at a petting zoo including over 200 peacocks , geese , ducks , guinea fowls , chickens , doves , and parakeets in Sde in northern Israel . Since then , two additional cases have been reported , including an outbreak at a chicken coop containing birds at Allonim in northern Israel , not far from Sde . The second case was reported on October 10 , when a black stork was found to be infected at Ein HaMifratz between Haifa and Acre .

              " 'Stocks slide , oil holds gains on Middle East , economy concerns Asian stocks sank on Thursday , tracking a retreat on Wall Street fueled by a surge in US Treasuries and worries over a possible escalation of the Middle East crisis , which also helped oil hold the previous day rally . Disappointing corporate reports from US tech titans added to the sense of gloom among investors , while the burst of optimism that greeted China massive spending pledge this week began to fade . A warning from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that a ground invasion of Gaza was being prepared fanned a rush to safe haven assets and sent crude up more than two per cent Wednesday , with traders concerned about supplies from the crude rich region . The commodity had seen prices slip in recent days on hope Israel was recalibrating its plans as Palestinian militants Hamas continues to release hostages . The spike sent 10 year treasury yields seen as a proxy for future interest rates surging back towards , and putting pressure on the Federal Reserve as it tries to battle inflation while attempting to avoid tipping the economy into recession . Data later in the day is expected to show US gross domestic product expanded heartily in the third quarter but there is a worry that with borrowing costs at two decade highs and oil elevated , a contraction could come in the new year . That comes amid a corporate reporting season that saw Facebook parent Meta warn about the outlook next year , Google parent Alphabet post disappointing cloud figures and Texas Instruments issue bearish forecasts . The question now turns to earnings as earnings drive stock prices , said Howard Ward , chief investment officer of Growth Equities and portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds . This is where the rubber meets the road . A recession would result in higher unemployment , less consumer spending , slower gross domestic product growth and lower earnings , which implies lower stock prices . The Fed next meeting at the end of the month will be keenly followed by investors , hoping for some guidance on rates going into 2024 . A plunge in Alphabet and Texas , as well as Amazon ahead of its report later on Thursday , hit Wall Street , with the tech rich Nasdaq tanking more than .

Hong Kong and Shanghai were back in negative territory as Wednesday rally fueled by China move to pump more than 100 billion into infrastructure spending petered out . Traders are keeping close tabs on Japanese authorities as the yen sits at a one year low against the dollar , with Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki saying officials were watching currency moves with a high sense of urgency . Bets are rising on an intervention if the yen goes near the per dollar that sparked a move last year . The currency weakness comes as the Bank of Japan refuses to move away from its ultra loose monetary policy , even as the Fed warns it could hike further or keep rates high for some time . The BoJ is facing calls to tweak its yield curve control policy , which allows bond rates to move only within a certain narrow band . The yen persistent weakness also adds pressure on the BoJ policy settings , whether or not to raise the ceiling for yield curve control , remove YCC or end the negative policy rate , said Koji Fukaya , at Market Risk Advisory . However , he added that the unit would likely be kept from moving much higher by the prospect of intervention , but kept weaker by the massive difference between the Fed and BoJ rates .',\n",

The overseas brokerage firm suggested investors use any near term correction as an opportunity to add and leverage on a positive historical seasonality to general elections . The global brokerage said India offers the strongest emerging market nominal GDP compounding . Eased down US Treasury yields The yield on the 10 year US Treasury took a breather and hovered around per cent after scaling 5 per cent earlier in the week . The bond yields move inversely to the price of the debt security and equity markets . It functions as a benchmark for global borrowing costs . Rising Global Markets Global shares rose on Friday after data showed the US economy was growing robustly and traders awaited a US core inflation report later in the session that may show price pressures are continuing to abate . MSCI all country equity gauge rose per cent . The US economy expanded at its fastest rate for almost two years in the September 2023 quarter . Signs of Ceasefire Hamas signalled a tonedown in the ongoing conflict with Israel . A Hamas official tied the release of hostages held in Gaza to a ceasefire in Israel punishing air war in the enclave , launched after a deadly rampage by Hamas militants into southern Israel nearly three weeks ago . Countries across the globe are urging Israel to hold troops and delay the ground operations .

The Israel Hamas conflict continues to be a major headwind for markets . If the conflict lingers for long it has the potential to impact global growth , too , when the global economy is already in the midst of a slowdown . In the near term , however , the strongest headwind for the market is the stubbornly high US bond yields . With the 10 year bond yield at near 5 per cent FPIs are likely to be in the sell mode .

              " 'Waqar Younis , Shoaib Akhtar to Rizwan Pakistani cricketers bring religion on field , not India The fact was disregarded that Rizwan is frequently spotted praying on the cricket field , such as during a World Cup 2021 India Pakistan match in Dubai , where his team won . While it is possible that his prayers were not aimed at the Hindu majority Indian team , it worth noting that Pakistan former cricketer Waqar Younis expressed joy that Rizwan prayed in front of Hindus . Younis found it special . The global public reaction was so intense and rightly so that Vicky , as Younis is fondly known , found himself compelled to extend an apology for letting the excitement of the moment sweep him away . It seems the fervour of the match stirred emotions beyond the boundary lines , prompting a response that he later felt the need to reconcile . Pakistani fans , reeling from the defeat , decided to focus on a passionate moment when spectators on the ground greeted their wicket keeper batsman Mohammad Rizwan with Jai Shri Ram slogans . Pakistanis , Leftists and Islamists in India immediately got down to business . They targeted the entire state of Gujarat and then India for what they claimed was an outrageous religious jibe made at the poor victim , Rizwan . Sports is the only war human civilisation should actually be passionate about . However , the reality of this unjust world that we live in is different . Recently , a storm in a teacup incident was blown out of epic proportions by Pakistanis and by those who are Pakistanis by conviction but are unfortunately Indian citizens . During the ongoing World Cup , an India Pakistan match took place on 14 October at the Narendra Modi Stadium , Ahmedabad , which is the world largest cricket stadium . India comprehensively defeated Pakistan . But that just the tip of the iceberg . In that same World Cup match , a Pakistani presenter Bazid Khan , casually told Pakistan team captain Babar Azam , Kufr toot gaya , which was interpreted as idolatry being shattered by many fans . The nonchalant nature of such discussions in their country was evident as Azam responded with a smile , acknowledging that it was indeed over . But the story does end there . Consider the instances of everyday bigotry against Hindus normalised by the who who of Pakistan cricket . It disconcerting how the team , as a whole , struggles to separate their sport from religious sentiments . It almost unclear whether they playing a game or pursuing a religious mission . Take a glance at a few statements made by Pakistani cricketers : In 1978 , Mushtaq Mohammed , then captain of the Pakistan cricket team , called Pakistan test series win against India a victory of Muslims worldwide over Hindus . Former cricketer Shahid Afridi made headlines for boasting about smashing a TV upon witnessing his daughter perform the aarti . Shoaib Akhtar explained the concept of Ghazwa e Hind and said that we will first capture Kashmir and then invade India . If Muslims show their Muslim ism , not one human on earth will remain non Muslim , said former captain of Pakistan national cricket team Inzamam ul Haq . Also read : We are cricket crazy and partisan , not Nazis . Stop demonising Gujarat crowd Game and religion Upon closer examination , the animosity towards Hinduism and India among Pakistani players becomes glaring . It runs so deep that former Indian all rounder Irfan Pathan was hit by an iron nail during India tour of Pakistan . Remarkably , he chose not to harbour resentment or generalise the entire nation for the actions of a few . The inclination to intertwine religion with sports appears to be a longstanding habit . Rizwan recently dedicated of his match winning performance in Hyderabad to Gaza . It further highlights the trend . In an ideal scenario , one might expect him to dedicate his win to the war struck children of both Israel and Gaza to foster unity . Rizwan chose a side , introducing a religious and political conflict into the realm of sports . The crowd in Ahmedabad responded to this , expressing their sentiments towards Rizwan consistent politicisation of religion . In an ideal world , both Rizwan and that crowd has the right to paint the world with their thought . Either Rizwan or the crowd , should be asked to not express their respective religious feelings , or both should be allowed , and we should get on with it . Have you ever witnessed an Indian cricketer , representing the nation at the highest international level , stoop to attacking another player faith or exploiting their profession to propagate conversion ? Such a stance carries with it a dismissive tone , implicitly branding the other player faith as inferior and flawed . And it not just confined to India ; even in other international cricket teams , such as Afghanistan , this sort of behaviour is notably absent . Afghan cricketers get a warm reception from Indian cricket fans . Hence , those who argued that there is Islamophobia and hatred behind the chant Jai Shree Ram should take a look at the New Delhi cricket match between India and Afghanistan . The celebration of Afghani team Rashid Khan and the genuine love he received from Indians , as the crowd cheered for him , is a testament to how India embraces him as one of its own sons . I refrain from naming over 100 Muslim players who have played for the Indian cricket team as doing so would be a sign of disrespect for the nation . This is in stark contrast to a neighbouring State where even the rarest of rare cases , such as Hindu cricketer Danish Kaneria , face relentless targeting for their faith by their team members on a daily basis . Let maintain a balanced perspective and assess things objectively , without letting Leftists and Communists guilt trip the average Indian . Sorry Pakistan , I am not sorry .

If the conflict lingers for long it has the potential to impact global growth too , when the global economy is already in the midst of a slowdown . Oil price and Inflation : The rising tension in the Middle East has led to increased volatility in crude oil prices . Even as the oil prices have softened in the past few days after hitting the 90 per barrel mark last week , there is increased fear of it going up again because of the conflict . This may put pressure on economies which trying to curb rising inflation . In India , rising oil prices could have a negative impact on economic growth in the short term , as high inflation and low profitability in various sectors would hit disposable incomes and discretionary spending . This is a big negative for the equity market . Rising Bond Yield : The 10 year US Treasury yields surged again on Wednesday , edging closer to its 17 year high of 5 . This has increased fear that the high interest rates regime would continue . Vijayakumar said that in the near term , the strongest headwind for the market is the stubbornly high US bond yields . With the 10 year bond yield at nearly 5 , foreign portfolio investors FPIs are likely to be in the sell mode . Sectors like banking and IT which constitute the largest segments of the asset under management of FPIs are likely to be under pressure .

Owing to the six day selling spree , investors in BSE listed stocks have collectively lost Rs lakh crore as the overall market capitalisation of all BSE listed firms fell to Rs 306 lakh crore from Rs lakh crore . Today alone , investors lost around Rs 3 lakh crore . \" Investors are worried about the simmering West Asia conflict , economic uncertainty and rate hike woes , and hence maintained their bearish stance for the sixth straight session , said Shrikant Chouhan , Head of Equity Research Retail , Kotak Securities , adding that monthly expiry also contributed to the sell off in frontline stocks , such as those in banking , automobile and IT sectors . gpt 9 \" ; ; We look at details as what is causing jitters among the investors : Israel Hamas Conflict : Equity market analysts believe that if the Israel Hamas conflict grows into a bigger regional crisis in the Middle East , it may create an environment of uncertainty for the global economy as the region is the biggest producer and exporter of oil . V K Vijayakumar , Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services , said that the conflict continues to be a major headwind for markets . If the conflict lingers for long it has the potential to impact global growth too , when the global economy is already in the midst of a slowdown . Oil price and Inflation : The rising tension in the Middle East has led to increased volatility in crude oil prices . Even as the oil prices have softened in the past few days after hitting the 90 per barrel mark last week , there is increased fear of it going up again because of the conflict . This may put pressure on economies which trying to curb rising inflation . In India , rising oil prices could have a negative impact on economic growth in the short term , as high inflation and low profitability in various sectors would hit disposable incomes and discretionary spending . This is a big negative for the equity market . Rising Bond Yield : The 10 year US Treasury yields surged again on Wednesday , edging closer to its 17 year high of 5 . This has increased fear that the high interest rates regime would continue . Vijayakumar said that in the near term , the strongest headwind for the market is the stubbornly high US bond yields . With the 10 year bond yield at nearly 5 , foreign portfolio investors FPIs are likely to be in the sell mode . Sectors like banking and IT which constitute the largest segments of the asset under management of FPIs are likely to be under pressure . When bond yield rises , investors tend to transfer their exposure from riskier assets such as equities to safer avenues such as government bonds , he added . Global Markets at Turmoil : Deepak Jasani , Head of Retail Research , HDFC Securities , said that Asian stocks slid to 11 month lows and European shares dropped on Thursday , hit by a rise in US Treasury yields , a slew of weak earnings reports with an ECB meeting and the release of GDP to come later in the day . After a sharp fall in US equity on Wednesday , major global indexes , including India , were either trading or closed in red on Thursday . US benchmark 500 index fell for the fifth time in six days to close below the level while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite slumped sharply following a below par earning reported by Alphabet , the parent firm of Google . Most European markets were trading with cuts on Thursday while the South Korean and Japanese markets fell in the range of 2 3 . Muted earnings in the September quarter : Vinod Nair , Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services , said that to date , the actual domestic results are below par in comparison to the excited earnings forecasted . Similar disappointments are visible in developed economies . Downgrade in earnings and valuation is arising due to risk of further slowdown of the economy due to geopolitical and elevated interest rates . Also selling pressure intensified due to expiry led volatility influencing investors to stay cautious , \" said Nair . So far this earnings season , the IT pack has reported below par numbers while the banking and the FMCG companies have missed on certain parameters . High Valuation Concerns : , trading at a trailing 12 month TTM price to earnings P E multiple of as of October 23 , is one of the most expensive equity benchmarks in the world . Some experts also note that the current headwinds from the global cues are allowing investors to reduce their exposure to the highly expensive Indian market . Mukesh Kochar , National Head of Wealth at AUM Capital , said that the market was looking for some reason to correct as the valuation was not comfortable and finally , that correction happened . He added that the market may look reasonable in terms of the valuation if Nifty corrects 300 400 points more from here and geo political risk stablises although no one can predict the top or bottom in the short term .

              " 'Energy Market Implications of the Israel Hamas Conflict The 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel will have oil market repercussions if the conflict widens to include Hezbollah or Iran . There will likely be calls to ratchet up sanctions enforcement on Iranian oil exports , which have increased in the past 6 months . Normalization talks between Saudi Arabia and Israel could be suspended amid deepening Israel Palestinian conflict , closing off an important avenue of US Saudi cooperation . A key issue to watch in the weeks and months to come is whether disrupted oil supplies from Iran or a sustained oil price increase will alter Saudi Arabia plans to unwind its production cuts . Q : What was the immediate market impact ? A : Brent crude prices rose to nearly 89 per barrel when Asian markets opened on 9 October , before settling back a bit . Front month Brent prices had dropped the week before by some 11 from their late September peak , but oil prices have now regained some of that ground . However , the price bounce was relatively limited , suggesting that , for now , the market is not concerned about a major disruption to either supply or demand . Any conflict in the Middle East can create a geopolitical risk premium , but a more dramatic price impact may not materialize unless the conflict draws in other states and non state actors . Israel has negligible oil output but is a sizeable natural gas producer . Following the attack , the country suspended production at its offshore Tamar gas field , which supplies the domestic market as well as Jordan and Egypt . Israel energy ministry noted that , if necessary , it could declare a state of emergency that would allow the government to allocate natural gas to various consumers in the event of supply shortages . Q : What would increase the oil market impact ? A : Iran would be the vector for a broader market impact . So far , US and Israeli officials have avoided blaming Iran for direct involvement in Hamas unprecedented attacks on Israeli civilians and military installations . But , for years , Iran has supported both Hamas and Hezbollah to pressure Israel on multiple fronts as part of its axis of resistance . If evidence surfaces that Iran provided material or financial support for Hamas attacks , one obvious way to exact a toll is to ratchet up enforcement of sanctions on Iran oil exports . Between May and September of this year , Iran crude oil and condensate exports averaged some million B D , returning to levels not seen in at least 4 years . There is a widespread perception in the oil market that the United States has relaxed its sanctions enforcement on Iran as it negotiated over last month release of several political prisoners , among other issues . The uptick in Iran oil exports since May helped to offset deep production cuts by Saudi Arabia and other producers . If stronger sanctions enforcement curtails Iranian volumes in the fourth quarter of this year , anticipated supply deficits could grow even wider . Read the full story here .',\n",
              " 'Bears on the prowl : Markets log worst day in 7 months on FPI selloff India benchmarks indices fell for a sixth day on Thursday , their longest losing streak since February , as elevated US bond yields and persisting worries about the Israel Hamas war led investors to flee risky assets . The Sensex plunged 901 points , or per cent , to end the session at the lowest close since June 16 . The index dropped 247 points , or per cent , to settle at the lowest level since June 27 . Thursday session was the worst for both the indices since March 13 . The yield on the 10 year US Treasury hovered close to the 5 per cent mark , dampening the appetite for equities . Foreign portfolio investors FPIs sold domestic shares worth Rs crore on Thursday . The selling was partly offset by buying to the tune of Rs crore by domestic institutions . FPIs have pulled out nearly Rs crore from domestic equities so far this month . U R Bhat , co founder of Alphaniti Fintech , said high US bond yields meant that the bond market was expecting further tightening . If US 10 year bonds are giving 5 per cent on a risk adjusted basis , no market , including India , is giving that kind of return . And FPIs would rather take that 5 per cent , especially when they are sitting on decent returns from Indian equities , Bhat said . The current level of FPI selling can be managed with domestic flows , but if it doubles or triples , then we are in trouble , he added . The real fall in Indian equities may occur when domestic investors will also think on those lines and sell , Bhat said . In the past six trading sessions , the Nifty and the Sensex have tumbled nearly 5 per cent . The 10 year US bond yield has hardened by 13 basis points to per cent during this period . India market cap has dropped by Rs trillion to Rs 306 trillion . Fears of the Israel Hamas conflict snowballing into a regional stalemate involving Iran and other oil producing countries have also continued to rattle investors . On Thursday , an Israeli army statement said it took part in an overnight targeted raid as it prepared for a ground invasion . Any escalation of the conflict is likely to spike crude oil prices and complicate the task of central banks , which are grappling with the task of taming inflation without pushing their countries into recession .

Crude oil prices pose an additional risk to India as it imports more than three fourths of its requirement . There is no sign of easing of tensions . As long as there is no progress on de escalation , investors are likely to think of the worst . Everyone is rushing to the exit , and that is reflected in stock prices , said Bhat . The decline in US tech majors and some other multinational giants due to either reporting weaker than expected earnings or acknowledging the impact of an uncertain environment added to the overall gloom . Investors are rethinking about valuations amid rising yields . Some experts advised investors to look at quality stocks after the latest crash . Stocks that are overvalued and lack quality should be sold , while quality businesses can be accumulated at these levels . Focus on large caps and quality to navigate the current volatility in the equity markets , said Naveen Kulkarni , chief investment officer , Axis Securities PMS .

General Li Shangfu was appointed to the role during a cabinet reshuffle in March but he has not been seen publicly since giving a speech on 29 August . Gen Li , 65 , is the second senior Chinese official who has disappeared this year and his ousting comes after that of former foreign minister Qin Gang , who was dismissed in July .

A replacement for Gen Li has not been announced , leaving China without a defence minister as it prepares for the arrival of foreign officials for the Beijing Xiangshan Forum on 29 October .

              " 'How the Israel Hamas war has thrown Indian markets out of gear At a time when the world is already grappling with high interest rates and inflation , the war between Israel and Hamas is adding fuel to the fire of rising crude prices . As a result , it may put additional burden on countries like India that are susceptible to imported inflation . Market watchers believe the impact of the war on the markets is likely to be soft , but not nil . Anand Shah , Head of PMS and AIF Investments at ICICI Prudential AMC , says , The long term impact of the Israel Hamas war on Indian equity markets is likely to be muted . But , it is marginally negative in the short term , considering the country dependency on imported oil and gas . Per CMIE Economic Outlook , petroleum products accounted for nearly 30 per cent of India total import bill in ; it stood at per cent in . Shah adds that if the conflict escalates and energy prices remain high , it could keep inflation high , leading to increased interest rates for longer . Elevated inflation for longer can potentially depress equity market valuations globally . Domestically , the benchmark BSE Sensex declined per cent , or 366 points , to close at on October 19 , 2023 from on October 6 . Meanwhile , crude oil prices climbed over 9 per cent to per barrel between October 6 and 19 . Sunny Agrawal , Head of the Fundamental Research Desk at SBI Securities , believes central bankers globally who are struggling to contain high inflation , and the narrative of high crude prices stoke inflation , and engender higher for longer interest made investors nervous about their next move . Agrawal says that for India that imports around 80 per cent of its crude requirements any spike in crude prices above 95 per barrel may put pressure on oil marketing companies . High crude prices also stoke inflationary pressure on sectors like cement , paints , airlines , chemicals , he says , adding that the ongoing conflicts also have the potential to push defence budgets across the world . Domestic defence firms are likely to be the key beneficiaries , he says . There are also fears that the recent hostilities may impact various sectors , including railways , ports , oil and gas , and aviation in the medium term if the situation persists . For instance , the planned implementation of the India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor IMEEC by sea and rail route might face delays , and impact domestic firms too . Several domestic railway players were supposed to bag a large chunk of orders for the creation of the mammoth rail infrastructure . Significant delay in the implementation of the project could potentially hamper the earnings growth prospects for railway players in the medium term , says Agrawal .',\n",

The US economy clearly is not in a recession , but investors worry that robust growth could continue to push prices higher , leading the Federal Reserve to keep rates high for a long time to curb inflation . Higher interest rates could mean eventual weakness for the economy and corporate profits . And high bond yields make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks and other investments . Treasury yields have spurted higher as they catch up with the main interest rate controlled by the Fed , which is at its highest level since 2001 . In the near term , traders overwhelmingly expect the Federal Reserve to hold rates steady at its next meeting , which ends Wednesday . That would mark a second straight meeting where the Fed did not hike its main interest rate , which it has pulled above per cent from nearly zero early last year .

              " 'Mediterranean diet can blast belly fat caused by aging , new study finds The Mediterranean diet could be the key to blasting belly fat . A new study from the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea Plus PREDIMED Plus revealed that the Mediterranean diet , partnered with physical activity , can counter aging related body changes suchh as fat gain and loss of muscle mass . Advertisement The study , published in JAMA Network Open on 18 , was designed to determine whether the diet could prevent cardiovascular disease but in the meantime , a subgroup was evaluated to measure the impact on body composition after a three year period . The results showed that an energy reduced lower calorie Mediterranean diet and increased physical activity appeared to reduce aging related weight gain and muscle loss . A total of middle aged and older participants , who were either overweight or had obesity and metabolic syndrome , were separated into two groups . The first group followed a Mediterranean diet while reducing their calorie intake by 30 and increasing their physical activity . Advertisement The second group followed a Mediterranean diet without calorie restrictions or changes in physical activity . The participants in the first group experienced clinically meaningful changes in body composition throughout the three year experiment , according to the researchers . 5 The study revealed that an energy reduced Mediterranean diet and increased physical activity can reduce fat gained with aging . TATIANA This included a 5 or greater improvement in fat mass , visceral belly fat mass and loss of lean muscle mass after only one year of following the diet . Advertisement Fox News Digital reached out to the researchers for comment . Nutritionist and registered dietitian Ilana Muhlstein , who was not involved in the study , told Fox News Digital that the Mediterranean diet has been touted for many years as the healthiest diet in the world . She added , And while that may be true , it is extremely arbitrary advice for a health professional to give to an average person . 5 The study author explained that people in Mediterranean countries incorporate vegetables into every meal . fascinadora Advertisement The diet encompasses a broad array of advice beyond just emphasizing whole foods , Muhlstein said . The great aspects of the diet include beans , legumes , whole grains , healthy fats , seeds , nuts and fish centered entrées , the nutritionist said . An energy reduced Mediterranean diet differs from the original by incorporating more protein , having less added sugars and containing higher volumes of fresh vegetables or fruit instead of dried fruit . Yet the healthiest part of the Mediterranean diet that so many Americans overlook is the absolute obsession with veggies and fresh herbs , Muhlstein said . 5 Foods with high levels of fats include salmon , sardines , avocado , extra virgin olive oil , and various nuts and seeds . EdNurg These high volume , nutrient dense , low calorie ingredients are the heart and soul of the true Mediterranean diet that sadly get dismissed . Countries that have a much better cardiovascular health status compared to America , like Israel or Greece , have an abundance of vegetables present at every meal , according to the dietitian . These countries do just eat vegetables they celebrate them and would never think to have a meal without them , she said . Advertisement 5 Participants saw a 5 or greater improvement in fat mass , visceral belly fat mass and total lean mass after only one year of following the diet . sonyakamoz When they serve dips , like hummus , and tzatziki , they are always accompanied by a tray of sliced cucumbers or a mixed salad . She added , However , in the United States , I see people devour high calorie Mediterranean delicacies , like pita , shawarma and falafel , with almost no veggies in sight , which misses the point . Muhlstein said people in these other countries tend to live healthier since they easily maintain a healthy body weight by filling up on lots of low starch veggies every single day . Advertisement 5 The Mediterranean diet , partnered with physical activity , can counter aging related body changes suchh as fat gain and loss of muscle mass . She encouraged Americans to limit the pita bread and fill half of their plates with Mediterranean diet staples like roasted eggplants , pickled turnips and chopped salads . As far as physical activity is concerned , Muhlstein recommended about 45 minutes of exercise six days a week to align with the naturally active lifestyles of people living in the Mediterranean . Participants in the study were contacted by trained dietitians three times a month throughout the study , which Muhlstein said most likely led to significantly improving their relationship with food . Advertisement Sadly , in America , our view of food has become really unhealthy , she said . We been encouraged to seek carbs and sugar for emotional comfort , and only turn to vegetables if we have to go on a diet . She noted , This is a type of unhealthy mindset that can result in poor health and obesity Giving the participants an opportunity to meet with a dietitian and to regularly and steadily improve their eating behaviors and relationships with food is key for creating results that last .',\n",

              " 'Oil Price Rally Reverses Despite Tightening Market Fundamentals The oil price rally has failed to gain any kind of momentum three weeks after tensions in the Middle East escalated despite market fundamentals strengthening . Brent crude for December delivery was down to trade at per barrel at 1400 hrs ET in Thursday intraday session while the December WTI contract fell by a similar margin to change hands at per barrel . Brent has now declined over the past week while WTI is down over the timeframe as worries about the global economy and energy demand weighed on sentiment . Oil prices have been a rollercoaster over the past couple of months as negative catalysts frequently outshine the positive ones and vice versa . In recent times , fears of a spillover in the conflict between Israel and Hamas , which could embroil Iran and its allies in the region , have offered considerable support to oil prices . However , the and other countries have been urging Israel to delay a full invasion of Gaza , which the Middle East nation has so far complied with . Meanwhile , global oil supply has continued tightening despite record production by shale . The latest Energy Information Administration EIA weekly data was highly bullish with crude oil inventories falling mb to mb , taking the deficit below the five year average to mb . Crude oil inventories in the WTI pricing hub at Cushing , Oklahoma , fell mb to a nine year low of mb . Meanwhile , gasoline inventories fell mb to mb , thereby cutting the surplus above the five year average to just mb . Implied demand improved significantly w w , with total demand climbing mb d to mb d and gasoline demand rising 362 kb d to mb Gasoline demand for October to date stands at mb d , a mere Y Y contraction and good for a sharp improvement from the decline Recorded in September . Gasoline demand is higher in the year to date . Related : Warren Buffet Snaps Up More Occidental Petroleum Even better , commodity analysts are predicting that oil markets will continue to tighten for the rest of the year . Commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have predicted a further 120 mb reduction in global inventories in , on top of the 172 mb reduction in . The experts expect the rate of inventory draw to accelerate from mb d in October to mb d in November and mb d in December . StanChart says it possible that the current dominance of Middle East headline trading has led to lower prices by distracting the market from both falling inventories and from producer policies aimed at achieving a soft landing for the market at higher price levels . In other words , the recent tendency towards higher prices with lower volatility has been replaced by a downwards drift with higher volatility . That a remarkable trend considering surging production . Data by the Energy Information Administration EIA shows that crude production grew to million barrels per day bpd in July , its highest since November 2019 , when production hit a peak of 13 million bpd . Texas production grew to million bpd in July , its highest on record ; North Dakota output increased to million bpd while production from New Mexico climbed to million bpd . The demand side of the equation is equally encouraging . According toStanChart , global oil demand has already exceeded the pre Covid oil demand set in August 2019 , averaging million barrels per day mb d , good for a m m increase of mb d and a y y increase of mb The analysts have refuted arguments by some Wall Street analysts that high oil prices have already triggered demand destruction . Underpricing Middle East Risk Last week , Standard Chartered pointed to a medium term reduction in Iranian oil exports as being the most likely consequence of shifts in the geopolitical landscape . It not a far fetched notion either : last week , the Biden administration slapped new tariffs on Iran due to its ballistic missile and drone programs . Back in August , we reported that Iran oil exports had hit record highs thanks in large part to the Biden administration opting to look the other way as Tehran boosts production ostensibly in a bid to keep markets well supplied and oil prices low . The price response to the escalation in the Middle East tensions has so far been modest ; however , the Israel Gaza war is likely to cause a significant shift in policy on Iran due to its open support and backing for Hamas . Constraints on Iranian oil exports were eased after the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA in 2015 but tightened again after the withdrew from the JCPOA during the Trump administration , with output falling below 2 mb d in 2020 when waivers given to consuming countries were withdrawn . Iran oil output and exports have increased sharply under the Biden administration , with production hitting 3 mb d , including b d in the current year , while exports sit just under 2 mb StanChart says that changes in positioning in the oil futures markets have been modest despite a significant increase in volatility . The analysts note that it is not an extreme tail of the distribution as might be expected in a full blown Middle East crisis , adding that speculative positioning is also not extreme , particularly in Brent . The latest fund manager data shows that prices are about USD 6 per barrel bbl lower than in late September , despite no significant loosening in fundamentals . StanChart says that the Middle East geopolitical risk is currently being significantly under priced and that current fundamentals alone are enough to justify a complete reversal of this month price undershooting .

              " 'AI Poised to Make Huge Impact in Healthcare Mergers Acquisitions The FTC has been conducting its own review of the merger , which would combine the two biggest traditional supermarket chains in the The FTC continues to pursue legal action in its own administrative hearing . A super cycle of cyber attacks and responses due to artificial intelligence will spawn a flurry of deals in the future . Administrative applications are getting a lot more attention now , says VSS Principal Eric Kim . The clinical side is longer term . Even for the near term administrative side , though , AI strictly speaking is still in its infancy and it premature to speak of activity , adds Kim , a former Optum managing director . There is a lot of funding activity , he says , to develop AI so that it can start supporting healthcare activities and increase value for PE investors . Rackspace Technology , a cloud computing company , has a portfolio of companies working on AI applications . For Nand Sharma , a vice president who helps healthcare companies in their digital challenges , the most immediate application for the technology is to make the ecosystem providers , payers , patients more efficient in everything from scheduling appointments to paying bills . Right now , you can wait for months to get an appointment , Sharma notes . AI technology will enable patients to navigate the system more efficiently , managing a patient profile and assembling historical data quickly . This will mean savings not only in dollar terms , but in time . Longer term , AI can support clinical diagnosis , starting perhaps by helping analyze imaging like MRIs , Kim suggests . However , it will take longer both for doctors and patients to become comfortable with a greater role for AI in diagnosis . There often been a black box nature to diagnosis , he says . Datasets will have to become larger and clearer , and there will have a lot of explaining involved . Doctors hesitancy in adopting is understandable . It more high stakes , and that is appropriate . Rackspace Technology Sharma sees long term potential . Tomorrow , providers will be able to provide surgeries over long distance , he says . Simple diagnoses can be done without doctors . He also calls attention to the scope for AI to help with post merger integration , an important factor in growing value once new technologies have been acquired . In any case , the industry is seizing on the new technology for the possibilities it opens up . Healthcare as a sector is largely exempt from economic ups and downs . NEXT WEEK : Everything , Everywhere , All AI At Once People are always getting sick , people are always getting older , says Adam Birnbaum , executive director and dealmaker at GP Bullhound , an investment banking boutique . Healthcare is not subject to the vagaries of the broader economy . The healthcare sector accounts for roughly a fifth of GDP , Birnbaum says . Across the board , investment continues strong , he says . Because it is often literally a matter of life and death , healthcare gets more government scrutiny . The Federal Trade Commission has made a point of examining hospital mergers , in particular , for geographical concentration that could limit patient accessibility . And because healthcare is so personal , it has numerous rules regarding privacy . Birnbaum sees potential for AI applications in the pharmaceutical industry , as the technology can sift through mountains of potential treatments to identify the most promising ones , and then help identify and locate potential participants in clinical trials . Drug companies that are looking for one in a thousand molecules to develop into Phase I trials will have help . Using AI , they can be smarter about datasets , he says . The average cost of commercializing a drug has risen to billion as costs have doubled , Birnbaum says , and anything that can help reduce that cost would make it more accessible to patients . This veteran thinks artificial intelligence is something of a misnomer to describe how the technology can improve systems and processes . Generative AI will be able to identify new applications for existing drugs , revamp existing supply chains , and locate availability of needed treatments , among other functions , he says . In the meantime , Birnbaum expects to see enormous savings in efficiency gains in back office and billing applications . The current rate of errors in payments alone contributes to exorbitant medical expenses , he says . Payers have a simple principle , Sharma notes the maximum amount of result for the minimum amount of payment . As Kim adds , AI has a role in helping payers better manage costs . Managing data will become more effective , says Sharma , as it gets cleaned up through AI . New technologies will go deeper to identify targets and patients for clinical trials and make them safer . We want to have clinical trials , but we want them to be safe , he says . A more data driven approach will also lead to more accountability , he feels . For now , it is the tech giants that are propelling AI uses in healthcare . Microsoft and its speech recognition subsidiary , Nuance Communications , have partnered with Epic to use generative AI tools for medical note taking , freeing physicians from the onerous task of transcribing clinical notes . Amazon has introduced its AWS HealthScribe for a similar purpose . See all of our coverage on artificial intelligence in PE investors in the lower middle market nonetheless are looking for promising firms to add to their portfolios and increase valuations over a five to seven year period . I do see it being that different , says VSS Kim of investing in healthcare technology . We are looking for technology and tech enabled services in line with the VSS philosophy of providing flexible growth capital . The goal , Kim explains , is often to get companies to the stage where big companies want to acquire them . AI is at such an early stage , that PE firms may wait to invest in them . Estimates of the compound annual growth rate for AI in healthcare by the end of the decade sometimes reach 40 percent or more . The role of PEs , in short , remains the same . Private equity helps companies become more advanced so they will sell at a higher value , says Sharma . There a huge play on the AI side . Some investments have already been made . Medical device maker Medtronic last year announced a 75 million investment in CathWorks , a privately held Israeli company innovating in diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease . Medtronic will begin immediately co promoting CathWorks FFRangio System , which uses AI in the , Europe and Japan . In a separate agreement , Medtronic has an option to acquire the Israeli firm for 585 million through if certain milestones are met . On the PE side , Blackford Capital in June announced its acquisition of PACIV , an industrial technology firm serving manufacturers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical sectors . Blackford plans to use PACIV as a platform for further investments as the technology firm uses an emergent form of artificial intelligence to streamline operations . Sharma company in June launched Foundry for Generative AI by Rackspace to accelerate adoption of the technology across industries . It draws on existing platforms like AWS , Google Cloud , and Microsoft Azure and applies their data to address specific uses . Says Sharma , The sky the limit for the technology .',\n",
              " 'Israel urges evacuation of Gaza hospital , five schools ; Hamas releases two US hostages Gaza Strip : Israel warned humanitarian groups in the Gaza Strip on Friday to evacuate a major hospital and five schools ahead of a potential strike , aid agencies said . The Al Quds Hospital is in northern Gaza , which has borne the brunt of Israeli air raids since Hamas staged their biggest ever attacks on Israel on October 7 . The Palestine Red Crescent launched an \" urgent appeal \" saying it had \" received a threat from the occupying authorities to bombard Al Quds Hospital \" . The Israeli warning \" demanded \" the hospital evacuation , which would affect more than 400 patients and displaced people who have sought \" safe haven \" , the group said . \" We call upon the international community to take immediate and urgent action to prevent another massacre similar to what occurred at Al Ahli Baptist Hospital , \" the statement added . A rocket attack on the Al Ahli hospital killed hundreds of people , Gaza Hamas authorities said . Hamas blamed Israeli jets , while Israel blamed misdirected fire by militants inside Gaza . The UN agency for Palestinian refugees , UNRWA , said in parallel that Israel had told it to evacuate five schools \" as fast as possible \" . All of the schools are in Gaza City , close to the hospital . \" We did what we could to protest and reject this decision , but this means that from now these facilities are no longer safe , \" said an UNRWA statement , calling on thousands of people in and around the hospitals to flee . The Red Crescent said last Saturday that it had received a similar evacuation order for Al Quds Hospital . Palestinian media said a rocket attack hit near the hospital on Wednesday . Meanwhile , Hamas rulers released two Americans on Friday among some 200 hostages they abducted in brutal October 7 attacks in Israel and indicated that more could follow . Judith Tai Raanan and her daughter Natalie Shoshana Raanan were back in Israel late Friday , the Israeli government said . No details were given on their condition , but US President Joe Biden said he was \" overjoyed \" at the news . Biden spoke by phone to the two women after they were freed . And Hamas said it was working with Qatar and Egypt to free its \" civilian \" hostages , in a sign that more releases could follow .',\n",
              " 'The Real Gaza Hospital Crisis The media firestorm over whether Israel attacked the al Ahli hospital in Gaza is over . It was an errant rocket shot by the Iran backed Islamic Jihad group that exploded near the compound . But another media firestorm is brewing , and it will focus squarely on the Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City . Al Shifa is the largest hospital in Gaza . It is also , according to numerous and credible reports , a Hamas base of military operations . The specifics have been revealed in a steady drip of open source information dating back to 2006 , when a PBS documentary showed Hamas fighters roaming Shifa halls , intimidating staff , and denying access to parts of the hospital . The following year , according to Human Rights Watch , Hamas fired at its rival group Fatah from within the Shifa hospital compound during a Palestinian civil war . As one doctor said , the medical staff are suffering from fear and terror , particularly of the Hamas fighters , who are in every corner of the hospital . In 2008 , the year that marked the first rocket war between Hamas and Israel , the New York Times noted that Hamas was operating openly within the hospital , and that members of the group murdered a patient there . One Times report stated that the Hamas leadership was located in a bunker under the hospital burn ward , while the group fired rockets from areas near the hospital , in an effort to deter an Israeli response . The following year , the Times cited Yuval Diskin , the former head of Israel internal security services Shin Bet , who said Hamas leadership was holed up in a bunker below building number 2 of Shifa Hospital . Avi Dichter , another former head of the Shin Bet , stated in 2009 that Hamas operations in Shifa was an open secret . It was such an open secret that Hamas operative Rami Misbah Abed Rabbo admitted himself that Hamas took over a large bunker under Shifa during the war with Israel in 2008 . During the 2014 war between Hamas and Israel , multiple credible media outlets reported on the Hamas operations in the Gaza hospital . The Washington Post reported that Shifa was a de facto headquarters for Hamas . Wall Street Journal reporter Nick Casey tweeted an image of a Hamas spokesman giving an interview at a Gaza hospital , saying , You have to wonder how patients at Shifa hospital feel as Hamas uses it as a safe place to see media . The tweet was later deleted . Similarly , Palestinian journalist Radjaa Abou Dagga wrote about how Hamas used Shifa for military purposes , but then sought to remove the article , fearing for his family safety . An open source intelligence report also published in Israel that year cited Palestinian sources who noted that Hamas used Shifa x ray department as a jail and interrogation facility . An Amnesty International report the following year cited evidence of Hamas torturing and killing prisoners in Shifa . In the course of my own research on Hamas over the last 10 years , multiple Israeli officials across multiple government agencies have confirmed the existence of a Hamas command center below the Shifa hospital . The group is believed to have constructed significant infrastructure well beneath the ground . This includes an operations room that effectively serves as the eyes and ears of Hamas across the Gaza Strip , with direct and secure lines to the Iranian regime , Hezbollah , other state patrons , and nonstate partners . Since the Hamas attack of October 7 , Israel has warned that it plans to destroy all Hamas infrastructure in the Gaza Strip . In private conversations with former Israeli officials , I have heard Shifa mentioned multiple times . Nobody has stated that Israel is preparing to destroy the command center . But the implication is not hard to miss . A ground invasion might lead to Israeli forces working to clear the compound , floor by floor , room by room . However , such a battle would put Israeli forces at a disadvantage . If given a choice , Israel would almost certainly elect to destroy the command center by air . This would , of course , mean additional misery for the beleaguered people of Gaza . There is a legal term for what Hamas is doing . It is using the medical staff and patients as human shields to protect Hamas terrorists from lawful attack . Doing so is a war crime , prohibited by the international law of armed conflict . The United Nations and governments worldwide have condemned the use of human shields . However , none of these actors have come forth yet to condemn Hamas for using al Shifa as a military headquarters . The coming battle over Shifa promises to be intense . The Israeli , American , and other governments should reveal what is known about the Hamas presence there right now . Hamas must be pressured to vacate if tragedy is to be averted . Of course , this is easier said than done . Hamas is defiant as Israel prepares for a ground invasion now . Still , the coming standoff need not lead to the destruction of the Shifa hospital . Rather , Israel should continue to clear the northern Gaza Strip and even bombard the entire area surrounding Shifa once civilians have been evacuated . When it is safe for Israeli forces to enter , they should surround the hospital and demand that unconditional surrender of the Hamas leadership still holed up inside . This is a drama that should play out in front of the entire world . Should Hamas refuse to surrender after a period of days or even weeks , Israel should carefully enter the compound . The first goal must be to defend the lives of all patients and doctors inside . But , when all is said and done , Israel must emerge from this compound with photos , videos , captured weapons , and other evidence of Hamas military activities that took place under the hospital . Many critics of Israel have questioned whether a ground invasion could end Hamas . It a fair question . There may not be a military solution on its own . But military operations supplemented with damning evidence that Hamas has held the Gaza Strip hostage could prove to be a dramatic moment that swings world opinion against the Iran backed terrorist organization , once and for all .',\n",

JERUSALEM The humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip , where Israel has been carrying out heavy airstrikes , is worsening . At Nasser Hospital in southern Khan Younis , patients continue to arrive . A shortage of medicine and medical equipment has the facility on the brink of collapse . Mohammed Qandeel , head of the emergency ward , warned Monday that the hospital will soon become a giant morgue . Since Gaza main power station stopped being able to supply electricity , the hospital only has enough power for a few more days . The hospital generator is its only source of power now . If the power goes out , the intensive care unit ca function . Dozens of patients on life support and babies in incubators could die . More than 250 people wounded in airstrikes are brought to the hospital every day . After triage , the emergency room doctors are forced to make gut wrenching decisions amid the circumstances . Qandeel , 35 , expressed his frustration , saying that doctors are supposed to save lives , but at the moment they have to let some patients die slowly if they think they can not save them . It a tremendous psychological burden on the doctors , he said . Babies at risk as Gaza hospital runs low on power Many children are among the patients who have been rushed to Nasser Hospital . The dearth of fuel supplies means the ambulances that normally take patients to the hospital have been replaced by carts pulled by donkeys . Small children struck by an explosion are more likely to suffer complex wounds and face life threatening conditions , said Mohammed Tayyem , a 37 year old pediatrician at the hospital . Many of the children at the hospital lost their families in airstrikes and have no relatives to care for them . Treating children becomes harder when they are psychologically unstable , Tayyem said . Eight babies are currently receiving medication and other treatment in incubators at the hospital neonatal unit . These incubators are powered by electricity , but they will stop operating if the hospital generators run out of fuel . Can you imagine that even babies could die because our hospital has no electricity ? said Doaa El Najjar , a 30 year old nurse . That would be a human tragedy . The hospital originally had 240 beds . Some beds are now being shared by patients , and conference rooms and verandas also have been transformed into wards . About 500 people are currently being treated at the hospital . Patients whose wounds are not serious are administered basic treatment and moved on . This hospital had a shortage of medical supplies even before the latest conflict erupted . But since Israel launched its bombardment of Gaza after militants from the Palestinian Islamist organization Hamas suddenly stormed into southern Israel on 7 , supplies of daily necessities such as water and food have been unable to enter Gaza . Our medical supply storage rooms are empty , Qandeel said . We told the World Health Organization and the Red Cross what we need , but nothing has reached us . We losing hope . Reuters A man reacts as Palestinians gather to search for casualties at the site of an Israeli strike on a house in Khan Yunis , in the southern Gaza Strip , on Tuesday . The doctors and nurses return home only to get a few hours of sleep , leaving many of them utterly exhausted . Ten of the emergency department 30 doctors have reportedly left due to illness and other reasons . Buildings near the hospital also have been hit by airstrikes , and many hospital workers have lost family members in the Israeli bombardment . Several thousand people who fled from northern Gaza are taking shelter in the hospital lobby and under its eaves . Infectious diseases are spreading among these evacuees and even to the hospital patients and medical workers .

The attack on Israel by the militant organization Hamas and the ensuing Israel military operations have raised fears of a wider Mideast conflict . So far oil price rises have been relatively moderate . International benchmark Brent crude traded at per barrel Tuesday , up from around 84 on the eve of the Hamas attack .

Birol pointed out that there was \" a major government response \" to the energy supply concerns that arose 50 years ago from the Arab oil embargo imposed during the 1973 Yom Kippur war . It sent oil prices nearly 300 higher and led to the founding of the IEA in 1974 to help shape a collective response to the disruption .

Concerted international action at the upcoming United Nations climate conference is needed to expand use of clean technologies and find new ways of financing the massive investment that is needed , especially in the developing world , the IEA said . The report also pointed to a shifting role for China , once a leading source of increased demand for energy due to rapid industrialization and growth . The report said energy demand there could peak as soon as 2025 amid slowing growth and \" impressive \" shifts to clean energy like solar and nuclear . The IEA estimates that demand for fossil fuels will peak before 2030 under current policies but says governments will have to increase their efforts to speed up the transition if the world is to meet the global goal of keeping warming below degrees Celsius degrees Fahrenheit .',\n",
              " 'Giannis Antetokounmpo indicates on social media that he agreed to contract extension with Bucks Giannis Antetokounmpo has indicated on social media that he has agreed to a contract extension with the Milwaukee Bucks . Antetokounmpo issued a social media post on Monday that said , \" MILWAUKEEEEEEEEE ! ! Let get it ! ! ! ! BucksInSix Extended . \" The post came as ESPN reported that the two time MVP had agreed on a three year extension worth 186 million , with a player option for the 2027 28 season . The Bucks did make an official announcement , but they reposted Antetokounmpo post on X , the social media site formerly known as Twitter . The Bucks repost , which was later deleted , included the message , \" The best possible cure for the Mondays . \" Antetokounmpo announcement came as Minnesota Jaden McDaniels , Washington Deni Avdija and Orlando Cole Anthony led the first wave of fourth year players to reach agreements on contract extensions ahead of the NBA deadline . Antetokounmpo had said this summer that he did plan to sign an extension this year because it would make more financial sense for him to wait until the summer . The two time MVP also had indicated that he wanted to wait to see how committed the Bucks were toward winning another title before he decided on whether to sign an extension on his contract , which at the time ran through 2024 25 with a player option for 2025 26 . Since then , the Bucks made a blockbuster trade to acquire seven time all NBA guard Damian Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers . Even after that trade , Antetokounmpo had indicated he did expect to sign an extension this year . I said that it did not make sense to sign the contract right now because money not important a lot of money is important . So I going to sign it next year , Antetokounmpo said with a laugh during the Bucks Media Day event on 2 . But , no , at the end of the day , again , it does make sense . It does not make sense for me to sign it right now . I got to always look at what best for me and my family , for my situation . But at the end of the day , I want to be a Milwaukee Buck for the rest of my career , as long as we are winning . It as simple as that . The extension starts with the 2025 26 season , meaning Antetokounmpo is under contract for at least four more years and a fifth if he so inclined . He will earn about million over the next two seasons , then about 120 million more for the 2025 26 and 2026 27 seasons . The last year is at his option , meaning he could make roughly 66 million more in 2027 28 . And if Antetokounmpo had waited until next summer to agree to an extension , he possibly may have secured earned even more money . A max extension scenario had he waited until 2024 could have been a four year agreement at a figure exceeding 250 million . As far as the extensions involving fourth year players , agent Bill Duffy confirmed that McDaniels and the Timberwolves agreed on a five year , 136 million extension . The overall pick in 2020 , who came to Minnesota in the same draft as star Anthony Edwards , had a breakout third season with an average of points per game on shooting . With three maximum contract players on the roster in Edwards , Karl Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert , the Timberwolves have committed themselves to the luxury tax range with their salary cap . But the 6 McDaniels is the team best defender and one of the league best shutdown wings , and the Timberwolves believe he has untapped offensive potential to pair with his defensive ability . I feel like , shoot , I can go out and score 25 points every night if I wanted to , McDaniels said at the beginning of training camp . The Timberwolves open their season at Toronto on Wednesday . McDaniels currently has a calf injury , putting his status for the game in doubt . Avdija agreed to a four year , 55 million extension with the Wizards , a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press . The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team had announced the agreement . The 22 year old Avdija started a career high 40 games last season and averaged points and rebounds . Washington drafted him in the first round in 2020 . Avdija is somewhat remarkably the longest tenured player on the Wizards . They traded Bradley Beal to Phoenix in the offseason and enter 2023 24 with a significantly different roster . Avdija , a 6 forward from Israel , has averaged points in 212 career games since the Wizards made him the ninth overall pick in the 2020 draft . Anthony and the Magic agreed to a three year , 39 million extension , which the team announced Monday . The son of 11 year NBA veteran Greg Anthony , he was the overall pick in the 2020 draft . The point guard missed more than a month last season with an oblique muscle injury and saw his scoring average drop by more than three points per game . After starting all 65 games he played in during the 2021 22 season with Markelle Fultz sidelined by injury , Anthony returned to a role off the bench once Fultz was back in the starting lineup . But Anthony shot a career best from the field , including from 3 point range , and reduced his turnovers by an average of more than one per game . Elsewhere , the San Antonio Spurs announced a multiyear extension for center Zach Collins . The overall pick in the 2017 draft averaged a career high points per game last season . Also , the Atlanta Hawks signed forward center Onyeka Okongwu to a four year , 62 million rookie contract extension . Okongwu has started in 28 of 178 career games , averaging points and rebounds . He could play a larger role this season , following the trade of power forward John Collins to Utah . The deal with Okongwu came after the team exercised the fourth year contract option on forward Jalen Johnson and the third year option on guard AJ Griffin . The Dallas Mavericks and Josh Green agreed on a 41 million , three year contract extension coming off the most productive of the guard three seasons . News of the deal comes two days before the Mavericks open the regular season in San Antonio , with Green set to see how he fits with a retooled roster around stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving . A first round draft pick in 2020 , Green has provided energy and athleticism off the bench , with more of an impact in 2022 23 than the Australian first two seasons . Green , who turns 23 next month , missed 20 games with a right elbow sprain last season but still started a career high 21 games while averaging points and rebounds .

              " 'Hasan Minhaj Calls New Yorker Article About His Fabrications Needlessly Misleading : I Not a Psycho Over a month after the New Yorker profile on him , Hasan Minhaj has responded to the piece in which he admitted to fabricating parts of his stand up act . His response comes in the form of a 20 minute video that contains recordings from the original New Yorker profile . To everyone who read that article , Minhaj said in the video , which you can watch above , I want to answer the biggest question that probably on your mind : Is Hasan Minhaj secretly a psycho ? I not a psycho . But this New Yorker article definitely made me look like one , the comedian continued . It was so needlessly misleading , not just about my stand up , but also about me as a person . The truth is , racism , FBI surveillance and the threats to my family happened . And I said this on the record . The comedian also explained why he took a beat before responding to the article that came out on 15 , saying that like you , I been paralyzed by the news coming out of the Middle East . I have been processing all the criticism that come my way . Hamas attack on Israel happened 7 . Minhaj then proceeded to do what he calls the most Hasan Minhaj thing ever and launched into a deep dive into his own scandal complete with graphics . Specifically , he focused on three exaggerated stories that were highlighted in the New Yorker article : being rejected by his prom date due to his race , getting slammed on a car by an undercover informant who infiltrated Minhaj community mosque and the anthrax scare he had in his home that allegedly led to his daughter going to the hospital . Once again , Minhaj admitted that the latter two and far more serious stories were exaggerated . The comedian said he gave the New Yorker so much evidence that they ignored when it comes to these three stories . Most of that evidence is related to the prom story . Though Minhaj said in the video that I do give a s t about prom , a third of the 21 minute video is devoted to the incident . The first piece of evidence Minhaj provided to counteract the New Yorker article are emails from Bethany , the white woman who rejected Minhaj from prom allegedly due to his race . In both the New Yorker account and in Minhaj defense , the comedian admits his rejection did not happen on her doorstep as claimed in his special Homecoming King but days before , a detail the woman in question corroborates . Minhaj said the New Yorker account makes it sound like I got friend zoned by Bethany and then I turned into an angry incel and faked racism to get back at her . To prove this rejection was due to his race and not due to differing accounts , he leaked emails from Bethany after her marriage to an Indian American man that were sent in 2015 . In one of her responses , she wrote , I think my parents have come a long way , too , a detail Minhaj pointed to as proof that her and her parents rejection of him originally stemmed from racism . Minhaj also disputed Bethany claim that he invited her to an Off Broadway performance of Homecoming King to humiliate her and that he insufficiently disguised her identity . In the New Yorker article , she claimed this led to personal threats and being doxxed . As proof he was not to blame for this doxxing , he provided emails in which he said he put Bethany in contact with fact checkers from This American Life , invited her to the Netflix press party and asked her to delete a social media post that could possibly reveal her identity . The other two stories Minhaj defends are far graver than a prom date gone wrong . In both cases he admitted to embellishing stories in his stand up act and apologized to audiences . Hasan Minhaj confirms in this video that he selectively presents information and embellishes to make a point : exactly what we reported , the New Yorker said in a statement . Our piece , which includes Minhaj perspective at length , was carefully reported and fact checked . It is based on interviews with more than 20 people , including former Patriot Act and Daily Show staffers ; members of Minhaj security team ; and people who have been the subject of his stand up work , including the former informant Brother Eric and the woman at the center of his prom rejection story . We stand by our story . In his special The King Jester Minhaj tells the story of Brother Eric , an informant who gains the trust of his mosque community and slams the comedian on the roof of a car after Minhaj messes with him . Both in the New Yorker article and in his defense , Minhaj admitted that Brother Eric was real and he was not Craig Monteilh , the real life informant who spied on Islamic communities and whom Minhaj claims harassed him as a teenager . Instead , he said the character was an amalgamation of undercover agents in his community he knew about as a teenager . In the video , he apologized for the story . The truth is I did have altercations with undercover law enforcement growing up and that experience formed the basis of this story , but it did go down exactly like this , Minhaj said . My intention was to take away from these stories . It was to spotlight them in my special . Finally , the comedian detailed the oddest of his exaggerated stories , the anthrax scare . In The King Jester , Minhaj claimed that a letter containing a fine white powder was sent to his home as part of the backlash to his work on Netflix Patriot Act . In the special as well as in other interviews , Minhaj claimed that the powder , which was believed to be anthrax , fell onto his daughter who was rushed to the hospital . In both the New Yorker article and in this video , Minhaj admitted this story was embellished . The comedian now says the a letter with white powder was sent to his apartment in February of 2019 after Netflix pulled an episode of Patriot Act that was critical of Saudi Arabia . The powder spilled on the kitchen counter , which was near Minhaj daughter , but the child never came in contact with the substance and there was never a hospital visit . I created the hospital scene to put the audience in that same shock and fear that me and Beena Patel felt playing out that night , Minhaj said of his wife . As for why he never told Netflix about the anthrax scare , he said he did do so out of fear Netflix would shut down Patriot Act . Minhaj spends the last few minutes of this response directly criticizing the New Yorker over the final lines in the original article , in which Minhaj is quoted as saying , the emotional truth is first . The factual truth is secondary . Minhaj said that statement referred to his persona as a storyteller and not as a political comedian and host of series like The Daily Show and Patriot Act . With political comedy the truth comes first , comedy sometimes comes second to make the infotainment the sugar on the medicine . In stand up , the emotional truth is first , the factual truth is secondary , Minhaj said in his original interview with the New Yorker . Though Minhaj insisted in the video that fact checking was paramount to series like The Daily Show and Patriot Act , the comedian never addressed the accusations that researchers were kicked out of the Patriot Act writers room . Fact checking at Patriot Act was extremely rigorous , Minhaj told the New Yorker in a written statement in the original article . The Hollywood Reporter was the first to obtain Minhaj video .',\n",

Israeli forces attacked 44 places in Gaza and killed 756 citizens over the past 24 hours , the ministry statement read , adding that it had received reports of missing people still under the rubble , including 900 children . Though many of those trapped are thought to be dead , a number are believed to be alive with no way to reach them , leaving them to suffer a slow death . As a result of the high casualty rates , and the forced displacement of Palestinians , hospitals are operating at only 30 per cent of staffing levels . This means that hospitals can no longer provide even basic clinical care to the wounded Some 73 health care workers have been killed in Israel bombing and 25 ambulances destroyed . Twelve hospitals and 32 health care centres are now out of service due to direct and indirect Israeli targeting and a lack of fuel due to the ongoing siege , the ministry added .

              " 'JMA says field hospital for Gaza in the works as healthcare system on verge of collapse Palestinians evacuate a wounded man after an Israeli strike near an United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees UNRWA school in Khan Yunis , in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday AFP photo by Mahmud Hams AMMAN The Jordan Medical Association JMA has announced its preparations to establish a field hospital at a cost of million for rapid deployment to Gaza , with the aim of aiding the \" collapsing \" medical sector in Gaza . These efforts are taking place at a time when the Ministry of Health in the Gaza Strip has declared a crisis . Hospitals are facing shortages in clinical , pharmaceutical and fuel resources due to the escalated Israeli bombardment . Despite nearly 3 per cent of the required medical aid having departed from the Egyptian side of Rafah crossing , intended for delivery to Gaza , Palestinian authorities have expressed concerns that the exclusion of fuel from humanitarian aid continues to endanger the lives of patients and the wounded , as well as the continuity of life saving services . This is because Gaza hospitals have depleted their resources entirely due to the absence of even the most basic urgent medical supplies , including fuel . Simultaneously , the Ministry of Health in Gaza announced the closure of four hospitals and the bombing of Baptist Hospital , as the number of infections among Gazans has exceeded . The Gaza health authorities have reported that hospital bed occupancy in the Gaza Strip has exceeded 150 per cent , forcing hospitals to set up multiple tents to accommodate the wounded and patients , as reported by Al Mamlaka TV . Israeli violations against medical teams have resulted in the martyrdom of 51 healthcare workers and the injury of 87 others , according to Al Mamlaka . The total casualties of the Israeli aggression have risen to martyrs , including children and 967 women , in addition to wounded individuals . Seventy per cent of the casualties of the Israeli aggression are children , women , and the elderly , Al Mamlaka added . Ziad Al , the president of JMA , told The Jordan Times that the association is in contact with various international companies specialised in field hospitals to purchase and transport the facility . It is expected to be operational within 10 days , with an estimated cost that may reach up to million . This hospital will be operational during and after the conflict , added . The JMA president emphasised that a total of 400 doctors have volunteered to go to Gaza to provide medical care to the wounded , in addition to hundreds of general practitioners . However , the lack of authorisation to enter the region with aid and medical teams is currently a major obstacle . Moreover , a total of 20 Jordanian doctors have recently departed to Egypt as part of the Miles and Smiles campaign , and they are currently awaiting permission to bring in medical aid and join the medical teams working in Gaza hospitals , said . He added that the association is in close communication with various international organisations , the Arab Medical Union in Cairo and the Egyptian Doctors Union to facilitate the delivery of aid and the procurement and transfer of a fully equipped field hospital to Gaza . The field hospital will be strategically situated in a nearby area of the centre to ensure rapid access for the wounded and medical cases , said . He explained that medical professionals will work in shifts at this hospital , serving as a complement to the Jordanian field hospital administered by the Jordanian Armed Forces Arab Army . emphasised the critical need for medicines , medical supplies , surgical expertise , nursing staff and support services in Gaza hospitals . He noted that the donations received by the association will be allocated for this purpose . Some medical supplies and necessities will be procured from Egypt , but the primary focus remains on ensuring their timely delivery to Gaza , in addition to providing essential food aid to Gazans , added .',\n",
              " 'China missing Defence Minister fired two months after his disappearance Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu was fired on Tuesday , the of October , after disappearing from the public eye for nearly two months , in what appears to be part of an effort to remove senior Chinese officials , reports Politico . Chinese national broadcaster CCTV reported on Tuesday that Li Shangfu had been suspended as defence minister and member of the State Council , without giving further details or specifying who would replace him . Chinese Defence Minister Li was last reportedly seen in Beijing on the of August , before his ministry suddenly cancelled a planned visit to Vietnam in September due to health reasons . This is the second time in three months that a senior official has been dismissed from the administration of Chinese President Xi Jinping after an unexplained absence . Earlier this year , Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang was also dismissed after disappearing from public view for several weeks , which Beijing attributed to health reasons . As CCTV reported on Tuesday , Qin Gang , who had initially retained his position as a member of the State Council , has also been dismissed of that post , and China Minister of Science and Technology and Minister of Finance was also reported dismissed .

              " 'Gaza Shifa Hospital : medical centre or Hamas headquarters ? Browse Home Featured Articles Gaza Shifa Hospital : medical centre or Hamas headquarters ? J Wire Gaza Shifa Hospital : medical centre or Hamas headquarters ? Read on for article While the Al Ahli Hospital in northern Gaza has been the epicentre of international attention , another hospital in the Strip will likely be in the headlines after a widely expected Israeli ground invasion begins . Shifa Hospital , located in the North Rimal neighbourhood and boasting 570 beds , is Gaza largest medical centre , serving the medical needs of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians . But as Gazans are already aware , Hamas makes extensive use of the hospital too . Knowing that Israel would not dare attack a hospital during a war , Hamas leaders hide there , launch rockets from its compound , hide hostages in the bowels of the building , torture collaborators , and dig tunnels connecting Shifa to nearby sites . As far back as 2009 , the Israeli Security Agency Shin Bet reported during the Gaza war of that year that Hamas operatives were hiding in the hospital , and that the basement had become Hamas headquarters . But it was during the Gaza war of 2014 that Hamas activities in Shifa became too pervasive to miss . Foreign media reported that Hamas located its main offices inside Shifa Hospital and some journalists recounted seeing senior Hamas officials in its corridors . Abdel Bari Atwan , a prominent Arab editor said he even saw rocket launches from the hospital compound with his own eyes . After the war , one Hamas operative captured by the Shin Bet confirmed that leaders of the terror group hid in the hospital during all the days of fighting . And an Amnesty International report on the war released in 2015 accused Hamas of using a disused outpatient clinic to interrogate and torture suspected collaborators . Three Palestinians died in custody , Amnesty reported . Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was reportedly kept in a booby trapped tunnel shaft below the hospital for periods of his five year captivity , and it is likely that at least some of the 203 hostages taken by Hamas are there too . Shifa was originally built by British authorities in 1946 . In the , Israel renovated and expanded the hospital as part of an initiative to improve Gaza living conditions . A source in Gaza told the Tazpit Press Service that during periods of heightened security tensions , portions of Shifa Hospital are routinely sealed off to the public . This restricts access for Gaza residents to various buildings and structures adjacent to the hospital . Additionally , senior Hamas officials are known to receive medical treatment there , especially during military operations . In recent days , the Israeli Defense Forces have bombed and demolished several buildings close to Shifa Hospital . A Palestinian source in Gaza told the Tazpit Press Service that those buildings are well known Hamas sites widely believed to be connected to Shifa by underground tunnels . One of the buildings just 60 meters from Shifa was used to produce and repair weapons , including rockets , Israeli security officials said several years ago . Placing weapons caches , command and control centres , tunnel shafts , rocket launchers and other military infrastructure in close proximity to private homes , schools , hospitals , mosques and civilian areas violates international humanitarian law . Israeli leaders insist they will eliminate Hamas from Gaza . How the military deals with the Shifa Hospital remains to be seen .',\n",

              " 'Another Hospital in Gaza Is Bleeding The New Yorker has been speaking with doctors at a hospital in southern Gaza , Nasser Medical Center , where conditions have been rapidly deteriorating during the Israeli bombing campaign . Scroll down to read the report , and turn on audio to hear excerpts of the interviews . Omar al Najjar : This war began at its peak . Began at peak destruction . The New Yorker : Have you lost hope in living in Gaza ? Omar al Najjar : Gaza is the place we were born and raised . However much they try to frighten and scare us , I agree with my family that I ca ever leave Gaza . News Desk Another Hospital in Gaza Is Bleeding Doctors in southern Gaza are overwhelmed by the dead and the wounded and by displaced Palestinians sleeping on the floor . The baby arrived at Nasser Medical Center , in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis , just before noon on the tenth day of Israel bombing campaign . An air strike had hit the home of a local family , who had been hosting a family of displaced people from Gaza City , to the north . Dozens were injured or killed . Doctors in the emergency room scrambled to assess the newcomers and discovered the still body of an infant boy . He was covered in a thick layer of debris . As a medic began compressions on the baby chest , Mohammed Zaqout , a senior pediatrician and the former director of the hospital , came over to examine the infant and detected a breath . Praise God , the baby did have any injuries ! , Ayman al Farra , a Gaza health official who has worked in the hospital emergency room since the start of the conflict , told us , in a telephone interview . But who were the boy parents , and what was his name ? The baby was hardly the first unidentified patient the doctors had treated since Israel began bombing Gaza . Omar al Najjar , a twenty four year old intern stationed in the emergency room , explained in a phone interview that when an air strike hits a home , it often injures or kills everyone in a family , leaving no one available to identify the dead and wounded . So we write Unknown 1 , Unknown 2 , Unknown 3 , he said . An unidentified but otherwise healthy baby was an unusual circumstance but Najjar scarcely had time to notice . We do feel the beginning or the end of the day , because we are continuously in the , he told us .

A boy wounded by an Israeli air strike is brought into Nasser Medical Center in Khan Younis , in southern Gaza , on October . Photograph by Yousef Masoud NYT Redux Najjar lives east of Khan Younis , in a town that is half a mile from the fortified barrier that marks the border with Israel . His grandparents had lived in a village near the coastal city of Jaffa , in what is now Israel , and had fled to Gaza as refugees . On the morning of October , Najjar had been asleep at home when Hamas fighters broke through the barrier and slaughtered fourteen hundred Israelis in surrounding towns . The next day , the Israel Defense Forces instructed the residents of Najjar town , via text , to evacuate immediately . Najjar family fled to Khan Younis : his parents squeezed into the home of a relative , in the center of town , while his pregnant sister and her family moved into a United Nations school for refugees . Najjar himself began living full time at the hospital where he worked , sleeping on the floor of the office of internal medicine . Administrators placed the hospital staff about a thousand people on alternating twenty four hour shifts ; Najjar usually helps out during his days off , too . In any case , he noted , I do have a place to return to . On the eighth day of air strikes , he learned that Israeli bombs had destroyed his home and flattened the area around it . Top : a map of Israel and Palestine , showing Palestinian territories in green . Bottom : a street map of Khan Younis , in southern Gaza . Left : a street map of Khan Younis , in southern Gaza . Right : a map of Israel and Palestine , showing Palestinian territories in green . Farra , the health official working in the emergency room , told us that hundreds of other doctors and nurses are also living at the hospital , sleeping on mattress pads in overcrowded hallways and offices . There not a nurses room or doctor office that does have twenty staff members in it , he said . As hundreds of thousands of Gazans have fled the bombs and an expected ground invasion from Israel , thousands of healthy people have also moved into the hospital complex . To the doctors frustration , the displaced have bedded down in courtyards , in corridors , and even atop roofs . They put their bags down , and that becomes their place , Najjar told us . There not one place that empty . Clogged hallways and elevators are slowing down medical staff and inhibiting the transport of patients , and the swelling population is straining the hospital limited supply of well water . But what can the hospital do ? Waleed Abu Hatab , the director of maternal medicine , told us , We ca stop them from using the bathrooms or water there no way we can do that . So far , the hospital has remained an island of safety . Repeated air strikes have destroyed much of the surrounding neighborhood . In photographs , the pale red brick tower of the Nasser Medical Center now stands like a lighthouse overlooking a sea of rubble . A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told us that they do not target hospitals . But , as the siege continues , conditions inside are deteriorating . During a phone call with us , Farra called out to a colleague , Ibrahim , did bread come today ? The answer was no . Farra and other doctors told us that since the war began the hospital has been feeding its patients and staff only rice for lunch and dinner , sometimes adding cheese and cucumbers at the evening meal . The Health Ministry ca bring fruit now , because it in very short supply , Farra said . I was at a vegetable market earlier , and the prices are very high . We ca provide them . Omar al Najjar , a twenty four year old medical intern , has been living at the Nasser Medical Center since the bombardment started . Many people have taken refuge at the hospital and are also sheltering there full time . Omar al Najjar , a twenty four year old medical intern , has been living at the Nasser Medical Center since the bombardment started . Many people have taken refuge at the hospital and are also sheltering there full time . The hospital , which is designed to accommodate three hundred and fifty inpatients , is dangerously overfull : administrators have tripled the number of beds in the emergency room to sixty , doubled the number of operating rooms to twelve , and expanded the intensive care unit from twelve beds to forty . Yet , even in the intensive care unit , some of the wounded must be laid on the ground or in the hall , because there are not enough beds . Najjar , the intern , told us that the victims of bombings always arrive in large numbers at least ten at a time . Farra told us , All the injuries are serious they require surgeries and intensive care . He continued , The medicine has been depleted . The anesthesia has been depleted . There are shortages of chest tubes , dialysis filters , saline solution , and orthopedic equipment . Najjar told us that he was forced to tell a patient with a face wound to go out to a local drug store to buy the supplies needed to stitch up the gash . The hospital biggest crisis , however , is its dwindling supply of fuel and electricity . Farra said that the hospital typically burns thirteen hundred gallons of fuel a day to produce its own electricity during the frequent blackouts that afflict Gaza . Now the Israeli siege has entirely cut off the power ; when we spoke , Farra said that there was only enough fuel left for two or three more days . To conserve power for surgeries and intensive care , the hospital had already shut off the electricity in many of its units , such as pediatrics and internal medicine . The mortuary refrigerators , of course , have stopped operating , so we ca hold on to the deceased and their numbers are big , Farra added . We are fearful that we will have to make mass graves . Najjar told us that another Gazan hospital was storing the dead in ice cream trucks . The New Yorker : Are you going to take austerity measures ? Ayman al Farra : The maximum austerity measures have been taken . Electricity has been turned off in many units . The mortuary refrigerators , of course , have stopped operating . So we ca hold on to the deceased . We are fearful that we have to make mass graves . The lack of electricity is also threatening to close the dialysis unit , even though it now serves an influx of new patients from the north of Gaza . Thousands of people will die , Farra said . Without electricity , the pumps that draw water from the hospital wells would also stop working . We reaching the point in which we have to shut down , Farra said . The patients are going to die in front of us , and we not going to be able to do anything . Early on October , the Gaza Health Ministry sent out an urgent distress call to all gas station owners and anyone who has any liter of diesel , asking for donations to save the lives of the wounded and sick . Farra told us that , at the direction of Gaza Health Ministry , hospital administrators have begun preserving resources by denying care that the hospital would normally provide to patients whose chances of recovery are considered slim . We make a decision not to put them on a ventilator , and we give the opportunity to someone who has hopes of living . The bodies of people killed by Israeli air strikes lie in a makeshift morgue outside the Nasser Medical Center . The bodies of people killed by Israeli air strikes lie in a makeshift morgue outside the Nasser Medical Center . Photograph by Samar Abu Elouf NYT Redux On October , Farra said , the hospital had reluctantly removed three struggling patients from the intensive care unit . One was a ten year old boy whose brain had been penetrated by shrapnel . From his pupils , we were able to surmise that he was likely brain dead , he told us . We need beds for other patients . The boy died that night , Farra later confirmed . Other doctors did not want to discuss such painful trade offs . Abu Hatab , the head of maternal medicine , insisted that the hospital was denying care only rarely . If this happened with one or two cases , it would have been only after several doctors said that the case is totally hopeless , he told us , adding , Unfortunately , we have to do things that are very far away from ideal practices in medicine . But Farra and Najjar said that even the is becoming increasingly selective about which incoming patients are given intensive care . Farra said that the hopeless cases are given a place where they are followed closely , but they do get the intervention that they normally would . Working with them will make us lose time that could be spent saving others . Najjar said that admitting a patient can take up to two hours because doctors must be persuaded to free up a bed by discharging another patient . On October , a young boy had arrived at the hospital with a head wound that required surgery , but all the operating rooms were full and there was no free ventilator , which was needed to keep him alive . Najjar recalled , We were told there are no beds left in the intensive care unit , but we told the , No , he has to go in , that wo work . After four hours of tense negotiations , the made a ventilator available for the boy by unplugging an older patient and transferring him to an oxygen tank . The boy life was saved , Naggar told us ; the older patient fate was unclear . Doctors , too , are dying in Gaza . Najjar told us that he knew of several who had been killed by air strikes : the dean of his medical school , a friend who worked at a Gaza City hospital , a burn surgeon on a brief visit home , a family doctor , alongside her husband and her children . Another victim , an eminent pathologist , was a personal mentor of Najjar . When he heard the news , he said , I could hold myself together I walked over to a corner and started crying . Every couple of days , Najjar briefly leaves the hospital to check on his family , and he worries that a bomb might end his life on the way . You also see piles of trash around you , people sleeping on the ground outside , destroyed homes , he noted . All of this makes you anxious . On the fifth day of the war , Najjar heard the sound of a strike not far from the hospital . The first patient to reach the was one of his relatives . He was badly bruised and burned in many places , and one of his hands had been wounded . The relative was conscious enough to convey that Najjar parents who were staying in a house next to the site of the blast had survived . But the bombing killed five of their relatives , one of whom was disfigured beyond recognition . Najjar told us that a cousin had come to the hospital to identify the bodies . Injured children being treated at the Nasser Medical Center . Injured children being treated at the Nasser Medical Center . Photograph by Mohammed Talatene dpa AP You try to hold it together , Najjar told us . But then , on October , he heard the news that an explosion had destroyed the Arab Ahli hospital in Gaza City killing hundreds , according to initial reports . The Israeli military and intelligence agencies say that a malfunctioning missile fired by Palestinian militants struck the Gaza City hospital ; Hamas has blamed an Israeli air strike . At the same moment , several injured members of a prominent family in Khan Younis were arriving at Nasser Medical Center . Najjar told us , I was able to endure it . I was supposed to help the wounded , but I went to a corner and fell to the ground . It took him ten minutes to regain his composure and resume treating patients . When Najjar was asked how he felt about Hamas which controls Gaza and the attack that triggered Israel retaliation , he said that he could not answer . Associates of his told us that Najjar , like many young Palestinians , had long ago soured on the leadership of all the competing Palestinian political factions . To us , he said only that the ordeal of the war had destroyed what was left of the hope he had placed in the international community . Najjar said , No one can get humanitarian aid in , how are they going to stop the war ? How are they going to do justice for us and give us a state ? The world powers , he said , were biased for and afraid of Israel so where will the solution come from ? Farra , the health official , was less guarded . He said that , about twenty years ago , he had worked for seven months on a cardiac ward at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center . Gadi Keren , an Israeli cardiologist there , warmly recalled working with Nasser staff . There are many great people in Gaza , he told us . He then said of Hamas , Unfortunately , this terror group is destroying the lives of more than two million . Farra told us that his experience of the world outside Gaza had reinforced his conviction that both Hamas and the Israeli military were wrong to target civilians . Hamas assault on October , he said , was absolutely unacceptable . A woman cradles the body of a child who was killed in an Israeli strike .

Photograph by Mohammed Salem Reuters Farra praised the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , who in the nineteen nineties launched the Oslo Accords , which laid out a path to a two state solution . We want to live in peace , side by side , but killing entire families like this there wo be any chance for peace and coexistence left , he said . Extremism and narrow mindedness caused this catastrophe , and it will be reflected across the entire region . Every action has a reaction . Everyone who lost a family member wants to take revenge . On both sides , it leads to violence and extremism . Given Hamas tight control of Gaza , very few residents have so openly criticized the assault . But Farra insisted that , despite the deaths caused by Israel air strikes , there were many other Gazans who still shared his peaceable views . We are people who love life . Who love peace . These are deadly wars that are bringing destruction for everyone .',\n",

              " 'Giannis Antetokounmpo indicates on social media that he agreed to contract extension with Bucks Giannis Antetokounmpo has indicated on social media that he has agreed to a contract extension with the Milwaukee Bucks . Antetokounmpo issued a social media post on Monday that said , MILWAUKEEEEEEEEE ! ! Let get it ! ! ! ! BucksInSix Extended . The post came as ESPN reported that the two time MVP had agreed on a three year extension worth 186 million , with a player option for the 2027 28 season . The Bucks did make an official announcement , but they reposted Antetokounmpo post on X , the social media site formerly known as Twitter . The Bucks repost , which was later deleted , included the message , The best possible cure for the Mondays . Antetokounmpo announcement came as Minnesota Jaden McDaniels , Washington Deni Avdija and Orlando Cole Anthony led the first wave of fourth year players to reach agreements on contract extensions ahead of the NBA deadline . Antetokounmpo had said this summer that he did plan to sign an extension this year because it would make more financial sense for him to wait until the summer . The two time MVP also had indicated that he wanted to wait to see how committed the Bucks were toward winning another title before he decided on whether to sign an extension on his contract , which at the time ran through 2024 25 with a player option for 2025 26 . Since then , the Bucks made a blockbuster trade to acquire seven time all NBA guard Damian Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers . Even after that trade , Antetokounmpo had indicated he did expect to sign an extension this year . I said that it did not make sense to sign the contract right now because money not important a lot of money is important . So I going to sign it next year , Antetokounmpo said with a laugh during the Bucks Media Day event on 2 . But , no , at the end of the day , again , it does make sense . It does not make sense for me to sign it right now . I got to always look at what best for me and my family , for my situation . But at the end of the day , I want to be a Milwaukee Buck for the rest of my career , as long as we are winning . It as simple as that . The extension starts with the 2025 26 season , meaning Antetokounmpo is under contract for at least four more years and a fifth if he so inclined . He will earn about million over the next two seasons , then about 120 million more for the 2025 26 and 2026 27 seasons . The last year is at his option , meaning he could make roughly 66 million more in 2027 28 . And if Antetokounmpo had waited until next summer to agree to an extension , he possibly may have secured earned even more money . A max extension scenario had he waited until 2024 could have been a four year agreement at a figure exceeding 250 million . As far as the extensions involving fourth year players , agent Bill Duffy confirmed that McDaniels and the Timberwolves agreed on a five year , 136 million extension . The overall pick in 2020 , who came to Minnesota in the same draft as star Anthony Edwards , had a breakout third season with an average of points per game on shooting . With three maximum contract players on the roster in Edwards , Karl Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert , the Timberwolves have committed themselves to the luxury tax range with their salary cap . But the 6 McDaniels is the team best defender and one of the league best shutdown wings , and the Timberwolves believe he has untapped offensive potential to pair with his defensive ability . I feel like , shoot , I can go out and score 25 points every night if I wanted to , McDaniels said at the beginning of training camp . The Timberwolves open their season at Toronto on Wednesday . McDaniels currently has a calf injury , putting his status for the game in doubt . Avdija agreed to a four year , 55 million extension with the Wizards , a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press . The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team had announced the agreement . The 22 year old Avdija started a career high 40 games last season and averaged points and rebounds . Washington drafted him in the first round in 2020 . Avdija is somewhat remarkably the longest tenured player on the Wizards . They traded Bradley Beal to Phoenix in the offseason and enter 2023 24 with a significantly different roster . Avdija , a 6 forward from Israel , has averaged points in 212 career games since the Wizards made him the ninth overall pick in the 2020 draft . Anthony and the Magic agreed to a three year , 39 million extension , which the team announced Monday . The son of 11 year NBA veteran Greg Anthony , he was the overall pick in the 2020 draft . The point guard missed more than a month last season with an oblique muscle injury and saw his scoring average drop by more than three points per game . After starting all 65 games he played in during the 2021 22 season with Markelle Fultz sidelined by injury , Anthony returned to a role off the bench once Fultz was back in the starting lineup . But Anthony shot a career best from the field , including from 3 point range , and reduced his turnovers by an average of more than one per game . Elsewhere , the San Antonio Spurs announced a multiyear extension for center Zach Collins . The overall pick in the 2017 draft averaged a career high points per game last season . Also , the Atlanta Hawks signed forward center Onyeka Okongwu to a four year , 62 million rookie contract extension . Okongwu has started in 28 of 178 career games , averaging points and rebounds . He could play a larger role this season , following the trade of power forward John Collins to Utah . The deal with Okongwu came after the team exercised the fourth year contract option on forward Jalen Johnson and the third year option on guard AJ Griffin . The Dallas Mavericks and Josh Green agreed on a 41 million , three year contract extension coming off the most productive of the guard three seasons . News of the deal comes two days before the Mavericks open the regular season in San Antonio , with Green set to see how he fits with a retooled roster around stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving . A first round draft pick in 2020 , Green has provided energy and athleticism off the bench , with more of an impact in 2022 23 than the Australian first two seasons . Green , who turns 23 next month , missed 20 games with a right elbow sprain last season but still started a career high 21 games while averaging points and rebounds .

              " 'Bloodbath on D Street : Why Sensex tumbled over 800 points today Benchmark stock market indices witnessed a significant decline on Thursday , with both benchmark indices experiencing a prolonged losing streak . The BSE Sensex plummeted by points to , while the NSE Nifty 50 dropped below , shedding over 246 points . This marks the longest losing streak for the benchmark indices in eight months . The broader domestic market indices , including Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 , were not immune to the downturn , both registering declines of over 2 per cent . Adding to the unease , India VIX , a measure of market volatility , surged by 10 percent , indicating a tense atmosphere on Dalal Street . advertisement Bloodbath on Dalal Street Various sectoral indices experienced substantial losses , with prominent sectors like Nifty Bank , Nifty Financial Services , and Nifty IT falling between per cent and per cent . Nifty Media and Nifty Realty were among the hardest hit , with both sectoral indices declining over per cent . While the majority of blue chip stocks faced a downturn , Axis Bank and HCLTech were notable gainers on the benchmark indices . Analysts had anticipated this market correction due to the consistent decline observed in recent trading sessions . Factors behind weakness The substantial downturn today is attributed to a combination of factors , including global market weakness , concerns about rising US Treasury yields , escalating geopolitical tensions , and the monthly expiry . IT stocks bore the brunt of the market concern , primarily due to fears of a potential increase in interest rates , driven by the rise in US Treasury yields . Additionally , disappointing results from major IT firms contributed to the subdued market sentiment . Tech Mahindra , in particular , experienced a decline of more than 3 per cent in early trade , as it reported its most significant drop in net profit in over 16 years . Many brokerages have expressed concerns about the company future growth prospects . Another contributing factor was the decline in Adani Group stocks , with all 10 listed companies within the conglomerate falling . This followed a report suggesting that the National Financial Reporting Authority NFRA , India accounting regulator , was scrutinising one of the group auditors . The Nifty Financial Services index saw a sharp downturn , largely due to the decline of financial heavyweights Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv , which both fell by nearly 3 per cent . Global stocks , led by the US , also witnessed a decline , which had a cascading effect on Indian market sentiments . With the 10 year bond yield in the US approaching 5 percent , foreign investors are likely to engage in selling activities . Additionally , the ongoing Israel Hamas war raised concerns about potential global growth derailment and its impact on high oil importing nations like India .',\n",

Wp Get the full experience . Choose your plan ArrowRight Dire scenarios await Gaza medical professionals . They face dwindling basic resources such as power , water and anesthesia , compelling doctors to confront wrenching decisions on whose lives to save . The growing humanitarian crisis is plunging health care workers into the critical emergency planning that follows both human made and natural disasters assessing staffing and other resources , managing existing health needs on top of gruesome new ones , and looking out for their own welfare . When we are in a disaster setting or conflict , we usually have more patients than resources . We have to be very creative to be able to provide the best care for the most number of people , said Lindsey Ryan Martin , who is director of global disaster response and humanitarian action at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and has been monitoring the situation in Gaza . Advertisement The health care crisis extends beyond Tuesday deadly blast at al Ahli Hospital in Gaza City . Aid organizations say the war continues to imperil an already beleaguered health care system . Gaza Health Ministry said five hospitals were out of service as of Thursday and an additional 14 health facilities have closed because they lack fuel and electricity . After Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross border attack into Israel on 7 , Israel imposed a full siege on the Gaza Strip , cutting off electricity , food and fuel and limiting access to medical supplies and cross border travel for high risk diagnoses or operations . Assessing and verifying the realities of medical care on the ground in Gaza has been difficult because of challenges communicating with medical professionals and limited access for reporters . Advertisement aid chief Martin Griffiths told The Washington Post on Wednesday that the hospital blast worsened the humanitarian crisis in Gaza , putting out of commission a hospital that treated patients per year . Health workers , why would they stay ? Griffiths said . And how can you move the sick people that we already been discussing for the last few days , coming out of the hospital in Gaza City how can you move them when they in ICUs ? After the blast at al Ahli , Palestinian health officials said the flood of patients to nearby al Shifa , the main hospital in Gaza City , exceeded the capabilities of medical teams and ambulances . They said doctors resorted to treating wounded patients on the hospital floor , some without anesthesia . An anesthesia specialist at al Shifa told The Post that bodies have been left in the hallway after attempts to save people failed . He shared a video that he had taken showing a chaotic scene : patients being treated on a teal floor , a man imploring others to take out a dead body to bring in another patient . Advertisement The hospital worker , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment to reporters , worries about infections rising because of the lack of clean water and electricity to desalinate the water supply . He already seeing infections , diarrhea and fevers on the rise and fears more dehydration in children . The hospital worker said he last slept properly on 5 , before the conflict began , and does know whether his home is still standing . It also the last time I saw my wife and my kids , he said . Erica Nelson , who has worked in humanitarian medicine for about 25 years , said Palestinian doctors at al Shifa who are in her WhatsApp group are becoming more fearful of being targeted . The additional component of We are at risk has changed the tenor of the conversation , said Nelson , an emergency physician at Brigham and Women Hospital in Boston . Advertisement International aid organizations in recent days added to the portrait of a tattered health care system in Gaza . Share this article Share The World Health Organization WHO said medicine for hundreds of thousands of patients is in short supply . Airstrikes have made operating ambulances and transferring patients to health facilities extremely dangerous , according to Doctors Without Borders , which has staff on the ground in Gaza . The agency for Palestinian refugees , known as UNRWA , said Wednesday that fewer than half of its health centers could offer basic care to patients . All three organizations confirmed reports that lives are in jeopardy as generators run out of fuel . The WHO has called on Israel to allow shipments of fuel as part of a deal brokered to permit humanitarian aid to Gaza . When fuel runs out , that may mean operating with flashlights or taking care of people with medications that do require refrigeration and certainly not having lab services , said John Broach , director of the division of emergency medical services and disaster management at UMass Memorial in Worcester , Advertisement Broach said the struggle to care for patients injured in a war or disaster is exacerbated by the escalation of routine medical issues suddenly left untreated , such as people with well managed diabetes now unable to take insulin spoiled when refrigerators lose power and chronically ill patients unable to fill prescriptions at shuttered pharmacies . David Callaway , chief medical officer for veteran led Team Rubicon , a Los Angeles based nonprofit group that works closely with the WHO to provide relief in humanitarian crises , said there are dangerous consequences to health care workers toiling nonstop with limited resources during disasters . Soon all the team is burned out , their empathy is gone and they are not making best decisions , said Callaway , who served as a battalion surgeon during the Iraq War and more recently oversaw humanitarian aid his organization provided in Ukraine . The decisions health care workers face in disasters are momentous : As they focus on the patient in front of them , they are acutely aware of massive needs elsewhere . You feel like you have to put different values on different lives based on what you see in the moment , Callaway said . Is a kid life more valuable than an elderly person ? Thomas Kirsch , an emergency medicine physician at George Washington University Hospital and an early practitioner of disaster medicine , recalled the moral dilemmas that came up when he was working with a Johns Hopkins team in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake . Advertisement Resources simply were not available to treat everyone in need , he said . You can be forced into a situation where you ca do what best for your patient , either causing a patient harm or allowing them to die , Kirsch said . Those decisions , he said , are best taken out of the hands of the person providing care , by creating an ethics counselor or committee . At the same time , disasters force providers to come up with systematic ways to tailor the care they are able to provide . Can you scrub without soap ? Re use sterile drapes ? Boil water on a stove ? Kirsch said . Some superficial surgical procedures can be performed without anesthesia , Kirsch said , evoking images of Civil War era operations . But you ca operate on the heart , the lungs , the abdomen , he said . Paul Spiegel , director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , says doctors in conflict zones operate in ways they were never trained to do . As a young general practitioner caring for severely mutilated patients during the Rwandan genocide , Spiegel said he followed instructions the best he could , amputating fingers and addressing other grisly wounds despite having no specialized training in those procedures . You have no choice , he said . You tell yourself you probably do it better than a layperson . The health care system in the Gaza Strip , which has been under Israeli blockade for 16 years , already struggled before the war . The Israeli Civil Administration controls the entry and exit of all patients and goods , which can restrict care . Recent attacks that damaged medical infrastructure are reminiscent of conflict in 2014 , when 24 medical facilities were damaged and more than 15 health workers were killed in a 50 day Israeli offensive in Gaza . Experts say war leaves lasting scars on health care systems as officials face the daunting task of rebuilding facilities and rebuilding trust in patients afraid to seek care after places of healing turned into danger zones . Advertisement For months , years afterward , this community is still going to have a disrupted health care system , said Rohini Haar , a medical adviser at Physicians for Human Rights who has researched the aftermath of war on health care systems . The folks in a community that are attacked are going to be experiencing this attack for years after . Dadouch reported from Beirut . Claire Parker in Cairo , Kyle Rempfer in Washington , Louisa Loveluck in London and Miriam Berger in Jerusalem contributed to this report .',\n",

              " 'The Whole Health System Is Collapsing Around Us . Doctors Say Gaza Is on the Brink Even before this week deadly hospital blast , Gaza health system was already on the brink of collapse . At least Palestinians in Gaza have been declared dead since the beginning of the Israeli Hamas war , and an estimated have been injured , according to the Gaza Health Ministry . Gaza health system has faced a huge influx of emergency patients , while at the same time suffering the effects of bombardment and having utilities cut . On October 13 , the Israeli military told everyone in the north of Gaza to evacuate . This created an impossible situation for hospitals filled with patients who were too unwell to be moved . The World Health Organization said the evacuation order was a death sentence for the sick and injured . The whole health system is collapsing around us , says Ghassan Abu Sittah , a plastic surgeon with Médecins Sans Frontières MSF who is working in Gaza at Al Shifa Hospital , the biggest medical facility in the Gaza Strip , located in Gaza City . He paints a picture of a system stripped down to the bare bones . The orthopedic department has run out of the pins and rods needed to stabilize fractures , Abu Sittah says . The water pressure has become too weak to run the sterilization machines that disinfect equipment , meaning the hospital staff are forced to rely on a chemical antiseptic that has been commonly used for decades . There are no ventilators available . There is not even enough room for the injured in the hospital . There is no more space or mattresses to put the wounded on in the corridors , says Abu Sittah . Health care staff are exhausted and are struggling to deal with the overwhelming number of injured . On October 18 , Abu Sittah helped treat a patient with a wound that had become infected and septic . But with all operating rooms full , doctors could not treat it in time , and the patient will lose a leg as a result . Since Israel blocked access to electricity in Gaza more than a week ago , hospitals have been relying on backup generators . Now they running dangerously low on fuel . The United Nations Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on Wednesday that Gaza Ministry of Health is redistributing fuel from other public facilities to keep hospital generators running . They running out of everything , says Zaher Sahloul , the president of MedGlobal , an NGO that is supporting medical facilities in Gaza . The International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC has said that without electricity , hospitals risk turning into morgues .',\n",
